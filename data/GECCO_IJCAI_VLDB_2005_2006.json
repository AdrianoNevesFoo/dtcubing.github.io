However, much less of such type of work has been done for efficient XSLT processing of XML documents stored and managed by the database. This is partially due to the observation that the rule based template driven XSLT execution model does not fit nicely with the traditional declarative query language processing model which leverages index probing and iterator based pull mode that can be scaled to handle large size data. In this paper, we share our experience of efficient processing of XSLT in Oracle XML DB. We present the technique of processing XSLT efficiently in database by rewriting XSLT stylesheets into highly efficient XQuery through partially evaluating XSLT over the XML documents structural information. Consequently, we can leverage all the work done for efficient XQueryXPath processing in database to achieve combined optimisations of XSLT with XQueryXPath and SQLXML in Oracle XMLDB. This effectively makes XSLT processing scale to large size XML documents using classical declarative query processing techniques in DBMS.|Zhen Hua Liu,Anguel Novoselsky","80548|VLDB|2005|Hubble An Advanced Dynamic Folder Technology for XML|A significant amount of information is stored in computer systems today, but people are struggling to manage their documents such that the information is easily found. XML is a de-facto standard for content publishing and data exchange. The proliferation of XML documents has created new challenges and opportunities for managing document collections. Existing technologies for automatically organizing document collections are either imprecise or based on only simple criteria. Since XML documents are self describing, it is now possible to automatically categorize XML documents precisely, according to their content. With the availability of the standard XML query languages, e.g. XQuery, much more powerful folder technologies are now feasible. To address this new challenge and exploit this new opportunity, this paper proposes a new and powerful dynamic folder mechanism, called Hubble. Hubble fully exploits the rich data model and semantic information embedded in the XML documents to build folder hierarchies dynamically and to categorize XML collections precisely. Besides supporting basic folder operations, Hubble also provides advanced features such as multi-path navigation and folder traversal across multiple document collections. Our performance study shows that Hubble is both efficient and scalable. Thus, it is an ideal technology for automating the process of organizing and categorizing XML documents.|Ning Li,Joshua Hui,Hui-I Hsiao,Kevin S.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs. It is also robust and bears negligible computational overhead.|Yi-Cheng Tu,Song Liu,Sunil Prabhakar,Bin Yao"],["57521|GECCO|2005|Breeding swarms a GAPSO hybrid|In this paper we propose a novel hybrid (GAPSO) algorithm, Breeding Swarms, combining the strengths of particle swarm optimization with genetic algorithms.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm. The experimental results indicate that MeSwarm outperforms the standard PSO and several evolutionary algorithms in terms of solution quality.|Bo-Fu Liu,Hung-Ming Chen,Jian-Hung Chen,Shiow-Fen Hwang,Shinn-Ying Ho","57849|GECCO|2006|Embedded cartesian genetic programming and the lawnmower and hierarchical-if-and-only-if problems|Embedded Cartesian Genetic Programming (ECGP) is an extension of the directed graph based Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP), which is capable of automatically acquiring, evolving and re-using partial solutions in the form of modules.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa","57330|GECCO|2005|Two improved differential evolution schemes for faster global search|Differential evolution (DE) is well known as a simple and efficient scheme for global optimization over continuous spaces.

Although investigations in delayed-reward (i.e. multi-step) environments have shown promise, XCS still struggles to efficiently find optimal solutions in environments with long action-chains. This paper highlights the strong relation of XCS to reinforcement learning and identifies some of the major differences. This makes it possible to add Eligibility Traces to XCS, a method taken from reinforcement learning to update the prediction of the whole action-chain on each step, which should cause prediction update to be faster and more accurate. However, it is shown that the discrete nature of the condition representation of a classifier and the operation of the genetic algorithm cause traces to propagate back incorrect prediction values and in some cases results in a decrease of system performance.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets.

A common variant of the view selection problem addressed in the literature minimizes the sum of maintenance cost and query time on the view set. Converting what is inherently an optimization problem with multiple conflicting objectives into one with a single objective ignores the need and value of a variety of solutions offering various levels of trade-off between the objectives. We apply two non-elitist multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to view selection under a size constraint. Our emphasis is to determine the suitability of the combination of MOEAs with constraint handling to the view selection problem, compared to a widely used greedy algorithm. We observe that the evolutionary process mimics that of the greedy in terms of the convergence process in the population. The MOEAs are competitive with the greedy on a variety of problem instances, often finding solutions dominating it in a reasonable amount of time.|Michael Lawrence","57461|GECCO|2005|Minimum spanning trees made easier via multi-objective optimization|Many real-world problems are multi-objective optimization problems and evolutionary algorithms are quite successful on such problems. Since the task is to compute or approximate the Pareto front, multi-objective optimization problems are considered as more difficult than single-objective problems. One should not forget that the fitness vector with respect to more than one objective contains more information that in principle can direct the search of evolutionary algorithms. Therefore, it is possible that a single-objective problem can be solved more efficiently via a generalized multi-objective model of the problem. That this is indeed the case is proved by investigating the computation of minimum spanning trees.|Frank Neumann,Ingo Wegener","57702|GECCO|2006|Incorporation of decision makers preference into evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms|The main characteristic feature of evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) is that no a priori information about the decision maker's preference is utilized in the search phase. EMO algorithms try to find a set of well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions with a wide range of objective values. It is, however, very difficult for EMO algorithms to find a good solution set of a multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem with many decision variables andor many objectives. In this paper, we propose an idea of incorporating the decision maker's preference into EMO algorithms to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal solutions of such a hard multiobjective optimization problem.|Hisao Ishibuchi,Yusuke Nojima,Kaname Narukawa,Tsutomu Doi","57699|GECCO|2006|Rotated test problems for assessing the performance of multi-objective optimization algorithms|This paper presents four rotatable multi-objective test problems that are designed for testing EMO (Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization) algorithms on their ability in dealing with parameter interactions.

Schema mappings are fundamental components for both data exchange and data integration. To date, a language for specifying (or programming) schema mappings exists. However, developmental support for programming schema mappings is still lacking. In particular, a tool for debugging schema mappings has not yet been developed. In this paper, we propose to build a debugger for understanding and exploring schema mappings. We present a primary feature of our debugger, called routes, that describes the relationship between source and target data with the schema mapping. We present two algorithms for computing all routes or one route for selected target data. Both algorithms execute in polynomial time in the size of the input. In computing all routes, our algorithm produces a concise representation that factors common steps in the routes. Furthermore, every minimal route for the selected data can, essentially, be found in this representation. Our second algorithm is able to produce one route fast, if there is one, and alternative routes as needed. We demonstrate the feasibility of our route algorithms through a set of experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets.|Laura Chiticariu,Wang Chiew Tan","16245|IJCAI|2005|Sophia A novel approach for Textual Case-based Reasoning|In this paper we present a novel methodology for textual case-based reasoning.

Such evolution causes invalidation of various artifacts depending on the schemas, such as schema mappings.

We present an extensible stream database system that allows scalable and flexible continuous queries on such streams. Application dependent streams and query functions are defined through an object-relational model. Distributed execution plans for continuous queries are described as high-level data flow distribution templates. Using a generic template we define two partitioning strategies for scalable parallel execution of expensive stream queries window split and window distribute. Window split provides operators for parallel execution of query functions by reducing the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluate these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that window split is favorable when expensive queries are executed on limited resources, while window distribution is better otherwise.|Milena Ivanova,Tore Risch","80712|VLDB|2006|State-Slice New Paradigm of Multi-query Optimization of Window-based Stream Queries|Modern stream applications such as sensor monitoring systems and publishsubscription services necessitate the handling of large numbers of continuous queries specified over high volume data streams. Efficient sharing of computations among multiple continuous queries, especially for the memory- and CPU-intensive window-based operations, is critical. A novel challenge in this scenario is to allow resource sharing among similar queries, even if they employ windows of different lengths. This paper first reviews the existing sharing methods in the literature, and then illustrates the significant performance shortcomings of these methods.This paper then presents a novel paradigm for the sharing of window join queries. Namely we slice window states of a join operator into fine-grained window slices and form a chain of sliced window joins. By using an elaborate pipelining methodology, the number of joins after state slicing is reduced from quadratic to linear. This novel sharing paradigm enables us to push selections down into the chain and flexibly select subsequences of such sliced window joins for computation sharing among queries with different window sizes. Based on the state-slice sharing paradigm, two algorithms are proposed for the chain buildup. One minimizes the memory consumption while the other minimizes the CPU usage. The algorithms are proven to find the optimal chain with respect to memory or CPU usage for a given query workload. We have implemented the slice-share paradigm within the data stream management system CAPE. The experimental results show that our strategy provides the best performance over a diverse range of workload settings among all alternate solutions in the literature.|Song Wang,Elke A.

In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis.

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm. The experimental results indicate that MeSwarm outperforms the standard PSO and several evolutionary algorithms in terms of solution quality.|Bo-Fu Liu,Hung-Ming Chen,Jian-Hung Chen,Shiow-Fen Hwang,Shinn-Ying Ho","57611|GECCO|2006|Adaptively choosing niching parameters in a PSO|Niching techniques play an important role in evolutionary algorithms.

This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space.

This is a difficult and still not completely understood process. Its critical part is the choice of a type of design representation. The paper addresses this important issue by presenting and discussing results of a large number of design experiments in which parameterized and generative representations were used. Particularly, their computational and design related advantages and disadvantages were investigated and compared.Evolutionary design experiments reported in this paper considered two classes of structural design problems, including the design of a wind bracing system and the design of an entire structural system in a tall building. Parameterized and generative representations of the structural systems were introduced and their basic features discussed. The generative representations investigated in the paper were inspired by the processes of morphogenesis occurring in nature. Specifically, one-dimensional cellular automata were used to develop, or 'grow,' structural designs from the corresponding 'design embryos.'.The conducted research led to three major conclusions. First, generative representations based on cellular automata proved to scale well with the size of the considered design problems. Second, generative representations outperformed parameterized representations in minimizing weight of the structural systems in our problem domain by generating better designs and finding them faster. Finally, extensive experimental studies showed significant differences in optimal settings for evolutionary design experiments for the two representation types. The rate of mutation operator, the size of the parent population, and the type of the evolutionary algorithm were identified as the evolutionary parameters having the largest impact on the performance of evolutionary design processes in our problem domain.|Rafal Kicinger,Tomasz Arciszewski,Kenneth A.

Such problems can be solved efficiently only through simultaneous improvements to each decision variable. Evaluation of EMO algorithms with respect to this class of problem has relevance to real-world problems, which are seldom separable. However, many EMO test problems do not have this characteristic. The proposed set of test problems in this paper is intended to address this important requirement. The design principles of these test problems and a description of each new test problem are presented. Experimental results on these problems using a Differential Evolution Multi-objective Optimization algorithm are presented and contrasted with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II).|Antony W.

Not only approaches that search for numeric test data for procedural test objects have been investigated, but also techniques for automatically generating test programs that represent object-oriented unit test cases. Compared to numeric test data, test programs optimized for object-oriented unit testing are more complex. Method call sequences that realize interesting test scenarios must be evolved. An arbitrary method call sequence is not necessarily feasible due to call dependences which exist among the methods that potentially appear in a method call sequence. The approach presented in this paper relies on a tree-based representation of method call sequences by which sequence feasibility is preserved throughout the entire search process. In contrast to other approaches in this area, neither repair of individuals nor penalty mechanisms are required. Strongly-typed genetic programming is employed to generate method call trees. In order to deal with runtime exceptions, we use an extended distance-based fitness function. We performed experiments with four test objects. The initial results are promising high code coverages were achieved completely automatically for all of the test objects.|Stefan Wappler,Joachim Wegener","57863|GECCO|2006|Reformulation of the generation of conformance testing sequences to the asymmetric travelling salesman problem|Protocol conformance testing generally involves checking whether the protocol under test conforms to the given specification.

The approach provides a technique for transforming the problem of the test sequence generation from a given FSM into one of finding the shortest path in the asymmetric travelling salesman problem by using one of the many existing meta-heuristic algorithms for addressing TSP.

However, the existence of state behavior in test objects presents additional challenges for Evolutionary Testing, not least because certain test goals may require a search for a sequence of inputs to the test object. Furthermore, state-based test objects often make use of internal variables such as boolean flags, enumerations and counters for managing or querying their internal state. These types of variables can lead to a loss of information in computing fitness values, producing coarse or flat fitness landscapes. This results in the search receiving less guidance, and the chances of finding required test data are decreased.This paper proposes an extended approach based on previous works. Input sequences are generated, and internal variable problems are addressed through hybridization with an extended Chaining Approach. The basic idea of the Chaining Approach is to find a sequence of statements, involving internal variables, which need to be executed prior to the test goal. By requiring these statements are executed, information previously unavailable to the search can be made use of, possibly guiding it into potentially promising and unexplored areas of the test object's input domain.

They are simple, easy to understand and inspire confidence. Many of these HAs are good for some problem instances while very poor for other cases. While Meta-Heuristics try to find which is the best heuristic andor parameters to apply for a given problem instance Hyper-Heuristics (HH) try to combine several heuristics in the same solution searching process, switching among them whenever the circumstances vary. Besides, instead to solve a single problem instance it tries to find a general algorithm to apply to whole families of problems. HH use evolutionary methods to search for such a problem-solving algorithm and, once produced, to apply it to any new problem instance desired. Learning Classifier Systems (LCS), and in particular XCS, represents an elegant and simple way to try to fabricate such a composite algorithm. This represents a different kind of problem to those already studied by the LCS community. Previous work, using single step environments, already showed the usefulness of the approach. This paper goes further and studies the novel use of multi-step environments for HH and an alternate way to consider states to see if chains of actions can be learnt. A non-trivial, NP-hard family of problems, the Bin Packing one, is used as benchmark for the procedure. Results of the approach are very encouraging, showing outperformance over all HAs used individually and over previously reported work by the authors, including non-LCS (a GA based approach used for the same BP set of problems) and LCS (using single step environments).|Javier G.

This operator, unlike other recent LCS approaches of smart recombination, does not learn the structure of the domain, but it merges the rules of N parents (N  ) to generate a new offspring. This merge process uses an heuristic that selects the minimum subset of candidate rules that obtains maximum training accuracy. Moreover the operator also includes a rule pruning scheme to avoid the inclusion of over-specific rules, and to guarantee as much as possible the robust behaviour of the LCS. This operator takes advantage from the fact that each individual in a Pittsburgh LCS is a complete solution, and the system has a global view of the solution space that the proposed rule selection algorithm exploits. We have empirically evaluated this operator using a recent LCS called GAssist. First with the standard LCS benchmark, the  bits multiplexer, and later using  standard real datasets. The results of the experiments over these datasets indicate that the new operator manages to increase the accuracy of the system over the classical crossover in  of the  datasets, and never having a significantly worse performance than the classic operator.|Jaume Bacardit,Natalio Krasnogor","57733|GECCO|2006|Fast rule matching for learning classifier systems via vector instructions|Over the last ten years XCS has become the standard for Michigan-style learning classifier systems (LCS). Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time.

Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies. The result is an ecology in which the representations are species.|James A. R.

A number of different serial and parallel versions of GA exist. In this paper, a pipelined version of the commonly used Genetic Algorithms and a corresponding hardware platform is described. The main idea of achieving pipelined execution of different operations of GA is to use a stochastic selection function which works with the fitness value of the candidate chromosome only. The modified algorithm is termed PLGA (Pipelined Genetic Algorithm). When executed in a CGA (Classical Genetic Algorithm) framework, the stochastic selection gives comparable performances with the roulette-wheel selection. In the pipelined hardware environment, PLGA will be much faster than the CGA. When executed on similar hardware platforms, PLGA may attain a maximum speedup of four over CGA. However, if CGA is executed in a uniprocessor system the speedup is much more. A comparison of PLGA against PGA (Parallel Genetic Algorithms) shows that PLGA may be even more effective than PGAs.

In these problems, an object's value density is the sum of the values associated with it divided by its weight. Two greedy heuristics for the quadratic problem examine objects for inclusion in the knapsack in descending order of their value densities. Two genetic algorithms encode candidate selections of objects as binary strings and generate only strings whose selections of objects have total weight no more than the knapsack's capacity. One GA is naive its operators apply no information about the values associated with objects. The second extends the naive GA with greedy techniques from the non-evolutionary heuristics.

Focusing on e-science, it can be observed that scientific experiments and observations in many fields, e. g., in physics and astronomy, create huge volumes of data which have to be interchanged and processed. With experimental and observational data coming in particular from sensors, online simulations, etc., the data has an inherently streaming nature. Furthermore, continuing advances will result in even higher data volumes, rendering storing all of the delivered data prior to processing increasingly impractical. Hence, in such e-science scenarios, processing and sharing of data streams will play a decisive role. It will enable new possibilities for researchers, since they will be able to subscribe to interesting data streams of other scientists without having to set up their own devices or experiments. This results in much better utilization of expensive equipment such as telescopes, satellites, etc. Further, processing and sharing data streams on-the-fly in the network helps to reduce network traffic and to avoid network congestion. Thus, even huge streams of data can be handled efficiently by removing unnecessary parts early on, e. g., by early filtering and aggregation, and by sharing previously generated data streams and processing results.|Richard Kuntschke,Bernhard Stegmaier,Alfons Kemper,Angelika Reiser","80658|VLDB|2006|TRAC Toward Recency and Consistency Reporting in a Database with Distributed Data Sources|Distributed computing environments, including workflows in computational grids, present challenges for monitoring, as the state of the system may be captured only in logs distributed throughout the system. One approach to monitoring such systems is to \"sniff\" these distributed logs and to store their transformed content in a DBMS. This centralizes the state and exposes it for querying unfortunately, it also creates uncertainty with respect to the recency and consistency of the data. Previous related work has focused on allowing queries to express currency and consistency constraints, which are then enforced by \"pulling\" data from the distributed sources on demand, or by requiring synchronous updates of a centralized data store. In some instances this is impossible due to legacy system issues or inefficient as the system scales to large numbers of processors. Accordingly, we propose that instead of enforcing consistency and recency, such monitoring systems should report these properties along with query results, with the hope that this will allow the data to be appropriately interpreted. We present techniques for reporting consistency and recency for queries and evaluate them with respect to efficiency and precision.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems. Initial results indicate that the approach improves algorithm performance, especially in problems where the frequency of objective change is high.|Iason Hatzakis,David Wallace","57700|GECCO|2006|Incorporating directional information within a differential evolution algorithm for multi-objective optimization|The field of Differential Evolution (DE) has demonstrated important advantages in single objective optimization.

Although promising results have already been obtained when combined with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), an important question remains what is the best way to integrate the use of gradient techniques in the evolutionary cycle of a MOEA. In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA. During optimization, the effectivity of the gradient techniques is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective operator to spend the most resources. In addition, we indicate how the multi-objective search can be stimulated to also search $mboxemphalong $ the Pareto front, ultimately resulting in a better and wider spread of solutions. We perform tests on a few well-known benchmark problems as well as two novel benchmark problems with specific gradient properties. We compare the results of our adaptive resource-allocation scheme with the same MOEA without the use of gradient techniques and a scheme in which resource allocation is constant. The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

The combination with gradient--based local search operators has however been limited to only a few studies. In the single--objective case it is known that the additional use of gradient information can be beneficial. In this paper we provide an analytical parametric description of the set of all non--dominated (i.e. most promising) directions in which a solution can be moved such that its objectives either improve or remain the same. Moreover, the parameters describing this set can be computed efficiently using only the gradients of the individual objectives. We use this result to hybridize an existing MOEA with a local search operator that moves a solution in a randomly chosen non--dominated improving direction. We test the resulting algorithm on a few well--known benchmark problems and compare the results with the same MOEA without local search and the same MOEA with gradient--based techniques that use only one objective at a time. The results indicate that exploiting gradient information based on the non--dominated improving directions is superior to using the gradients of the objectives separately and that it can furthermore improve the result of MOEAs in which no local search is used, given enough evaluations.|Peter A.

This operator, unlike other recent LCS approaches of smart recombination, does not learn the structure of the domain, but it merges the rules of N parents (N  ) to generate a new offspring. This merge process uses an heuristic that selects the minimum subset of candidate rules that obtains maximum training accuracy. Moreover the operator also includes a rule pruning scheme to avoid the inclusion of over-specific rules, and to guarantee as much as possible the robust behaviour of the LCS. This operator takes advantage from the fact that each individual in a Pittsburgh LCS is a complete solution, and the system has a global view of the solution space that the proposed rule selection algorithm exploits. We have empirically evaluated this operator using a recent LCS called GAssist. First with the standard LCS benchmark, the  bits multiplexer, and later using  standard real datasets.

In this process test case generation plays a crucial role, defining appropriate and error-sensitive test data. The evolutionary white-box testing is a promising approach for the complete automation of structure-oriented test case generation. Here, test case generation can be completely automated with the help of evolutionary algorithms. However, problem cases exist in which the evolutionary test is not able to find valid test data. Thus, in the case of not achieving a test goal, it is not known whether this is due to non-executable program code or a problem case. This paper will investigate how successfully a software measure can support an evolutionary white-box test if the measure can predict the test effort. Hence, the termination criteria of evolutionary white-box testing can be adapted to test goals with problem cases in such a way that problematic test goals are either excluded from the test in advance or can be covered due to an adequate termination criteria according to a software measure.

In the pipelined hardware environment, PLGA will be much faster than the CGA. When executed on similar hardware platforms, PLGA may attain a maximum speedup of four over CGA. However, if CGA is executed in a uniprocessor system the speedup is much more. A comparison of PLGA against PGA (Parallel Genetic Algorithms) shows that PLGA may be even more effective than PGAs. A scheme for realizing the hardware pipeline is also presented.

Accordingly, an unbalanced search can lead to premature convergence. GASOM, a novel Genetic Algorithm, addresses this problem by intelligent exploration techniques. The approach uses Self-Organizing Maps to mine data from the evolution process. The information obtained is successfully utilized to enhance the search strategy and confront genetic drift. This way, local optima are avoided and exploratory power is maintained. The evaluation of GASOM on well known problems shows that it effectively prevents premature convergence and seeks the global optimum. Particularly on deceptive and misleading functions it showed outstanding performance. Additionally, representing the search history by the Self-Organizing Map provides a visually pleasing insight into the state and course of evolution.|Heni Ben Amor,Achim Rettinger","57272|GECCO|2005|Advanced models of cellular genetic algorithms evaluated on SAT|Cellular genetic algorithms (cGAs) are mainly characterized by their spatially decentralized population, in which individuals can only interact with their neighbors.

Their major advantage lies in the fact that they are relatively simple to implement while they allow generalizations for a wide range of real world problems. The multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP), which belongs to the class of NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, is one of the variations of the knapsack problem. The MKP has a wide range of real world applications such as cargo loading, selecting projects to fund, budget management, cutting stock, etc. The MKP has been studied quite extensively in the EA community. Due to the constrained nature of the problem, constraint handling techniques gain great importance in the performance of the proposed EA approaches. In this study, the applicability of a generational EA that uses a penalty-based constraint handling technique and a gene locus based, asymmetric, adaptive mutation scheme is explored for the MKP. The effects of the parameters of the explored approach is determined through tests. Further experiments, using large MKP instances from commonly used benchmarks available through the Internet are performed. Comparison tables are given for the performance of the explored approach and other good performing EAs found in literature for the MKP. Results show that performance improves greatly when compared with other penalty-based techniques, but the explored approach is still not the best performer among all. However, unlike the explored technique, the EAs using the other constraint handling techniques require a great amount of extra computational effort and need heuristic information specific to the optimization problem. Based on these observations, and the fact that the performance difference between the explored scheme and the better performers is not too high, research on improving the explored approach is still in progress.|Sima Uyar,G√ºlsen Eryigit","57348|GECCO|2005|Knowledge insertion an efficient approach to reduce effort in simple genetic algorithms for unrestricted parallel equal machines scheduling|Simple Genetic Algorithms (SGAs) are blind search algorithms which only make use of the relative fitness of solutions and completely ignore the nature of the problem.

Focusing on e-science, it can be observed that scientific experiments and observations in many fields, e. g., in physics and astronomy, create huge volumes of data which have to be interchanged and processed. With experimental and observational data coming in particular from sensors, online simulations, etc., the data has an inherently streaming nature. Furthermore, continuing advances will result in even higher data volumes, rendering storing all of the delivered data prior to processing increasingly impractical. Hence, in such e-science scenarios, processing and sharing of data streams will play a decisive role. It will enable new possibilities for researchers, since they will be able to subscribe to interesting data streams of other scientists without having to set up their own devices or experiments. This results in much better utilization of expensive equipment such as telescopes, satellites, etc. Further, processing and sharing data streams on-the-fly in the network helps to reduce network traffic and to avoid network congestion. Thus, even huge streams of data can be handled efficiently by removing unnecessary parts early on, e. g., by early filtering and aggregation, and by sharing previously generated data streams and processing results.|Richard Kuntschke,Bernhard Stegmaier,Alfons Kemper,Angelika Reiser","80674|VLDB|2006|Safety Guarantee of Continuous Join Queries over Punctuated Data Streams|Continuous join queries (CJQ) are needed for correlating data from multiple streams. One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct.

This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard.

We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database.

Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata.

The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps.

Based on the results, we conclude that the restricted tournament selection and the proposed modified clearing approaches are better in terms of finding and maintaining the multiple optima.|Gulshan Singh,Kalyanmoy Deb","57621|GECCO|2006|Combining gradient techniques for numerical multi-objective evolutionary optimization|Recently, gradient techniques for solving numerical multi-objective optimization problems have appeared in the literature. Although promising results have already been obtained when combined with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), an important question remains what is the best way to integrate the use of gradient techniques in the evolutionary cycle of a MOEA. In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA. During optimization, the effectivity of the gradient techniques is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective operator to spend the most resources. In addition, we indicate how the multi-objective search can be stimulated to also search $mboxemphalong $ the Pareto front, ultimately resulting in a better and wider spread of solutions. We perform tests on a few well-known benchmark problems as well as two novel benchmark problems with specific gradient properties. We compare the results of our adaptive resource-allocation scheme with the same MOEA without the use of gradient techniques and a scheme in which resource allocation is constant. The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

Although there are advantages of knowing the range of each objective for Pareto-optimality and the shape of the Pareto-optimal frontier itself in a problem for an adequate decision-making, the task of choosing a single preferred Pareto-optimal solution is also an important task which has received a lukewarm attention so far. In this paper, we combine one such preference based strategy with an EMO methodology and demonstrate how, instead of one solution, a preferred set solutions near the reference points can be found parallely. We propose a modified EMO procedure based on the elitist non-dominated sorting GAor NSGA-II. On two-objective to -objective optimization problems, the modified NSGA-II approach shows its efficacy in finding an adequate set of Pareto-optimal points. Such procedures will provide the decision-maker with a set of solutions near herhis preference so that a better and a more reliable decision can be made.|Kalyanmoy Deb,J.

PESO algorithm proposes two new perturbation operators \"c-perturbation\" and \"m-perturbation\". The goal of these operators is to fight premature convergence and poor diversity issues observed in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) implementations. Constraint handling is based on simple feasibility rules. PESO is compared with respect to a highly competitive technique representative of the state-of-the-art in the area using a well-known benchmark for evolutionary constrained optimization. PESO matches most results and outperforms other PSO algorithms.|Angel Eduardo Mu√±oz Zavala,Arturo Hern√°ndez Aguirre,Enrique Ra√∫l Villa Diharce","57294|GECCO|2005|Fitness inheritance for noisy evolutionary multi-objective optimization|This paper compares the performance of anti-noise methods, particularly probabilistic and re-sampling methods, using NSGA. It then proposes a computationally less expensive approach to counteracting noise using re-sampling and fitness inheritance. Six problems with different difficulties are used to test the methods. The results indicate that the probabilistic approach has better convergence to the Pareto optimal front, but it looses diversity quickly. However, methods based on re-sampling are more robust against noise but they are computationally very expensive to use. The proposed fitness inheritance approach is very competitive to re-sampling methods with much lower computational cost.|Lam Thu Bui,Hussein A.

The results obtained show that it is possible to reduce the computational cost by % without affecting the quality of the obtained Pareto front.|Margarita Reyes Sierra,Carlos A. Coello Coello","57308|GECCO|2005|Exploiting gradient information in numerical multi--objective evolutionary optimization|Various multi--objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have obtained promising results on various numerical multi--objective optimization problems. The combination with gradient--based local search operators has however been limited to only a few studies. In the single--objective case it is known that the additional use of gradient information can be beneficial. In this paper we provide an analytical parametric description of the set of all non--dominated (i.e. most promising) directions in which a solution can be moved such that its objectives either improve or remain the same. Moreover, the parameters describing this set can be computed efficiently using only the gradients of the individual objectives. We use this result to hybridize an existing MOEA with a local search operator that moves a solution in a randomly chosen non--dominated improving direction. We test the resulting algorithm on a few well--known benchmark problems and compare the results with the same MOEA without local search and the same MOEA with gradient--based techniques that use only one objective at a time. The results indicate that exploiting gradient information based on the non--dominated improving directions is superior to using the gradients of the objectives separately and that it can furthermore improve the result of MOEAs in which no local search is used, given enough evaluations.|Peter A.

As a consequence premature convergence or ending up in a local optimum in multi-modal fitness landscapes can occur. In this article a new approach controlling the process of self-adaptation is proposed. This approach combines the old ideas of gene deletion and gene duplication with the self-adaptation mechanism of the ES. Gene deletion and gene duplication is used to vary the number of independent mutation strengths. In order to demonstrate the practicability of the new approach several multi-modal test functions are used. Methods from statistical design of experiments and regression tree methods are applied to improve the performance of a specific heuristic-problem combination.|Karlheinz Schmitt","57513|GECCO|2005|Using predators and preys in evolution strategies|This poster presents an evolution strategy for single- and multi-objective optimization. The model uses the predator-prey approach from ecology to scale between both cases.

Particular, the well proved self-adaptation mechanism for the mutation strengths in the single-objective case is adopted for the multi-objective one. This self-adaptation process is supported by a new strategy of competition between predators and preys.

We employed Differential Evolution (DE) for optimizing the network parameters to capture the dynamics in gene expression data. In a preliminary investigation we ascertain the suitability of DE for a multimodal and strongly non-linear problem like gene network estimation. An extension of the fitness function for attaining the sparse structure of biological networks has been proposed. For estimating the parameter values more accurately an enhancement of the optimization procedure has been also suggested. The effectiveness of the proposed method was justified performing experiments on a genetic network using different numbers of artificially created time series data.|Nasimul Noman,Hitoshi Iba","57728|GECCO|2006|Mixed-integer optimization of coronary vessel image analysis using evolution strategies|In this paper we compare Mixed-Integer Evolution Strategies (MI-ES)and standard Evolution Strategies (ES)when applied to find optimal solutions for artificial test problems and medical image processing problems. MI-ES are special instantiations of standard ES that can solve optimization problems with different objective variable types (continuous, integer, and nominal discrete). Artificial test problems are generated with a mixed-integer test generator.The practical image processing problem iss the detection of the lumen boundary in IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)images. Based on the experimental results, it is shown that MI-ES generally perform better than standard ES on both artifical and practical image processing problems.

The aim is to identify which one of them is more suitable to solve an optimization problem, depending on the problem's features and also to identify the variant with the best performance, regardless of the features of the problem to be solved. Eight variants were implemented and tested on  benchmark problems taken from the specialized literature. These variants vary in the type of recombination operator used and also in the way in which the mutation is computed. A set of statistical tests were performed in order to obtain more confidence on the validity of the results and to reinforce our discussion. The main aim is that this study can help both researchers and practitioners interested in using differential evolution as a global optimizer, since we expect that our conclusions can provide some insights regarding the advantages or limitations of each of the variants studied.|Efr√©n Mezura-Montes,Jes√∫s Vel√°zquez-Reyes,Carlos A.

The proposed model differs from conventional DE by applying selection both for reproduction and survival, whereas the original model applies exclusively \"knock-out\" selection mechanism for survival. Because of its one-to-one reproduction strategy DE often consumes too many fitness evaluations to locate the global optimum. In this work we show that selecting parents for breeding and offspring for survival, DE's search capability can be further accelerated, which will be particularly useful for expensive function optimizations. Computational results using many benchmark functions are reported which show significant improvements in the convergence characteristics of the proposed algorithm over the original one.|Nasimul Noman,Hitoshi Iba","57399|GECCO|2005|Efficient differential evolution using speciation for multimodal function optimization|In this paper differential evolution is extended by using the notion of speciation for solving multimodal optimization problems. The proposed species-based DE (SDE) is able to locate multiple global optima simultaneously through adaptive formation of multiple species (or subpopulations) in an DE population at each iteration step. Each species functions as an DE by itself. Successive local improvements through species formation can eventually transform into global improvements in identifying multiple global optima. In this study the performance of SDE is compared with another recently proposed DE variant CrowdingDE. The computational complexity of SDE, the effect of population size and species radius on SDE are investigated. SDE is found to be more computationally efficient than CrowdingDE over a number of benchmark multimodal test functions.|Xiaodong Li","57685|GECCO|2006|A new proposal for multi-objective optimization using differential evolution and rough sets theory|This paper presents a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on differential evolution and rough sets theory. The proposed approach adopts an external archive in order to retain the nondominated solutions found during the evolutionary process. Additionally, the approach also incorporates the concept of pa-dominance to get a good distribution of the solutions retained. The main idea of the approach is to use differential evolution (DE) as our main search engine, trying to translate its good convergence properties exhibited in single-objective optimization to the multi-objective case. Rough sets theory is adopted in a second stage of the search in order to improve the spread of the nondominated solutions that have been found so far. Our hybrid approach is validated using standard test functions and metrics commonly adopted in the specialized literature.
