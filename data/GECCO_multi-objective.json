GNP is an evolutionary computation, which represents its solutions using graph structures and has some useful features inherently. It has been clarified that GNP works well especially in dynamic environments since GNP can create quite compact programs and has an implicit memory function. In this paper, GNP is applied to creating a stock trading model. There are three important points The first important point is to combine GNP with Sarsa Learning which is one of the reinforcement learning algorithms. Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of  brands in ,  and . Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in . From the simulation results, it is clarified that the trading rules of the proposed method obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method and its effectiveness has been confirmed.|Yan Chen,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu",

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa",

We relate the runtime of our algorithms to the input size and the cost of a minimum solution and point out that the search process of evolutionary algorithms creates partial solutions that are similar to the effect of a kernelization (i.e. a special type of preprocessing from parameterized complexity). Based on this, we show that evolutionary algorithms solve the vertex cover problem efficiently if the size of a minimum vertex cover is not too large, i.e. the expected runtime is bounded by O(f(OPT) nc), where c is a constant and f a function that only depends on OPT. This shows that evolutionary algorithms are randomized fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for the vertex cover problem.|Stefan Kratsch,Frank Neumann",

In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA. During optimization, the effectivity of the gradient techniques is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective operator to spend the most resources.

We perform tests on a few well-known benchmark problems as well as two novel benchmark problems with specific gradient properties. We compare the results of our adaptive resource-allocation scheme with the same MOEA without the use of gradient techniques and a scheme in which resource allocation is constant. The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

To achieve convergence, most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms today employ Pareto-ranking as the main criteria for fitness calculation. The computation of Pareto-rank in a population is time consuming, and arguably the most computationally expensive component in an iteration of the said algorithms. This paper proposes a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm which avoids Pareto-ranking altogether by employing the transitivity of the domination relation. The proposed algorithm is an elitist algorithm with explicit diversity preservation procedure. It applies a measure reflecting the degree of domination between solutions in a steady-state replacement strategy to determine which individuals survive to the next iteration. Results on nine standard test functions demonstrated that the algorithm performs favorably compared to the popular NSGA-II in terms of convergence as well as diversity of the Pareto-set approximation, and is computationally more efficient.|Dipti Srinivasan,Lily Rachmawati"

In contrast to the single-objective case, diversity can be introduced by the multi-objective view of the algorithm and the dynamic use of objectives. Using the travelling salesman problem as an example we illustrate that two basic approaches, a) the addition of new objectives to the existing problem and b) the decomposition of the primary objective into sub-objectives, can improve performance compared to a single-objective genetic algorithm when objectives are used dynamically. Based on decomposition we propose the concept \"Multi-Objectivization via Segmentation\" (MOS), at which the original problem is reassembled.

It is, however, well-known that Pareto-dominance-based algorithms do not always work well on many-objective problems with more than three objectives. Currently alternative frameworks are studied in the EMO community very actively. One promising framework is the use of an indicator function to find a good solution set of a multiobjective problem. EMO algorithms with this framework are called indicator-based evolutionary algorithms (IBEAs) where the hypervolume measure is frequently used as an indicator.

Usually the focus lies on objective space properties such as the front shape and the distribution of optimal solutions. However, structural characteristics in the decision space can also provide valuable insights. In certain applications, it may even be more important to find a structurally diverse set of close-to-optimal solutions than to identify a set of optimal but structurally similar solutions. Accordingly, multiobjective optimizers are required that are capable of considering both the objective space quality of a Pareto-set approximation and its diversity in the decision space. Although NSGA, one of the first multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, explicitly considered decision space diversity, only a few other studies address that issue. It therefore is an open research question how modern multiobjective evolutionary algorithms can be adapted to search for structurally diverse high-quality Pareto-set approximations. To this end we propose an approach to integrate decision space diversity into hypervolume-based multiobjective search. We present a modified hypervolume indicator and integrate it into an evolutionary algorithm.

Despite successful usage of GP to define and select the appropriate image texture operators for feature extraction from remotely sensed imagery , , the increased search space can lead to sub-optimal situations as result of the algorithm being trapped in local minimum regions. The causality involved in the randomly generated seed, from which the algorithm begins, can impact the algorithm's final outcome . Burke et al.  described the correlation between population heterogeneity, or diversity, and best-of-generation fitness. Population diversity is a key component of the biological evolution theory and its maintenance during the evolutionary process is a vital procedure to avoid premature convergence (sub-optimal solutions) ,. The case of discerning timber forests from naturally occurring forests using high spatial resolution satellite-borne imagery was chosen to evaluate two methods of population restarting. Despite of the spectral similarities of these features, the row patterns present in the timber forests were explored using six convolution type textural operators. The new image has  channels four original channels plus  new channels from the textural operators. Two methods for the introduction of new genetic material during the evolutionary process were investigated one in which the new population is created by fitness sorting (method ) and another in which the new population is created by mixing (method ). A total of  realizations were performed for each of the population restarting methods considered (no restarting, method , and method ).. The top plot in Figure  shows the averaged best of population fitness values for all realizations of each generation. The middle plot shows average dissimilarity and the lower plot average entropy values for all the realizations for each generation. On average, the experiment with no restarting asymptotically converges to a ceiling fitness value starting approximately at generation . This coincides with the lack of population diversity represented by both dissimilarity and entropy. Conversely, on average, restarting methods  and  maintained more diverse populations, yielding higher final fitness values representing a better convergence toward the global minimum. The overall variability, represented by standard deviation of final fitness values, was reduced from . for the experiment with no restarting, to . and . for methods  and  respectively. The enlarged search space caused by the additional textural channels increased the system overall variability compromising the system's convergence toward the global minimum. The significant positive relationship between population diversity, indicated by the results, is supported by similar results found in the literature , , . Introducing new genetic material into the evolutionary process designed to increase and to maintain population diversity, improved convergence, and ultimately reduced the system's overall variability|Henrique G.

NQEA uses a new Q-bit update operator to increase the balance between the exploration and exploitation of the search space. In the operator, first, the Q-bits of each individual in the population are updated based on the personal best measurement of that individual and the best measurement of current generation. Then, a restriction is applied to each Q-bit to prevent the premature convergence of its values. The results of experiments on the - knapsack and NK-landscapes problems show that NQEA performs better than a classical genetic algorithm, CGA, and two quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms, QEA and vQEA, in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.|Parvaz Mahdabi,Mahdi Abadi,Saeed Jalili",

The aim is twofold () to allow infeasible solutions with a promising value of the objective function to remain in the population and also () to increase the probabilities of an individual to generate a better offspring while promoting collaboration of all the population to generate better solutions. These goals are achieved by allowing each parent to generate more than one offspring. The best offspring is selected using a comparison mechanism based on feasibility and this child is compared against its parent. To maintain diversity, the proposed approach uses a mechanism successfully adopted with other evolutionary algorithms where, based on a parameter Sr a solution (between the best offspring and the current parent) with a better value of the objective function can remain in the population, regardless of its feasibility. The proposed approach is validated using test functions from a well-known benchmark commonly adopted to validate constraint-handling techniques used with evolutionary algorithms. The statistical results obtained by the proposed approach are highly competitive (based on quality, robustness and number of evaluations of the objective function) with respect to other constraint-handling techniques, either based on differential evolution or on other evolutionary algorithms, that are representative of the state-of-the-art in the area.

To achieve convergence, most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms today employ Pareto-ranking as the main criteria for fitness calculation. The computation of Pareto-rank in a population is time consuming, and arguably the most computationally expensive component in an iteration of the said algorithms. This paper proposes a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm which avoids Pareto-ranking altogether by employing the transitivity of the domination relation. The proposed algorithm is an elitist algorithm with explicit diversity preservation procedure. It applies a measure reflecting the degree of domination between solutions in a steady-state replacement strategy to determine which individuals survive to the next iteration. Results on nine standard test functions demonstrated that the algorithm performs favorably compared to the popular NSGA-II in terms of convergence as well as diversity of the Pareto-set approximation, and is computationally more efficient.|Dipti Srinivasan,Lily Rachmawati",

Defining distance measures bound to genetic operators is a very important task in evolutionary computation. In fact these distances usually make the analysis of some indicators of the the search process, like for instance population diversity or well-known measures of problem hardness such as fitness distance correlation, more accurate. In this paper, we introduce a distance measure bound to one point standard crossover for genetic algorithms. This measure quantifies the minimum number of crossover operations that have to be applied to a population to tranform it into another population. It is based on the definition of a lattice over some particular schemata that represent the individuals in the population and on the construction of a discrete dynamic system that models the dynamics of the genetic algorithm under the sole effect of crossover. Using this distance measure, it is also possible to build a family of distances between individuals.|Luca Manzoni,Leonardo Vanneschi,Giancarlo Mauri",

This study is focused on diversity maintenance schemes. A new update strategy for UMDA's probability model, based on Ant Colony Optimization transition probability equations, is presented and empirically compared with other strategies recently published that aim to correct diversity loss in UMDA. Results demonstrate that loss correction strategies delay or avoid full convergence, thus increasing UMDA's adaptability to changing environments. However, the strategy proposed in this paper achieves a higher performance on the DOP test set when compared with other methods.

Neuroevolutionary (NE) algorithms, such as NEAT, have also benefitted from niching. However, the latest research indicates that the use of genotype- or phenotype-similarity-based niching schemes in NE algorithms is not highly effective because these schemes have difficulty sustaining the behavioral diversity in the environment. In this paper, we propose a novel niching scheme that takes into consideration both the phenotypic and behavioral diversity, and then integrate it with NEAT. An experimental analysis revealed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the original NEAT for various problem settings. More interestingly, it performs especially well for problems with a high noise level and large state space. Since these features are common in problems to which NEAT is applied, the proposed algorithm should be effective in practice.|Hirotaka Moriguchi,Shinichi Honiden",

Evolutionary computation is one of the most promising approaches to reinforcement learning but its success is largely restricted to off-line scenarios. In on-line scenarios, an agent must strive to maximize the reward it accrues while it is learning. Temporal difference (TD) methods, another approach to reinforcement learning, naturally excel in on-line scenarios because they have selection mechanisms for balancing the need to search for better policies exploration) with the need to accrue maximal reward (exploitation). This paper presents a novel way to strike this balance in evolutionary methods by borrowing the selection mechanisms used by TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolution to choose policies for evaluation. Empirical results in the mountain car and server job scheduling domains demonstrate that these techniques can substantially improve evolution's on-line performance in stochastic domains.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone",

In order to estimate such a conditional probability distribution, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) by Lafferty et al. is newly introduced into EDAs in this paper. The reason for adopting CRFs is that CRFs are able to learn conditional probabilistic distributions from a large amount of input-output data, i.e., episodes in the case of reinforcement learning problems.

We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors.

The evolutionary white-box testing is a promising approach for the complete automation of structure-oriented test case generation. Here, test case generation can be completely automated with the help of evolutionary algorithms. However, problem cases exist in which the evolutionary test is not able to find valid test data. Thus, in the case of not achieving a test goal, it is not known whether this is due to non-executable program code or a problem case. This paper will investigate how successfully a software measure can support an evolutionary white-box test if the measure can predict the test effort. Hence, the termination criteria of evolutionary white-box testing can be adapted to test goals with problem cases in such a way that problematic test goals are either excluded from the test in advance or can be covered due to an adequate termination criteria according to a software measure.

        "57440|GECCO|2005|Evolutionary testing of state-based programs|The application of Evolutionary Algorithms to structural test data generation, known as Evolutionary Testing, has to date largely focused on programs with input-output behavior. However, the existence of state behavior in test objects presents additional challenges for Evolutionary Testing, not least because certain test goals may require a search for a sequence of inputs to the test object. Furthermore, state-based test objects often make use of internal variables such as boolean flags, enumerations and counters for managing or querying their internal state. These types of variables can lead to a loss of information in computing fitness values, producing coarse or flat fitness landscapes. This results in the search receiving less guidance, and the chances of finding required test data are decreased.This paper proposes an extended approach based on previous works. Input sequences are generated, and internal variable problems are addressed through hybridization with an extended Chaining Approach. The basic idea of the Chaining Approach is to find a sequence of statements, involving internal variables, which need to be executed prior to the test goal. By requiring these statements are executed, information previously unavailable to the search can be made use of, possibly guiding it into potentially promising and unexplored areas of the test object's input domain. A number of experiments demonstrate the value of the approach.|Phil McMinn,Mike Holcombe",

So called Pareto coevolution treats the coevolving set of test cases as objectives to be optimized in the sense of multi-objective optimization. Pareto coevolution can be seen as a relaxation of traditional multi-objective evolutionary optimization. Rather than being forced to determine the outcome of a particular individual on every objective, pareto coevolution allows the examination of an individual's outcome on a particular objective. By introducing the notion of certifying pareto dominance and mutual non-dominance, this paper proves for the first time that free lunches exist for the class of pareto coevolutionary optimization problems. This theoretical result is of particular interest because we explicitly provide an algorithm for pareto coevolution which has better performance, on average, than all traditional multi-objective algorithms in the relaxed setting of pareto coevolution. The notion of certificates of preferencenon-preference has potential implications for coevolutionary algorithm design in many classes of coevolution as well as for general multi-objective optimization in the relaxed setting of pareto coevolution.|Travis C.

Over these kind of over changing, complex and ubiquitous real-world problems, the explorative-exploitive subtle counterbalance character of our current state-of-the-art search algorithms should be biased towards an increased explorative behavior. While counterproductive in classic problems, the main and obvious reason of using it in severe dynamic problems is simple while we engage ourselves in exploiting the extrema, the extrema moves elsewhere. In order to tackle this subtle compromise, we propose a novel algorithm for optimization in dynamic binary landscapes, stressing the role of negative feedback mechanisms. The Binary Ant Algorithm (BAA) mimics some aspects of social insects' behavior. Like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), BAA acts by building pheromone maps over a graph of possible trails representing pseudo-solutions of increasing quality to a specific optimization problem. Main differences rely on the way this search space is represented and provided to the colony in order to exploreexploit it, while and more important, we enrol in providing strong evaporation to the problem-habitat. By a process of pheromone reinforcement and evaporation the artificial insect's trails over the graph converge to regions near the ideal solution of the optimization problem. Over each generation, positive feedbacks made available by pheromone reinforcement consolidate the best solutions found so far, while enhanced negative feedbacks given by the evaporation mechanism provided the system with population diversity and fast self-adaptive characteristics, allowing BAA to be particularly suitable for severe complex dynamic optimization problems. Experiments made with some well known test functions frequently used in the Evolutionary Algorithms' research field illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

Most of the published approaches to stimulate exploration rely on a distance between genotypes or phenotypes however, such distances are difficult to compute when evolving neural networks due to () the algorithmic complexity of graph similarity measures, () the competing conventions problem and () the complexity of most neural-network encodings. In this paper, we introduce and compare two conceptually simple, yet efficient methods to improve exploration and avoid premature convergence when evolving both the topology and the parameters of neural networks. The two proposed methods, respectively called behavioral novelty and behavioral diversity, are built on multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and on a user-defined distance between behaviors. They can be employed with any genotype. We benchmarked them on the evolution of a neural network to compute a Boolean function with a deceptive fitness. The results obtained with the two proposed methods are statistically similar to those of NEAT and substantially better than those of the control experiment and of a phenotype-based diversity mechanism.|Jean-Baptiste Mouret,St\u00e9phane Doncieux",

The challenge resides in the selection of the appropriate texture operators and their parameters from a larger set of possible textural operators. This matter is especially difficult when addressing problems using remotely sensed imagery. The presence of additional spectral channels increases the search space. Genetic programming (GP) algorithms have being used as a cost-effective alternative to trial-and-error approach performed by human image analysts due to its optimized combinatorial search. Despite successful usage of GP to define and select the appropriate image texture operators for feature extraction from remotely sensed imagery , , the increased search space can lead to sub-optimal situations as result of the algorithm being trapped in local minimum regions. The causality involved in the randomly generated seed, from which the algorithm begins, can impact the algorithm's final outcome . Burke et al.  described the correlation between population heterogeneity, or diversity, and best-of-generation fitness. Population diversity is a key component of the biological evolution theory and its maintenance during the evolutionary process is a vital procedure to avoid premature convergence (sub-optimal solutions) ,. The case of discerning timber forests from naturally occurring forests using high spatial resolution satellite-borne imagery was chosen to evaluate two methods of population restarting. Despite of the spectral similarities of these features, the row patterns present in the timber forests were explored using six convolution type textural operators. The new image has  channels four original channels plus  new channels from the textural operators. Two methods for the introduction of new genetic material during the evolutionary process were investigated one in which the new population is created by fitness sorting (method ) and another in which the new population is created by mixing (method ). A total of  realizations were performed for each of the population restarting methods considered (no restarting, method , and method ).. The top plot in Figure  shows the averaged best of population fitness values for all realizations of each generation. The middle plot shows average dissimilarity and the lower plot average entropy values for all the realizations for each generation. On average, the experiment with no restarting asymptotically converges to a ceiling fitness value starting approximately at generation . This coincides with the lack of population diversity represented by both dissimilarity and entropy. Conversely, on average, restarting methods  and  maintained more diverse populations, yielding higher final fitness values representing a better convergence toward the global minimum. The overall variability, represented by standard deviation of final fitness values, was reduced from . for the experiment with no restarting, to . and . for methods  and  respectively. The enlarged search space caused by the additional textural channels increased the system overall variability compromising the system's convergence toward the global minimum. The significant positive relationship between population diversity, indicated by the results, is supported by similar results found in the literature , , .

The aim is twofold () to allow infeasible solutions with a promising value of the objective function to remain in the population and also () to increase the probabilities of an individual to generate a better offspring while promoting collaboration of all the population to generate better solutions. These goals are achieved by allowing each parent to generate more than one offspring. The best offspring is selected using a comparison mechanism based on feasibility and this child is compared against its parent. To maintain diversity, the proposed approach uses a mechanism successfully adopted with other evolutionary algorithms where, based on a parameter Sr a solution (between the best offspring and the current parent) with a better value of the objective function can remain in the population, regardless of its feasibility. The proposed approach is validated using test functions from a well-known benchmark commonly adopted to validate constraint-handling techniques used with evolutionary algorithms. The statistical results obtained by the proposed approach are highly competitive (based on quality, robustness and number of evaluations of the objective function) with respect to other constraint-handling techniques, either based on differential evolution or on other evolutionary algorithms, that are representative of the state-of-the-art in the area.

To achieve convergence, most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms today employ Pareto-ranking as the main criteria for fitness calculation. The computation of Pareto-rank in a population is time consuming, and arguably the most computationally expensive component in an iteration of the said algorithms. This paper proposes a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm which avoids Pareto-ranking altogether by employing the transitivity of the domination relation. The proposed algorithm is an elitist algorithm with explicit diversity preservation procedure. It applies a measure reflecting the degree of domination between solutions in a steady-state replacement strategy to determine which individuals survive to the next iteration. Results on nine standard test functions demonstrated that the algorithm performs favorably compared to the popular NSGA-II in terms of convergence as well as diversity of the Pareto-set approximation, and is computationally more efficient.|Dipti Srinivasan,Lily Rachmawati",

One goal of human genetics is to use data mining and machine learning methods to identify combinations of genetic variations that are predictive of discrete measures of health in human population data. \"Artificial evolution\" approaches loosely based on real biological processes have been developed and applied in this domain, but it has recently been suggested that \"computational evolution\" approaches which incorporate additional biological and evolutionary complexity into existing algorithms will be more likely to solve problems of interest to biologists and biomedical researchers. Here we introduce a method to evolve compact solutions by adding environmental noise to a dataset during fitness evaluation. In ecological systems a highly specialized organism can fail to thrive as the environment changes. By introducing numerous small changes into training data, i.e. the environment, during evolution we similarly drive selection towards more general solutions. We show that this improves the power of the computational evolution system when modest amounts of noise are used. Furthermore, this method of changing the environment in which fitness is evaluated with small perturbations fits within the computational evolution framework and is an effective method of controlling solution size for problems where the data are likely to be noisy.|Casey S.

However, the latest research indicates that the use of genotype- or phenotype-similarity-based niching schemes in NE algorithms is not highly effective because these schemes have difficulty sustaining the behavioral diversity in the environment. In this paper, we propose a novel niching scheme that takes into consideration both the phenotypic and behavioral diversity, and then integrate it with NEAT. An experimental analysis revealed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the original NEAT for various problem settings. More interestingly, it performs especially well for problems with a high noise level and large state space. Since these features are common in problems to which NEAT is applied, the proposed algorithm should be effective in practice.|Hirotaka Moriguchi,Shinichi Honiden",

Their highly multi-modal and discrete search space often makes the required performance out of reach to current MOEAs. Examining the fundamental cause of premature convergence in evolutionary search has led to proposing of a generic framework, named Hierarchical Fair Competition (HFC), for robust and sustainable evolutionary search. Here an HFC-based Hierarchical Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization framework (HEMO) is proposed, which is characterized by its simultaneous maintenance of individuals of all degrees of evolution in hierarchically organized repositories, by its continuous inflow of random individuals at the base repository, by its intrinsic hierarchical elitism and hyper-grid-based density estimation. Two experiments demonstrate its search robustness and its capability to provide sustainable evolutionary search for difficult multi-modal problems. HEMO makes it possible to do reliable multi-objective search without risk of premature convergence. The paradigmatic transition of HEMO to handle premature convergence is that instead of trying to escape local optima from converged high fitness populations, it tries to maintain the opportunity for new optima to emerge from the bottom up as enabled by its hierarchical organization of individuals of different fitnesses.|Jianjun Hu,Kisung Seo,Zhun Fan,Ronald C.

The ability to evolve effective air traffic flow strategies depends not only on evolving good local strategies, but also on ensuring that those local strategies result in good global solutions. While traditional, direct evolutionary strategies can be highly effective in certain combinatorial domains, they are not well-suited to complex air traffic flow problems because of the large interdependencies among the local subsystems. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary agent-based solution to the air traffic flow problem. In this approach, we evolve agents both to learn the right local flow strategies to alleviate congestion in their immediate surroundings, and to prevent the creation of congestion \"downstream\" from their local areas. The agent-based approach leads to better and more fault-tolerant solutions. To validate this approach, we use FACET, an air traffic simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry. On a scenario composed of three hundred aircraft and two points of congestion, our results show that an agent based evolutionary computation method, where each agent uses the system evaluation function, achieves % improvement over a direct evolutionary algorithm. In addition by creating agent-specific \"difference evaluation functions\" we achieve an additional % improvement over agents using the system evaluation.|Adrian K. Agogino,Kagan Tumer",

Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining.

To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme.

The proposed mating scheme is a two-stage selection mechanism. In the first stage, standard fitness-based selection is iterated for selecting a pre-specified number of candidate solutions from the current population. In the second stage, similarity-based tournament selection is used for choosing a pair of parents among the candidate solutions selected in the first stage. For maintaining the diversity of solutions, selection probabilities of parents are biased toward extreme solutions that are different from prototypical (i.e., average) solutions. At the same time, our mating scheme uses a mechanism where similar parents are more likely to be chosen for improving the convergence speed to the Pareto-front. Through computational experiments on multi-objective knapsack problems, it is shown that the performance of recently proposed well-known EMO algorithms (SPEA and NSGA-II) can be improved by our mating scheme.|Hisao Ishibuchi,Youhei Shibata",

The challenge resides in the selection of the appropriate texture operators and their parameters from a larger set of possible textural operators. This matter is especially difficult when addressing problems using remotely sensed imagery. The presence of additional spectral channels increases the search space. Genetic programming (GP) algorithms have being used as a cost-effective alternative to trial-and-error approach performed by human image analysts due to its optimized combinatorial search. Despite successful usage of GP to define and select the appropriate image texture operators for feature extraction from remotely sensed imagery , , the increased search space can lead to sub-optimal situations as result of the algorithm being trapped in local minimum regions. The causality involved in the randomly generated seed, from which the algorithm begins, can impact the algorithm's final outcome . Burke et al.  described the correlation between population heterogeneity, or diversity, and best-of-generation fitness. Population diversity is a key component of the biological evolution theory and its maintenance during the evolutionary process is a vital procedure to avoid premature convergence (sub-optimal solutions) ,. The case of discerning timber forests from naturally occurring forests using high spatial resolution satellite-borne imagery was chosen to evaluate two methods of population restarting. Despite of the spectral similarities of these features, the row patterns present in the timber forests were explored using six convolution type textural operators. The new image has  channels four original channels plus  new channels from the textural operators. Two methods for the introduction of new genetic material during the evolutionary process were investigated one in which the new population is created by fitness sorting (method ) and another in which the new population is created by mixing (method ). A total of  realizations were performed for each of the population restarting methods considered (no restarting, method , and method ).. The top plot in Figure  shows the averaged best of population fitness values for all realizations of each generation. The middle plot shows average dissimilarity and the lower plot average entropy values for all the realizations for each generation. On average, the experiment with no restarting asymptotically converges to a ceiling fitness value starting approximately at generation . This coincides with the lack of population diversity represented by both dissimilarity and entropy. Conversely, on average, restarting methods  and  maintained more diverse populations, yielding higher final fitness values representing a better convergence toward the global minimum. The overall variability, represented by standard deviation of final fitness values, was reduced from . for the experiment with no restarting, to . and . for methods  and  respectively. The enlarged search space caused by the additional textural channels increased the system overall variability compromising the system's convergence toward the global minimum. The significant positive relationship between population diversity, indicated by the results, is supported by similar results found in the literature , , .

It was observed that the highly constrained nature of the problem resulted in the dominance of the search by a single topology. This paper, introduces an new evolutionary algorithm operator that prevents topology dominance by penalizing solutions that have a dominant topology.The operator results in a range of dynamic behavior for the rates of growth in topology dominance. Similarly, the application of the ageing penalty can result in the attenuation of topology dominance, or more severely, the complete removal of a topology from the search. It was also observed that following the penalization of a dominant topology, the search was dynamically re-seeded with both new and previously evaluated topologies. It is concluded that the operator prevents topology dominance and increases the exploratory power of the algorithm.The application of an evolutionary algorithm with ageing to the synthesis of HVAC system configurations resulted in a novel design solution having a % lower energy use than the best of conventional system designs.|Jonathan Wight,Yi Zhang",
        "58953|GECCO|2010|Definition of a crossover based distance for genetic algorithms|Distances that are bound to (or consistent with) genetic operators are measures that quantify the difficulty of reaching and individual (or a population) starting from another individual (or population) and applying the genetic operator iteratively. Defining distance measures bound to genetic operators is a very important task in evolutionary computation. In fact these distances usually make the analysis of some indicators of the the search process, like for instance population diversity or well-known measures of problem hardness such as fitness distance correlation, more accurate. In this paper, we introduce a distance measure bound to one point standard crossover for genetic algorithms. This measure quantifies the minimum number of crossover operations that have to be applied to a population to tranform it into another population. It is based on the definition of a lattice over some particular schemata that represent the individuals in the population and on the construction of a discrete dynamic system that models the dynamics of the genetic algorithm under the sole effect of crossover. Using this distance measure, it is also possible to build a family of distances between individuals.|Luca Manzoni,Leonardo Vanneschi,Giancarlo Mauri",

The original ET approach focuses on searching for a high coverage of the test object by generating separate inputs for single function calls. We have identified a large set of real world application for which this approach does not perform well because only sequential calls of the tested function can reach a high structural coverage (white box test) or can check functional behavior (black box tests). Especially, control software which is responsible for controlling and constraining a system cannot be tested successfully with ET. Such software is characterized by storing internal data during a sequence of calls. In this paper we present the Evolutionary Sequence Testing approach for white box and black box tests. For automatic sequence testing, a fitness function for the application of ET will be introduced, which allows the optimization of input sequences that reach a high coverage of the software under test.

In this process test case generation plays a crucial role, defining appropriate and error-sensitive test data. The evolutionary white-box testing is a promising approach for the complete automation of structure-oriented test case generation. Here, test case generation can be completely automated with the help of evolutionary algorithms. However, problem cases exist in which the evolutionary test is not able to find valid test data. Thus, in the case of not achieving a test goal, it is not known whether this is due to non-executable program code or a problem case. This paper will investigate how successfully a software measure can support an evolutionary white-box test if the measure can predict the test effort. Hence, the termination criteria of evolutionary white-box testing can be adapted to test goals with problem cases in such a way that problematic test goals are either excluded from the test in advance or can be covered due to an adequate termination criteria according to a software measure. This could lead to an increase in efficiency and effectiveness of evolutionary white-box testing.|Frank Lammermann,Stefan Wappler",

Not only approaches that search for numeric test data for procedural test objects have been investigated, but also techniques for automatically generating test programs that represent object-oriented unit test cases. Compared to numeric test data, test programs optimized for object-oriented unit testing are more complex. Method call sequences that realize interesting test scenarios must be evolved. An arbitrary method call sequence is not necessarily feasible due to call dependences which exist among the methods that potentially appear in a method call sequence. The approach presented in this paper relies on a tree-based representation of method call sequences by which sequence feasibility is preserved throughout the entire search process. In contrast to other approaches in this area, neither repair of individuals nor penalty mechanisms are required. Strongly-typed genetic programming is employed to generate method call trees. In order to deal with runtime exceptions, we use an extended distance-based fitness function. We performed experiments with four test objects.

Experiments were conducted with EANNs that updated connection weights through genetic operators (crossover and mutation) andor with the aid of back-propagation. The results showed that the optimal performance was achieved under natural complexification of the EANN and that back-propagation tended to over fit the data.

Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict.

However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method. In addition to that, the threshold ai is also evolved by mutation between i - aisi, i + aisi in every generation in order to obtain as many association rules as possible. The features of the proposed method are as follows compared with other methods ) Extracts rules without identifying frequent itemsets used in Apriori-like mining methods. ) Stores extracted important association rules in a pool all together through generations. ) Measures the significance of associations via the chi-squared test. ) Extracts important rules sufficient enough for user's purpose in a short time. ) The pool is updated in every generation and only important association rules with higher chi-squared value are stored when the identical rules are stored. We have evaluated the proposed method by doing two simulations. Simulation  uses fixed threshold values that is, they remain fixed at initial thresholds during evolution. In simulation ,thresholds are evolved by mutation in every generation. Fig.  shows the number of rules extracted in the pool in simulation .

The main characteristic feature of the EMO approach is that no a priori information about the decision maker's preference is assumed. The EMO approach tries to find well-distributed trade-off solutions with a wide range of objective values as many as possible. A final solution is supposed to be chosen from the obtained trade-off solutions by the decision maker. On the other hand, the reference solution-based approach utilizes the information about the decision maker's preference in the form of a reference solution. We examine whether the EMO approach can find good trade-off solutions close to an arbitrarily given reference solution. Experimental results show that good solutions are not always obtained by the EMO approach. We also examine where the reference solution-based approach can find many trade-off solutions around the given reference solution. Experimental results show that many trade-off solutions can not be obtained even when an archive population of non-dominated solutions is stored in the reference solution-based approach. Based on these observations, we suggest a hybrid approach.|Hisao Ishibuchi,Kaname Narukawa",

The proposed optimization system, consisting of technical analysis rules, are trained to generate trading advice. The experimental results on the Japanese stock market show that the proposed optimization system using GNP with control nodes outperforms other traditional models and Buy&Hold method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, and its effectiveness has been confirmed.|Yan Chen,Shingo Mabu,Kaoru Shimada,Kotaro Hirasawa",

The robustness and symbolicinterpretative qualities of the genetic programming are employed to construct classification trees via Darwinian evolution. The flexible formal structure of the context-free grammar replaces the standard genetic programming representation and describes a language which encodes trees of varying complexity.

We present an implementation of this approach to develop randomised local search heuristics for constraint satisfaction problems, combining research on incremental evolution with local search heuristics evolution. A population of local search heuristics is evolved using a genetic programming framework on a simple problem for a short period and is then allowed to evolve on a more complex problem. Experiments compare the performance of this population with that of a randomly initialised population evolving directly on the more complex problem. The results obtained show that incremental evolution can represent a significant improvement in terms of optimisation speed, solution quality and solution structure.|Dara Curran,Eugene C.

        "57684|GECCO|2006|Dynamic multi-objective optimization with evolutionary algorithms a forward-looking approach|This work describes a forward-looking approach for the solution of dynamic (time-changing) problems using evolutionary algorithms. The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems. Initial results indicate that the approach improves algorithm performance, especially in problems where the frequency of objective change is high.|Iason Hatzakis,David Wallace",

The winner in this comparative study was the SVM. However, our results indicated that the spread of solutions achieved by our surrogate-based MOEA was poor. Thus, we decided to introduce a second phase to the algorithm in which it is hybridized with the rough sets in order to improve the spread of solutions and help to reach the true Pareto front.

In contrast to the single-objective case, diversity can be introduced by the multi-objective view of the algorithm and the dynamic use of objectives. Using the travelling salesman problem as an example we illustrate that two basic approaches, a) the addition of new objectives to the existing problem and b) the decomposition of the primary objective into sub-objectives, can improve performance compared to a single-objective genetic algorithm when objectives are used dynamically. Based on decomposition we propose the concept \"Multi-Objectivization via Segmentation\" (MOS), at which the original problem is reassembled.

Although there are advantages of knowing the range of each objective for Pareto-optimality and the shape of the Pareto-optimal frontier itself in a problem for an adequate decision-making, the task of choosing a single preferred Pareto-optimal solution is also an important task which has received a lukewarm attention so far. In this paper, we combine one such preference based strategy with an EMO methodology and demonstrate how, instead of one solution, a preferred set solutions near the reference points can be found parallely. We propose a modified EMO procedure based on the elitist non-dominated sorting GAor NSGA-II. On two-objective to -objective optimization problems, the modified NSGA-II approach shows its efficacy in finding an adequate set of Pareto-optimal points. Such procedures will provide the decision-maker with a set of solutions near herhis preference so that a better and a more reliable decision can be made.|Kalyanmoy Deb,J. Sundar",

A global (execution wise) evidence accumulation process inspired by recursive Bayesian estimation decides when the optimization should be stopped. Evidence is collected using a novel relative improvement measure constructed on top of the Pareto dominance relations. The evidence gathered after each iteration is accumulated and updated following a rule based on a simplified version of a discrete Kalman filter.Our criterion is particularly useful in complex andor high-dimensional problems where the traditional procedure of stopping after a predefined amount of iterations cannot beused and the waste of computational resources can induceto a detriment of the quality of the results.Although the criterion discussed here is meant for MOEAs,it can be easily adapted to other soft computing or numerical methods by substituting the local improvement metric witha suitable one.|Luis Mart\u00ed,Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda,Antonio Berlanga,Jos\u00e9 Manuel Molina",

Their major advantage lies in the fact that they are relatively simple to implement while they allow generalizations for a wide range of real world problems. The multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP), which belongs to the class of NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, is one of the variations of the knapsack problem. The MKP has a wide range of real world applications such as cargo loading, selecting projects to fund, budget management, cutting stock, etc. The MKP has been studied quite extensively in the EA community. Due to the constrained nature of the problem, constraint handling techniques gain great importance in the performance of the proposed EA approaches. In this study, the applicability of a generational EA that uses a penalty-based constraint handling technique and a gene locus based, asymmetric, adaptive mutation scheme is explored for the MKP. The effects of the parameters of the explored approach is determined through tests. Further experiments, using large MKP instances from commonly used benchmarks available through the Internet are performed. Comparison tables are given for the performance of the explored approach and other good performing EAs found in literature for the MKP. Results show that performance improves greatly when compared with other penalty-based techniques, but the explored approach is still not the best performer among all. However, unlike the explored technique, the EAs using the other constraint handling techniques require a great amount of extra computational effort and need heuristic information specific to the optimization problem. Based on these observations, and the fact that the performance difference between the explored scheme and the better performers is not too high, research on improving the explored approach is still in progress.|Sima Uyar,G\u00fclsen Eryigit",

Node-depth encoding applies specific search operators that is a typical characteristic for direct encodings. An investigation into the bias of the initialization process and the mutation operators of the node-depth encoding shows that the initialization process has a bias to solutions with small depths and diameters, and a bias towards stars. This investigation, also, shows that the mutation operators are unbiased. The performance of node-depth encoding is investigated for the bounded-diameter minimum spanning tree problem. The results are presented for Euclidean instances presented in the literature. In contrast with the expectation, the evolutionary algorithm using the biased initialization operator does not allow evolutionary algorithms to find better solutions compared to an unbiased initialization.

Very little work, however, has been done on producing heuristics for BDMSTs using evolutionary algorithms. In this paper we have used multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) to explore the evolution of a set of heuristics for the BDMST problem. The quality of the Pareto fronts obtained from the MOGP-evolved heuristics is comparable to, or in some cases better than, the Pareto fronts generated by established, hand-crafted heuristics.

However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method. In addition to that, the threshold ai is also evolved by mutation between i - aisi, i + aisi in every generation in order to obtain as many association rules as possible. The features of the proposed method are as follows compared with other methods ) Extracts rules without identifying frequent itemsets used in Apriori-like mining methods. ) Stores extracted important association rules in a pool all together through generations. ) Measures the significance of associations via the chi-squared test. ) Extracts important rules sufficient enough for user's purpose in a short time. ) The pool is updated in every generation and only important association rules with higher chi-squared value are stored when the identical rules are stored. We have evaluated the proposed method by doing two simulations. Simulation  uses fixed threshold values that is, they remain fixed at initial thresholds during evolution. In simulation ,thresholds are evolved by mutation in every generation. Fig.  shows the number of rules extracted in the pool in simulation .

In this paper, GNP is applied to creating a stock trading model. There are three important points The first important point is to combine GNP with Sarsa Learning which is one of the reinforcement learning algorithms. Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation.

But no studies have analyzed the behavior of the algorithm in detail for time series forecasting, nor used ensembles to try to improve the predictions. Thus, the aim of this work is to compare the ensemble approach, using two linear combination methods to calculate the output, against the best individual found. Since there are several parameters to adjust, experiments are set up to optimize them and improve the performance of the algorithm. The algorithm is tested on  time series of different behaviors. The experimental results show that, for time series forecasting, it is possible to improve the performance by using the ensemble method rather than using the best individual.

In biological populations, i.e. animals, even human beings and microorganisms, social interactions often affect the fitness of individuals. It is conceivable that the perturbation of the fitness via social interactions is an evolutionary strategy to avoid trapping into local optimum, thus avoiding a fast convergence of the population. We model the social interactions according to Game Theory. The population is, therefore, composed by cooperator and defector individuals whose interactions produce payoffs according to well known game models (prisoner's dilemma, chicken game, and others).

This is in contrast to existing teaming approaches where individuals learn a direct input-output map (e.g., from exemplars to class labels), allowing the approach to scale to problems with multiple outcomes (classes), while at the same time providing a mechanism for choosing an outcome from those suggested by team members. This paper proposes a symbiotic relationship that continues to support the cooperative bid-based process for problem decomposition while making the credit assignment process much clearer. Specifically, team membership is defined by a team population indexing combinations of GP individuals in a separate team member population. A Pareto-based competitive coevolutionary component enables the approach to scale to large problems by evolving informative test points in a third population. The ensuing Symbiotic Bid-Based (SBB) model is evaluated on three large classification problems and compared to the XCS learning classifier system (LCS) formulation and to the support vector machine (SVM) implementation LIBSVM. On two of the three problems investigated the overall accuracy of the SBB classifiers was found to be competitive with the XCS and SVM results. At the same time, on all problems, the SBB classifiers were able to detect instances of all classes whereas the XCS and SVM models often ignored exemplars of minor classes.

Traditional mask-based crossover operators for binary strings (e.g., one-point and uniform) tend to decrease the diversity of solutions in EMO algorithms while they improve the convergence to the Pareto front. This is because such a crossover operator, which is called geometric crossover, always generates an offspring in the segment between its two parents under the Hamming distance in the genotype space. That is, the sum of the distances from the generated offspring to its two parents is always equal to the distance between the parents. In this paper, first we propose a non-geometric binary crossover operator to generate an offspring outside the segment between its parents. Next we examine the effect of the use of non-geometric binary crossover on single-objective genetic algorithms. Experimental results show that non-geometric binary crossover improves their search ability. Then we examine its effect on EMO algorithms. Experimental results show that non-geometric binary crossover drastically increases the diversity of solutions while it slightly degrades their convergence to the Pareto front.

Another strategy is to remove overlapping solutions so that each solution in the current population has a different location in the decision space.

The results show that multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are suitable for this problem, and illustrates the way in which a Pareto optimal search can yield insights into the trade-offs between the two simultaneous objectives.|Kiran Lakhotia,Mark Harman,Phil McMinn",

In the field of genetic programming, a number of decomposition and reuse techniques have been devised to address this. As an alternative to the more commonly employed encapsulation methods, we propose an approach based on the division of test input cases into subsets, each dealt with by an independently evolved code segment. Two program architectures are suggested for this hierarchical approach, and experimentation demonstrates that they offer substantial performance improvements over more established methods.

Since evolutionary algorithms are heuristics, their performance and output efficiency can vary across multiple runs. Therefore, there is a strong need to empirically investigate the capacity of evolutionary test techniques to achieve the desired objectives (e.g., generate stress test cases) and their scalability in terms of the complexity of the System Under Test (SUT), the inputs, and the control parameters of the search algorithms. In a previous work, we presented a GA-based UML-driven, stress test technique aimed at increasing chances of discovering faults related to network traffic in distributed real-time software. This paper reports a carefully-designed empirical study which was conducted to analyze and improve the applicability, efficiency and effectiveness of the above GA-based stress test technique. Detailed stages and objectives of the empirical analysis are reported. The findings of the study are furthermore used to better calibrate the parameters of the GA-based stress test technique.|Vahid Garousi",

The use of synthetic DNA molecules combined with biochemical techniques for variation and selection allows for various possibilities for building novel evolvable hardware. Also, the possibility of maintaining a huge number of individuals and their massively parallel manipulation allows us to make robust decisions by the \"molecular\" genetic programs evolved within a single population. We evaluate the potentials of this \"molecular programming\" approach by solving a medical diagnosis problem on a simulated DNA computer. Here the individual genetic program represents a decision list of variable length and the whole population takes part in making probabilistic decisions. Tested on a real-life leukemia diagnosis data, the evolved molecular genetic programs showed a comparable performance to decision trees.

The most important parameter is the maximal age of search points. Considering static pure aging known from artificial immune systems in the context of simple evolutionary algorithms, it is demonstrated that the choice of this parameter is both, crucial for the performance and difficult to set appropriately. The results are derived in a rigorous fashion and given as theorems with formal proofs. An additional contribution is the presentation of a general method to combine fitness functions into a function with stronger properties than its components. By application of this method we combine a function where the maximal age needs to be sufficiently large with a function where the maximal age needs to be sufficiently small. This yields a function where an appropriate age lies within a very narrow range.|Christian Horoba,Thomas Jansen,Christine Zarges",

The maximum matching problem is well suited for this approach since long augmenting paths do not allow immediate improvements by local changes. It is known that randomized search heuristics like simulated annealing, the Metropolis algorithm, the (+) EA and randomized local search efficiently approximate maximum matchings for any graph however, there are graphs where they fail to find maximum matchings in polynomial time.

For unimodal -D and separable multi-dimensional functions, the result is the global optimum. We empirically assess the performance of steepest ascent local search, next ascent local search, and Quad Search. These algorithms are also compared with Evolutionary Strategies.

The agents are controlled by a new kind of computational network based on a compartmentalised model of neurons. We have taken the view that the genetic basis of neurons is an important  and neglected aspect of previous approaches. Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents.

GNP is an evolutionary computation, which represents its solutions using graph structures and has some useful features inherently. It has been clarified that GNP works well especially in dynamic environments since GNP can create quite compact programs and has an implicit memory function. In this paper, GNP is applied to creating a stock trading model. There are three important points The first important point is to combine GNP with Sarsa Learning which is one of the reinforcement learning algorithms. Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of  brands in ,  and . Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in . From the simulation results, it is clarified that the trading rules of the proposed method obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method and its effectiveness has been confirmed.|Yan Chen,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu",

We rely on module definition that is most natural for GP a piece of program code (subtree). However, as opposed to syntax-based approaches that abstract from the actual computation performed by a module, we analyze also its semantic using a set of fitness cases. In particular, the central notion of this approach is subgoal, an entity that embodies module's desired semantic and is used to evaluate module candidates. As the cardinality of the space of all subgoals is exponential with respect to the number of fitness cases, we introduce monotonicity to assess subgoals' potential utility for searching for good modules. For a given subgoal and a sample of modules, monotonicity measures the correlation of subgoal's distance from module's semantics and the fitness of the solution the module is part of. In the experimental part we demonstrate how these concepts may be used to describe and quantify the modularity of two simple problems of Boolean function synthesis. In particular, we conclude that monotonicity usefully differentiates two problems with different nature of modularity, allows us to tell apart the useful subgoals from the other ones, and may be potentially used for problem decomposition and enhance the efficiency of evolutionary search.|Krzysztof Krawiec,Bartosz Wieloch",

The approach we have taken is to evolve a computer program that controls a writing-head, which moves along and interacts with a finite set of symbols that are interpreted as real numbers, instead of manipulating the real numbers directly. In other studies, CGP has already been shown to benefit from a high degree of neutrality. We hope to exploit this for real-valued function optimisation problems to avoid being trapped on local optima.

To explore multiple efficient drug scheduling policies, we use a multimodal optimization algorithm --- adaptive elitist-population based genetic algorithm (AEGA) to solve the new model, and discuss the situation of multiple optimal solutions under different parameter settings. The simulation results obtained by the new model match well with the clinical treatment experience, and can provide much more drug scheduling policies for a doctor to choose depending on the particular conditions of the patients.|Yong Liang,Kwong-Sak Leung,Tony Shu Kam Mok",

Our approach simultaneously explores the architecture, the mapping and the scheduling of the system, by using multi-objective evolution. In particular, we considered three approaches a multi-objective genetic algorithm, multi-objective Simulated Annealing, and multi-objective Tabu Search. The algorithms search for optimal architectures, in terms of processing elements (processors and hardware accelerators) and communication infrastructure, and for the best mappings and schedules of multi-rate real-time applications given objectives such as system area, hard and soft dead-lines violations, dimensions of memory buffers. We formalize the problem, describe our flow and compare the three algorithms, dis- cussing which one performs better with respect to different classes of applications.|Marco Ceriani,Fabrizio Ferrandi,Pier Luca Lanzi,Donatella Sciuto,Antonino Tumeo",
        "58193|GECCO|2007|An evolutionary approach to collective communication scheduling|In this paper, we describe two evolutionary algorithms aimed at scheduling collective communications on interconnection networks of parallel computers. To avoid contention for links and associated delays, collective communications proceed in synchronized steps. Minimum number of steps is sought for the given network topology, wormhole (pipelined) switching, minimum routing and given sets of sender andor receiver nodes. Used algorithms are able not only re-invent optimum schedules for known symmetric topologies like hyper-cubes, but they can find schedules even for any asymmetric or irregular topologies in case of general many-to-many collective communications. In most cases does the number of steps reach the theoretical lower bound for the given type of collective communication if it does not, non-minimum routing can provide further improvement. Optimum schedules may serve for writing high-performance communication routines for application-specific networks on chip or for development of communication libraries in case of general-purpose interconnection networ.|Jir\u00ed Jaros,Milos Ohl\u00eddal,Vaclav Dvorak",

Locally, Simplex is extended for the JSP linear program to reduce the number of infeasible solutions while solution quality is improved with an operation order search. Globally, a niche-based evolutionary strategy is employed to gain parallelization while solution diversity is maintained in two ways composite dispatching rule-based population initialization and memory-based machine assignment. Performance results on benchmark problems show that ALPINE outperforms existing hybrid techniques with a new global optima found for the x Flexible Job Shop Problem.|Syhlin Kuah,Joc Cing Tay",
        "57460|GECCO|2005|A comparison of evolutionary algorithms for system-level diagnosis|The size and complexity of systems based on multiple processing units demand techniques for the automatic diagnosis of their state. System-level diagnosis consists in determining which units of a system are faulty and which are fault-free. Elhadef and Ayeb have proposed a specialized genetic algorithm (GA) that can be used to accomplish diagnosis. This work extends their approach, describing and comparing several evolutionary algorithms for system-level diagnosis. Implemented algorithms include a simple genetic algorithm, a specialized GA both with and without crossover and specialized versions of the compact GA and Population-Based Incremental Learning both with and without negative examples. These algorithms had their performance evaluated using four metrics the average number of generations needed to find the solution, the average fitness after up to  generations, the percentage of tests that found the optimal solution and the average time until the solution was found. An analysis of experimental results shows that more sophisticated algorithms converge faster to the optimal solution.|Bogdan Tomoyuki Nassu,Elias Proc\u00f3pio Duarte Jr.,Aurora Trinidad Ramirez Pozo",

Accordingly, an unbalanced search can lead to premature convergence. GASOM, a novel Genetic Algorithm, addresses this problem by intelligent exploration techniques. The approach uses Self-Organizing Maps to mine data from the evolution process. The information obtained is successfully utilized to enhance the search strategy and confront genetic drift. This way, local optima are avoided and exploratory power is maintained. The evaluation of GASOM on well known problems shows that it effectively prevents premature convergence and seeks the global optimum. Particularly on deceptive and misleading functions it showed outstanding performance. Additionally, representing the search history by the Self-Organizing Map provides a visually pleasing insight into the state and course of evolution.|Heni Ben Amor,Achim Rettinger",

A binary semi-genetic algorithm is introduced, and it is proved that in a certain sense any reasonable evolutionary search algorithm can be re-encoded by a binary semi-genetic algorithm (see corollaries  and ). Moreover, an explicit bijection between the set of all such re-encodings and the collection of certain n-tuples of invariant subsets is constructed (see theorem ). Finally, all possible re-encodings of a given heuristic search algorithm by a classical genetic algorithm are entirely classified in terms of invariant subsets of the search space in connection with Radcliffe's forma (see  and theorem ).|Boris Mitavskiy"

        "57029|GECCO|2003|Structural and Functional Sequence Test of Dynamic and State-Based Software with Evolutionary Algorithms|Evolutionary Testing (ET) has been shown to be very successful for testing real world applications . The original ET approach focuses on searching for a high coverage of the test object by generating separate inputs for single function calls. We have identified a large set of real world application for which this approach does not perform well because only sequential calls of the tested function can reach a high structural coverage (white box test) or can check functional behavior (black box tests). Especially, control software which is responsible for controlling and constraining a system cannot be tested successfully with ET. Such software is characterized by storing internal data during a sequence of calls. In this paper we present the Evolutionary Sequence Testing approach for white box and black box tests. For automatic sequence testing, a fitness function for the application of ET will be introduced, which allows the optimization of input sequences that reach a high coverage of the software under test. The authors also present a new compact description for the generation of real-world input sequences for functional testing. A set of objective functions to evaluate the test output of systems under test have been developed. These approaches are currently used for the structural and safety testing of car control systems.|Andr\u00e9 Baresel,Hartmut Pohlheim,Sadegh Sadeghipour",
        "59056|GECCO|2010|Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for dynamic social network clustering|The main focus of this paper is to propose integration of dynamic and multiobjective algorithms for graph clustering in dynamic environments under multiple objectives. The primary application is to multiobjective clustering in social networks which change over time. Social networks, typically represented by graphs, contain information about the relations (or interactions) among online materials (or people). A typical social network tends to expand over time, with newly added nodes and edges being incorporated into the existing graph. We reflect these characteristics of social networks based on real-world data, and propose a suitable dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Several variants of the algorithm are proposed and compared. Since social networks change continuously, the immigrant schemes effectively used in previous dynamic optimisation give useful ideas for new algorithms. An adaptive integration of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms outperformed other algorithms in dynamic social networks.|Keehyung Kim,R. I. (Bob) McKay,Byung Ro Moon",
        "58624|GECCO|2009|Improving prediction in evolutionary algorithms for dynamic environments|The addition of prediction mechanisms in Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) applied to dynamic environments is essential in order to anticipate the changes in the landscape and maximize its adaptability. In previous work, a combination of a linear regression predictor and a Markov chain model was used to enable the EA to estimate when next change will occur and to predict the direction of the change. Knowing when and how the change will occur, the anticipation of the change was made introducing useful information before it happens. In this paper we introduce mechanisms to dynamically adjust the linear predictor in order to achieve higher adaptability and robustness. We also extend previous studies introducing nonlinear change periods in order to evaluate the predictor's accuracy.|Anabela Sim\u00f5es,Ernesto Costa",
        "58500|GECCO|2008|Adaptive operator selection with dynamic multi-armed bandits|An important step toward self-tuning Evolutionary Algorithms is to design efficient Adaptive Operator Selection procedures. Such a procedure is made of two main components a credit assignment mechanism, that computes a reward for each operator at hand based on some characteristics of the past offspring and an adaptation rule, that modifies the selection mechanism based on the rewards of the different operators. This paper is concerned with the latter, and proposes a new approach for it based on the well-known Multi-Armed Bandit paradigm. However, because the basic Multi-Armed Bandit methods have been developed for static frameworks, a specific Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm is proposed, that hybridizes an optimal Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm with the statistical Page-Hinkley test, which enforces the efficient detection of changes in time series. This original Operator Selection procedure is then compared to the state-of-the-art rules known as Probability Matching and Adaptive Pursuit on several artificial scenarios, after a careful sensitivity analysis of all methods. The Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit method is found to outperform the other methods on a scenario from the literature, while on another scenario, the basic Multi-Armed Bandit performs best.|Lu\u00eds Da Costa,\u00fflvaro Fialho,Marc Schoenauer,Mich\u00e8le Sebag",
        "58881|GECCO|2010|Selection pressure and takeover time of distributed evolutionary algorithms|This paper presents a theoretical study about the selection pressure and the convergence speed of distributed evolutionary algorithms (dEA). In concrete, we model the best individual's growth curve and the takeover time for usual models of multipopulation EAs found in the literature. The calculation of the takeover time is a common analytical approach to measure the selection pressure of an EA. This work is another step forward to mathematically unify and describe the roles of all the parameters of the migration policy (the migration rate, the migration period, the topology, and the selectionreplace schemes of immigrants) in the selection pressure induced by the dynamics of dEAs. In order to achieve these goals we analyze the behaviour of these algorithms and propose a mathematical formula which models that dynamic. The proposed mathematical model is later verified in practice.|Gabriel Luque,Enrique Alba",

        "57939|GECCO|2007|Peer-to-peer evolutionary algorithms with adaptive autonomous selection|In this paper we describe and evaluate a fully distributed PP evolutionary algorithm (EA) with adaptive autonomous selection. Autonomous selection means that decisions regarding survival and reproduction are taken by the individuals themselves independently, without any central control.This allows for a fully distributed EA, where not only reproduction (crossover and mutation) but also selection is performed at local level. An unwanted consequence of adding and removing individuals in a non-synchronized manner is that the population size gets out of control too. This problem is resolved by addingan adaptation mechanism allowing individuals to regulate their own selection pressure. The key tothis is a gossiping algorithm that enables individuals to maintain estimates on the size andthe fitness of the population. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated on a test problem to show the viability of the idea and to gain insight into the run-time dynamics of such an algorithm. The results convincingly demonstrate the feasibility of a fully decentralized EA in which the population size can be kept stable.|W. R. M. U. K. Wickramasinghe,Maarten van Steen,A. E. Eiben",

When using EAs to solve DE problems, we are usually interested in the algorithm's ability to adapt and recover from the changes. One of the main problems facing an evolutionary method when solving DE problems is the loss of genetic diversity.In this paper, we investigate the use of evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods (EMOs) for single-objective DE problems. For that purpose, we introduce an artificial second objective with the aim to maintain useful diversity in the population. Six different artificial objectives are examined and compared.All the results will be compared against a traditional GA and the random immigrants algorithm.

This work is motivated by the search for a general model for asynchronous update of the individuals in a cellular EA, and by the necessity of better accuracy beyond what existing models of selection intensity can provide. Therefore, we investigate the differences between the expected and actual values of the selection pressure induced by several asynchronous update policies, and formally characterize the update dynamics of each variant of the algorithm. New models for these two issues are proposed, and are shown to be more accurate (lower fit error) than previous ones.|Mario Giacobini,Enrique Alba,Marco Tomassini"
