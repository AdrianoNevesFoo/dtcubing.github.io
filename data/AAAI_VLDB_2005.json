Although support vector machines (SVMs) have been a dominant machine learning technique for the past decade, they have generally been applied to supervised learning problems. Developing unsupervised extensions to SVMs has in fact proved to be difficult. In this paper, we present a principled approach to unsupervised SVM training by formulating convex relaxations of the natural training criterion find a labeling that would yield an optimal SVM classifier on the resulting training data. The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well. While previous work has concentrated on the two-class case, we present a general, multi-class formulation that can be applied to a wider range of natural data sets. The resulting training procedures are computationally intensive, but produce high quality generalization results.|Linli Xu,Dale Schuurmans","65537|AAAI|2005|Word Sense Disambiguation with Semi-Supervised Learning|Current word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning are still limited in that they do not work well for all words in a language.

These domains require on-line learning methods without the benefit of repeated training examples, as well as the ability to adapt to the evolving behavior of other agents in the environment. The difficulty is further exacerbated when the agents are in an adversarial relationship, demanding that a robust (i.e. winning) non-stationary policy be rapidly learned and adapted. We propose an on-line sequence learning algorithm, ELPH, based on a straightforward entropy pruning technique that is able to rapidly learn and adapt to non-stationary policies. We demonstrate the performance of this method in a non-stationary learning environment of adversarial zero-sum matrix games.|Steven Jensen,Daniel Boley,Maria L. Gini,Paul R.

RL is applied to an online resource allocation task in a distributed multi-application computing environment with independent time-varying load in each application. The task is to allocate servers in real time so as to maximize the sum of performance-based expected utility in each application. This task may be treated as a composite MDP, and to exploit the problem structure, a simple localized RL approach is proposed, with better scalability than previous approaches. The RL approach is tested in a realistic prototype data center comprising real servers, real HTTP requests, and realistic time-varying demand. This domain poses a number of major challenges associated with live training in a real system, including the need for rapid training, exploration that avoids excessive penalties, and handling complex, potentially non-Markovian system effects.

An SLDS has significantly more descriptive power than an HMM, but inference in SLDS models is computationally intractable. This paper describes a novel inference algorithm for SLDS models based on the Data-Driven MCMC paradigm. We describe a new proposal distribution which substantially increases the convergence speed. Comparisons to standard deterministic approximation methods demonstrate the improved accuracy of our new approach. We apply our approach to the problem of learning an SLDS model of the bee dance. Honeybees communicate the location and distance to food sources through a dance that takes place within the hive. We learn SLDS model parameters from tracking data which is automatically extracted from video. We then demonstrate the ability to successfully segment novel bee dances into their constituent parts, effectively decoding the dance of the bees.|Sang Min Oh,James M. Rehg,Tucker R.

This has rendered statistical software testing and machine learning techniques increasingly attractive. Drawing from both of these, we present an active learning framework for blackbox software testing. The active learning approach samples inputoutput pairs from a blackbox and learns a model of the system's behaviour. This model is then used to select new inputs for sampling. This framework has been developed in the context of commercial video games, complex virtual worlds with high-dimensional state spaces, too large for exhaustive testing. Beyond its correctness, developers need to evaluate the gameplay of a game, properties such as difficulty. We use the learned model not only to guide sampling but also to summarize the game's behaviour for the developer to evaluate.

Our new method extends a recent advice-giving technique, called Knowledge-Based Kernel Regression (KBKR), that accepts advice concerning a single action of a reinforcement learner. In KBKR, users can say that in some set of states, an action's value should be greater than some linear expression of the current state. In our new technique, which we call Preference KBKR (Pref-KBKR), the user can provide advice in a more natural manner by recommending that some action is preferred over another in the specified set of states. Specifying preferences essentially means that users are giving advice about policies rather than Q values, which is a more natural way for humans to present advice. We present the motivation for preference advice and a proof of the correctness of our extension to KBKR. In addition, we show empirical results that our method can make effective use of advice on a novel reinforcement-learning task, based on the RoboCup simulator, which we call Breakaway. Our work demonstrates the significant potential of advice-giving techniques for addressing complex reinforcement learning problems, while further demonstrating the use of support-vector regression for reinforcement learning.|Richard Maclin,Jude W.

It requires the learning algorithms themselves to be in equilibrium for any game selected from a set of (initially unknown) games. In an optimal ELE, the learning algorithms would efficiently obtain the surplus the agents would obtain in an optimal Nash equilibrium of the initially unknown game which is played. The crucial part is that in an ELE deviations from the learning algorithms would become nonbeneficial after polynomial time, although the game played is initially unknown. While appealing conceptually, the main challenge for establishing learning algorithms based on this concept is to isolate general classes of games where an ELE exists. Unfortunately, it has been shown that while an ELE exists for the setting in which each agent can observe all other agents' actions and payoffs, an ELE does not exist in general when the other agents' payoffs cannot be observed. In this paper we provide the first positive results on this problem, constructively proving the existence of an optimal ELE for the class of symmetric games where an agent can not observe other agents' payoffs.|Ronen I.

The upcoming release of Microsoft's SQL Server supports XQuery as the query language over such XML data using its relational infrastructure.XQuery is an emerging WC recommendation for querying XML data. It provides a set of language constructs (FLWOR), the ability to dynamically shape the query result, and a large set of functions and operators.

The query tree is optimized using relational optimization techniques, such as cost-based decisions, and rewrite rules based on XML schemas.

These systems need to have an explicit temporal data model for RFID data to support tracking and monitoring queries. In addition, they need to have an automatic method to transform the primitive observations from RFID readers into derived data used in RFID-enabled applications.

We present an extensible stream database system that allows scalable and flexible continuous queries on such streams. Application dependent streams and query functions are defined through an object-relational model. Distributed execution plans for continuous queries are described as high-level data flow distribution templates. Using a generic template we define two partitioning strategies for scalable parallel execution of expensive stream queries window split and window distribute. Window split provides operators for parallel execution of query functions by reducing the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluate these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that window split is favorable when expensive queries are executed on limited resources, while window distribution is better otherwise.|Milena Ivanova,Tore Risch","80485|VLDB|2005|Efficient Evaluation of XQuery over Streaming Data|With the growing popularity of XML and emergence of streaming data model, processing queries over streaming XML has become an important topic.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

Previous techniques have been inadequate, because they have focused mainly on the tag-labeled paths (tree structure) of the XML data. For most real XML data, the number of distinct string values at the leaf nodes is orders of magnitude larger than the set of distinct rooted tag paths. Hence, the real challenge lies in accurate selectivity estimation of the string predicates on the leaf values reachable via a given path.In this paper, we present CXHist, a novel workload-aware histogram technique that provides accurate selectivity estimation on a broad class of XML string-based queries. CXHist builds a histogram in an on-line manner by grouping queries into buckets using their true selectivity obtained from query feedback. The set of queries associated with each bucket is summarized into feature distributions. These feature distributions mimic a Bayesian classifier that is used to route a query to its associated bucket during selectivity estimation. We show how CXHist can be used for two general types of path, string queries exact match queries and substring match queries. Experiments using a prototype show that CXHist provides accurate selectivity estimation for both exact match queries and substring match queries.|Lipyeow Lim,Min Wang,Jeffrey Scott Vitter"],["65429|AAAI|2005|Fast Planning in Domains with Derived Predicates An Approach Based on Rule-Action Graphs and Local Search|The ability to express \"derived predicates\" in the formalization of a planning domain is both practically and theoretically important.

We use the notion of complete multi-class symmetry and demonstrate the efficacy of our technique through a solver SymChaff that achieves exponential speedup by using simple tags in the specification of problems from both theory and practice. Efficient implementations of DPLL-based SAT solvers are routinely used in areas as diverse as planning, scheduling, design automation, model checking, verification, testing, and algebra. A natural feature of many application domains is the presence of symmetry, such as that amongst all trucks at a certain location in logistics planning and all wires connecting two switch boxes in an FPGA circuit. Many of these problems turn out to have a concise description in many-sorted first order logic. This description can be easily specified by the problem designer and almost as easily inferred automatically. SymChaff, an extension of the popular SAT solver zChaff, uses information obtained from the \"sorts\" in the first order logic constraints to create symmetry sets that are used to partition variables into classes and to maintain and utilize symmetry information dynamically. Current approaches designed to handle symmetry include (A) symmetry breaking predicates (SBPs), (B) pseudo-Boolean solvers with implicit representation for counting, (C) modifications of DPLL that handle symmetry dynamically, and (D) techniques based on ZBDDs. SBPs are prohibitively many, often large, and expensive to compute for problems such as the ones we report experimental results for. Pseudo-Boolean solvers are provably exponentially slow in certain symmetric situations and their implicit counting representation is not always appropriate. Suggested modifications of DPLL either work on limited global symmetry and are difficult to extend, or involve expensive algebraic group computations. Finally, techniques based on ZBDDs often do not compare well even with ordinary DPLL-based solvers. Sym-Chaff addresses and overcomes most of these limitations.|Ashish Sabharwal","65426|AAAI|2005|Validating Plans in the Context of Processes and Exogenous Events|Complex planning domains push the boundaries of the expressive power of planning domain modelling languages.

Two useful heuristics are the hm heuristics, which generalize the reachability heuristic underlying the planning graph, and pattern database heuristics. These heuristics, however, have serious limitations reachability heuristics capture only the cost of critical paths in a relaxed problem, ignoring the cost of other relevant paths, while PDB heuristics, additive or not, cannot accommodate too many variables in patterns, and methods for automatically selecting patterns that produce good estimates are not known. We introduce two refinements of these heuristics First, the additive hm heuristic which yields an admissible sum of hm heuristics using a partitioning of the set of actions. Second, the constrained PDB heuristic which uses constraints from the original problem to strengthen the lower bounds obtained from abstractions. The new heuristics depend on the way the actions or problem variables are partitioned. We advance methods for automatically deriving additive hm and PDB heuristics from STRIPS encodings. Evaluation shows improvement over existing heuristics in several domains, although, not surprisingly, no heuristic dominates all the others over all domains.|Patrik Haslum,Blai Bonet,Hector Geffner","65485|AAAI|2005|Risk-Sensitive Planning with One-Switch Utility Functions Value Iteration|Decision-theoretic planning with nonlinear utility functions is important since decision makers are often risk-sensitive in high-stake planning situations.

We study how to maximize the expected utility of a Markov decision problem for a given one-switch utility function, which is difficult since the resulting planning problem is not decomposable. We first study an approach that augments the states of the Markov decision problem with the wealth level. The properties of the resulting infinite Markov decision problem then allow us to generalize the standard risk-neutral version of value iteration from manipulating values to manipulating functions that map wealth levels to values.

Here we introduce a new representation for heuristics based on lists of set expressions described using taxonomic syntax. Next, we review the idea of a measure of progress (parmar ), which is any heuristic that is guaranteed to be improvable at every state. We take finding a measure of progress as our learning goal, and describe a simple learning algorithm for this purpose. We evaluate our approach across a range of deterministic and stochastic planning-competition domains. The results show that often greedily following the learned heuristic is highly effective.

A pervasive assumption has been that of no externalities the agents deciding on a variable (such as whether a trade takes place between them) are the only ones affected by how this variable is set. To date, there has been no widely studied formalization of combinatorial negotiation settings with externalities. In this paper, we introduce such a formalization. We show that in a number of key special cases, it is NP-complete to find a feasible nontrivial solution (and therefore the maximum social welfare is completely inapproximable). However, for one important special case, we give an algorithm which converges to the solution with the maximal concession by each agent (in a linear number of rounds for utility functions that decompose into piecewise constant functions). Maximizing social welfare, however, remains NP-complete even in this setting.

We illustrate mathematically that the degree of cooperativeness of an agent and the degree of its selfdirectness are not directly related. We also show how OAR can be used to evaluate different negotiation strategies and to develop distributed mechanisms that optimize the performance dynamically. This research demonstrates that sophisticated probabilistic modeling can be used to understand the behaviors of a system with complex agent interactions.|Jiaying Shen,Ingo Weber,Victor R.

This paper proposes two methods that enable the domain expert, who is nonexpert in artificial intelligence (AI), to interactively supervise the knowledge validation process in a CBR system, and to enable dynamic updating of the system, to provide the best diagnostic questions. The first method is based on formal concept analysis which involves a graphical representation and comparison of the concepts, and a summary description highlighting the conceptual differences. We propose a dissimilarity metric for measuring the degree of variation between the previous and current concepts when a new case is added to the knowledge base. The second method involves determining unexpected classification-based association rules to form critical questions as the knowledge base gets updated.|Monica H. Ou,Geoff A. W.

In order for coalitions to be stable, a key question that must be answered is how the gains from cooperation are to be distributed. Various solution concepts (such as the Shapley value, core, least core, and nucleolus) have been proposed. In this paper, we demonstrate how these concepts are vulnerable to various kinds of manipulations in open anonymous environments such as the Internet. These manipulations include submitting false names (one acting as many), collusion (many acting as one), and the hiding of skills. To address these threats, we introduce a new solution concept called the anonymity-proof core, which is robust to these manipulations. We show that the anonymity-proof core is characterized by certain simple axiomatic conditions. Furthermore, we show that by relaxing these conditions, we obtain a concept called the least anonymity-proof core, which is guaranteed to be non-empty. We also show that computational hardness of manipulation may provide an alternative barrier to manipulation.|Makoto Yokoo,Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm,Naoki Ohta,Atsushi Iwasaki","80523|VLDB|2005|Offline and Data Stream Algorithms for Efficient Computation of Synopsis Structures|Synopsis and small space representations are important data analysis tools and have long been used OLAPDSS systems, approximate query answering, query optimization and data mining.

In a recent past, the synopsis techniques have gained more currency due to the emerging areas like data stream management.In this tutorial, we propose to revisit algorithms for Wavelet and Histogram synopsis construction. In the recent years, a significant number of papers have appeared which has advanced the state-of-the-art in synopsis construction considerably. In particular, we have seen the development of a large number of efficient algorithms which are also guaranteed to be near optimal. Furthermore, these synopsis construction problems have found deep roots in theory and database systems, and have influenced a wide range of problems. In a different level, a large number of the synopsis construction algorithms use a similar set of techniques. It is extremely valuable to discuss and analyze these techniques, and we expect broader pictures and paradigms to emerge. This would allow us to develop algorithms for newer problems with greater ease. Understanding these recurrent themes and intuition behind the development of these algorithms is one of the main thrusts of the tutorial.Our goal will be to cover a wide spectrum of these topics and make the researchers in VLDB community aware of the new algorithms, optimum or approximate, offline or streaming.

Past efforts have relied on segmenting the signal sequences by hand, which is both time-consuming and error-prone. In our view, segments should correspond to atomic human activities that enable a goal-recognizer to operate optimally the two are intimately related. In this paper, we present a novel method for building probabilistic activity models at the same time as we segment signal sequences into motion patterns. We model each motion pattern as a linear dynamic model and the transitions between motion patterns as a Markov process conditioned on goals. Our EM learning algorithm simultaneously learns the motion-pattern boundaries and probabilistic models for goals and activities, which in turn can be used to accurately recognize activities in an online phase. A major advantage of our algorithm is that it can reduce the human effort in segmenting and labeling signal sequences.

Artificial intelligence algorithms offer the capability to improve the performance or sensor networks in dynamic environments by minimizing energy utilization while not compromising overall performance.

The difficulty is further exacerbated when the agents are in an adversarial relationship, demanding that a robust (i.e. winning) non-stationary policy be rapidly learned and adapted. We propose an on-line sequence learning algorithm, ELPH, based on a straightforward entropy pruning technique that is able to rapidly learn and adapt to non-stationary policies.

Existing semisupervised learning methods belong to either generative or discriminative approaches. This paper focuses on probabilistic semi-supervised classifier design and presents a hybrid approach to take advantage of the generative and discriminative approaches. Our formulation considers a generative model trained on labeled samples and a newly introduced bias correction model. Both models belong to the same model family. The proposed hybrid model is constructed by combining both generative and bias correction models based on the maximum entropy principle. The parameters of the bias correction model are estimated by using training data, and combination weights are estimated so that labeled samples are correctly classified. We use naive Bayes models as the generative models to apply the hybrid approach to text classification problems. In our experimental results on three text data sets, we confirmed that the proposed method significantly outperformed pure generative and discriminative methods when the classification performances of the both methods were comparable.|Akinori Fujino,Naonori Ueda,Kazumi Saito","65613|AAAI|2005|Learning Measures of Progress for Planning Domains|We study an approach to learning heuristics for planning domains from example solutions. There has been little work on learning heuristics for the types of domains used in deterministic and stochastic planning competitions.

Here we introduce a new representation for heuristics based on lists of set expressions described using taxonomic syntax. Next, we review the idea of a measure of progress (parmar ), which is any heuristic that is guaranteed to be improvable at every state. We take finding a measure of progress as our learning goal, and describe a simple learning algorithm for this purpose. We evaluate our approach across a range of deterministic and stochastic planning-competition domains. The results show that often greedily following the learned heuristic is highly effective.

Our new method extends a recent advice-giving technique, called Knowledge-Based Kernel Regression (KBKR), that accepts advice concerning a single action of a reinforcement learner. In KBKR, users can say that in some set of states, an action's value should be greater than some linear expression of the current state. In our new technique, which we call Preference KBKR (Pref-KBKR), the user can provide advice in a more natural manner by recommending that some action is preferred over another in the specified set of states. Specifying preferences essentially means that users are giving advice about policies rather than Q values, which is a more natural way for humans to present advice. We present the motivation for preference advice and a proof of the correctness of our extension to KBKR. In addition, we show empirical results that our method can make effective use of advice on a novel reinforcement-learning task, based on the RoboCup simulator, which we call Breakaway. Our work demonstrates the significant potential of advice-giving techniques for addressing complex reinforcement learning problems, while further demonstrating the use of support-vector regression for reinforcement learning.|Richard Maclin,Jude W.

In most problems of real-world interest, learning this value function requires a function approximator. which represents the mapping from stateaction pairs to values via a concise, parameterized function and uses supervised learning methods to set its parameters. Function approximators make it possible to use temporal difference methods on large problems but, in practice, the feasibility of doing so depends on the ability of the human designer to select an appropriate representation for the value function. My thesis presents a new approach to function approximation that automates some of these difficult design choices by coupling temporal difference methods with policy search methods such as evolutionary computation. It also presents a particular implementation which combines NEAT, a neuroevolutionary policy search method, and Q-learning, a popular temporal difference method, to yield a new method called NEAT+Q that automatically learns effective representations for neural network function approximators.

This is particularly expensive to obtain for structured prediction tasks, where each training instance may have multiple, interacting labels, all of which must be correctly annotated for the instance to be of use to the learner. Traditional active learning addresses this problem by optimizing the order in which the examples are labeled to increase learning efficiency. However, this approach does not consider the difficulty of labeling each example, which can vary widely in structured prediction tasks. For example, the labeling predicted by a partially trained system may be easier to correct for some instances than for others. We propose a new active learning paradigm which reduces not only how many instances the annotator must label, but also how difficult each instance is to annotate. The system also leverages information from partially correct predictions to efficiently solicit annotations from the user. We validate this active learning framework in an interactive information extraction system, reducing the total number of annotation actions by %.|Aron Culotta,Andrew McCallum","65490|AAAI|2005|Distribution-Free Learning of Bayesian Network Structure in Continuous Domains|In this paper we present a method for learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) without making any assumptions on the probability distribution of the domain. This is mainly useful for continuous domains, where there is little guidance and many choices for the parametric distribution families to be used for the local conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network, and only a few have been examined analytically. We therefore focus on BN structure learning in continuous domains.

Our test is non-parametric, making no assumptions on the distribution of the domain. We also provide an effective and computationally efficient method for calculating it from data. We demonstrate the learning of the structure of graphical models in continuous domains from real-world data, to our knowledge for the first time using independence-based methods and without distributional assumptions.

By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution.

With the availability of the standard XML query languages, e.g. XQuery, much more powerful folder technologies are now feasible. To address this new challenge and exploit this new opportunity, this paper proposes a new and powerful dynamic folder mechanism, called Hubble. Hubble fully exploits the rich data model and semantic information embedded in the XML documents to build folder hierarchies dynamically and to categorize XML collections precisely. Besides supporting basic folder operations, Hubble also provides advanced features such as multi-path navigation and folder traversal across multiple document collections. Our performance study shows that Hubble is both efficient and scalable. Thus, it is an ideal technology for automating the process of organizing and categorizing XML documents.|Ning Li,Joshua Hui,Hui-I Hsiao,Kevin S.

We propose a series of optimizations which transform XQuery queries so that they can be correctly executed with a single pass on the dataset.. We present a methodology for determining when an XQuery query, possibly after the transformations we introduce, can be correctly executed with only a single pass on the dataset.. We describe a code generation approach which can handle XQuery queries with user-defined aggregates, including recursive functions.

The limitations of these approaches are well known in research and industry. Thus, a forthcoming version of DB Universal Database&reg is enhanced with comprehensive native XML support. \"Native\" means that XML documents are stored on disk pages in tree structures matching the XML data model. This avoids the mapping between XML and relational structures, and the corresponding limitations. The native XML storage is complemented with XML indexes, full XQuery, SQLXML, and XML Schema support, as well as utilities such as a parallel high-speed XML bulk loader. This makes DB a true hybrid database system which places equal weight on XML and relational data management.|Matthias Nicola,Bert Van der Linden","80477|VLDB|2005|Structure and Content Scoring for XML|XML repositories are usually queried both on structure and content. Due to structural heterogeneity of XML, queries are often interpreted approximately and their answers are returned ranked by scores. Computing answer scores in XML is an active area of research that oscillates between pure content scoring such as the well-known tf*idf and taking structure into account. However, none of the existing proposals fully accounts for structure and combines it with content to score query answers. We propose novel XML scoring methods that are inspired by tf*idf and that account for both structure and content while considering query relaxations. Twig scoring, accounts for the most structure and content and is thus used as our reference method. Path scoring is an approximation that loosens correlations between query nodes hence reducing the amount of time required to manipulate scores during top-k query processing. We propose efficient data structures in order to speed up ranked query processing. We run extensive experiments that validate our scoring methods and that show that path scoring provides very high precision while improving score computation time.|Sihem Amer-Yahia,Nick Koudas,Am√©lie Marian,Divesh Srivastava,David Toman","80476|VLDB|2005|Personalizing XML Text Search in PimenT|A growing number of text-rich XML repositories are being made available.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to process a twig query based on region encoding labeling scheme. While region encoding supports efficient determination of structural relationship between two elements, we observe that the information within a single label is very limited. In this paper, we propose a new labeling scheme, called extended Dewey. This is a powerful labeling scheme, since from the label of an element alone, we can derive all the elements names along the path from the root to the element. Based on extended Dewey, we design a novel holistic twig join algorithm, called TJFast. Unlike all previous algorithms based on region encoding, to answer a twig query, TJFast only needs to access the labels of the leaf query nodes. Through this, not only do we reduce disk access, but we also support the efficient evaluation of queries with wildcards in branching nodes, which is very difficult to be answered by algorithms based on region encoding. Finally, we report our experimental results to show that our algorithms are superior to previous approaches in terms of the number of elements scanned, the size of intermediate results and query performance.|Jiaheng Lu,Tok Wang Ling,Chee Yong Chan,Ting Chen","80593|VLDB|2005|WmXML A System for Watermarking XML Data|As increasing amount of data is published in the form of XML, copyright protection of XML data is becoming an important requirement for many applications.

To overcome these challenges, the watermarking scheme has to be based on the usability of data and the underlying semantics like key attributes and functional dependencies. In this paper, we describe WmXML, a system for watermarking XML documents. It generates queries from essential semantics to identify the available watermarking bandwidth in XML documents, and integrates query rewriting technique to overcome the threats from data re-organization and alteration.

The reason is that XML query operators are much more complex than relational operators such as table scans and joins. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called COMET, to modeling the cost of XML operators to our knowledge, COMET is the first method ever proposed for addressing the XML query costing problem. As in relational cost estimation, COMET exploits a set of system catalog statistics that summarizes the XML data the set of \"simple path\" statistics that we propose is new, and is well suited to the XML setting. Unlike the traditional approach, COMET uses a new statistical learning technique called \"transform regression\" instead of detailed analytical models to predict the overall cost. Besides rendering the cost estimation problem tractable for XML queries, COMET has the further advantage of enabling the query optimizer to be self-tuning, automatically adapting to changes over time in the query workload and in the system environment. We demonstrate COMET's feasibility by developing a cost model for the recently proposed XNAV navigational operator. Empirical studies with synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets show that COMET can quickly obtain accurate cost estimates for a variety of XML queries and data sets.|Ning Zhang 0002,Peter J.

In many cases, planners must compute a planning graph for each element of a set of states. The naive technique enumerates the graphs individually. This is equivalent to solving an all-pairs shortest path problem by iterating a single-source algorithm over each source. We introduce a structure, the state agnostic planning graph, that directly, solves the all-pairs problem for the relaxation introduced by planning graphs. The technique can also be characterized as exploiting the overlap present in sets of planning graphs. For the purpose of exposition, we first present the technique in classical planning.

The proposed algorithms search for the speech segment maximizing the average observation probability along the most likely path in the hypothesized keyword model. As known, this approach (sometimes referred to as sliding model method) requires a relaxation of the beginendpoints of the Viterbi matching, as well as a time normalization of the resulting score. This makes solutions complex (i.e., LN basic operations for keyword HMM models with L states and utterances with N frames). We present here two altemative (quite simple and efficient) solutions to this problem. a) First we provide a method that finds the optimal segmentation according to the criteria of maximizing the average observation probability. It uses Dynamic Programming as a step, but does not require scoring for all possible beginendpoints. While the worst case remains O(LN), this technique converged in at most (L+)N basic operations in each experiment for two very different applications. b) The second proposed algorithm does not provide a segmentation but can be used for the decision problem of whether the utterance should be classified as containing the keyword or not (provided a predefined threshold on the acceptable average observation probability).

These techniques represent the input in terms broader characteristics and improve efficiency of various applications, e.g., learning, classification, event detection, among many others. In a recent past, the synopsis techniques have gained more currency due to the emerging areas like data stream management.In this tutorial, we propose to revisit algorithms for Wavelet and Histogram synopsis construction. In the recent years, a significant number of papers have appeared which has advanced the state-of-the-art in synopsis construction considerably. In particular, we have seen the development of a large number of efficient algorithms which are also guaranteed to be near optimal. Furthermore, these synopsis construction problems have found deep roots in theory and database systems, and have influenced a wide range of problems. In a different level, a large number of the synopsis construction algorithms use a similar set of techniques. It is extremely valuable to discuss and analyze these techniques, and we expect broader pictures and paradigms to emerge. This would allow us to develop algorithms for newer problems with greater ease. Understanding these recurrent themes and intuition behind the development of these algorithms is one of the main thrusts of the tutorial.Our goal will be to cover a wide spectrum of these topics and make the researchers in VLDB community aware of the new algorithms, optimum or approximate, offline or streaming.

However, most approaches define new languages for querying RDF data, which has the following shortcomings ) They are difficult to integrate with SQL queries used in database applications, and ) They incur inefficiency as data has to be transformed from SQL to the corresponding language data format. This paper proposes a SQL based scheme that avoids these problems. Specifically, it introduces a SQL table function RDFMATCH to query RDF data. The results of RDFMATCH table function can be further processed by SQL's rich querying capabilities and seamlessly combined with queries on traditional relational data. Furthermore, the RDFMATCH table function invocation is rewritten as a SQL query, thereby avoiding run-time table function procedural overheads. It also enables optimization of rewritten query in conjunction with the rest of the query. The resulting query is executed efficiently by making use of B-tree indexes as well as specialized subject-property materialized views. This paper describes the functionality of the RDFMATCH table function for querying RDF data, which can optionally include user-defined rulebases, and discusses its implementation in Oracle RDBMS. It also presents an experimental study characterizing the overhead eliminated by avoiding procedural code at runtime, characterizing performance under various input conditions, and demonstrating scalability using  million RDF triples from UniProt protein and annotation data.|Eugene Inseok Chong,Souripriya Das,George Eadon,Jagannathan Srinivasan","80542|VLDB|2005|Database-Inspired Search|\"WQL A Query Language for the WWW\", published in , presented a language with several distinctive features.

As an input the planners take a domain description D in action language AL which allows state constraints (non-stratified axioms), together with a set of CNF formulae describing the initial state, and a set of literals representing the goal. We propose two approximations of the transition diagram T defined by D. Both approximations are deterministic transition functions and can be computed efficiently. Moreover they are sound (and sometimes complete) with respect to T. In its search for a plan, an approximation based planner analyses paths of an approximation instead of that of T. CPApc and CPAph are forward, best first search planners based on this idea. We compare them with two state-of-the-art conformant planners, KACMBP and Conformant-FF (CFF), over benchmarks in the literature, and over two new domains. One has large number of state constraints and another has a high degree of incompleteness. Our planners perform reasonably well in benchmark domains and outperform KACMBP and CFF in the first domain while still working well with the second one. Our experimental result shows that having an integral part of a conformant planner to deal with state constraints directly can significantly improve its performance extending a similar claim for classical planners in (Thiebaux.

There has been little work on learning heuristics for the types of domains used in deterministic and stochastic planning competitions. Perhaps one reason for this is the challenge of providing a compact heuristic language that facilitates learning. Here we introduce a new representation for heuristics based on lists of set expressions described using taxonomic syntax. Next, we review the idea of a measure of progress (parmar ), which is any heuristic that is guaranteed to be improvable at every state. We take finding a measure of progress as our learning goal, and describe a simple learning algorithm for this purpose. We evaluate our approach across a range of deterministic and stochastic planning-competition domains. The results show that often greedily following the learned heuristic is highly effective. We also show our heuristic can be combined with learned rule-based policies, producing still stronger results.|Sung Wook Yoon,Alan Fern,Robert Givan","65418|AAAI|2005|Genome Rearrangement and Planning|The genome rearrangement problem is to find the most economical explanation for observed differences between the gene orders of two genomes.

Phases are introduced into a model to represent relevant execution history, but there is no physical manifestation of phases in the real world. We treat phases as partially observable state features and show how a belief distribution over phase configurations can be derived from observable state features through the use of transient analysis for Markov chains. This results in an efficient method for phase tracking during execution that can be combined with the QMDP value method for POMDPs to make action choices.

The assumption is that popularity is closely correlated with quality, a more elusive concept that is difficult to measure directly. Unfortunately, the correlation between popularity and quality is very weak for newly-created pages that have yet to receive many visits andor in-links. Worse, since discovery of new content is largely done by querying search engines, and because users usually focus their attention on the top few results, newly-created but high-quality pages are effectively \"shut out,\" and it can take a very long time before they become popular.We propose a simple and elegant solution to this problem the introduction of a controlled amount of randomness into search result ranking methods. Doing so offers new pages a chance to prove their worth, although clearly using too much randomness will degrade result quality and annul any benefits achieved. Hence there is a tradeoff between exploration to estimate the quality of new pages and exploitation of pages already known to be of high quality. We study this tradeoff both analytically and via simulation, in the context of an economic objective function based on aggregate result quality amortized over time. We show that a modest amount of randomness leads to improved search results.|Sandeep Pandey,Sourashis Roy,Christopher Olston,Junghoo Cho,Soumen Chakrabarti","65549|AAAI|2005|Planning for Stream Processing Systems|With the advent of compositional programming models in computer Science, applying planning technologies to automatically build workflows for solving large and complex problems in such a paradigm becomes not only technically appealing but also feasible approach.

RL is applied to an online resource allocation task in a distributed multi-application computing environment with independent time-varying load in each application. The task is to allocate servers in real time so as to maximize the sum of performance-based expected utility in each application. This task may be treated as a composite MDP, and to exploit the problem structure, a simple localized RL approach is proposed, with better scalability than previous approaches. The RL approach is tested in a realistic prototype data center comprising real servers, real HTTP requests, and realistic time-varying demand. This domain poses a number of major challenges associated with live training in a real system, including the need for rapid training, exploration that avoids excessive penalties, and handling complex, potentially non-Markovian system effects. The early results are encouraging in overnight training, RL performs as well as or slightly better than heavily researched model-based approaches derived from queuing theory.|Gerald Tesauro","65512|AAAI|2005|Geometric Variance Reduction in Markov Chains Application to Value Function and Gradient Estimation|We study a sequential variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo estimation of functionals in Markov Chains. The method is based on designing sequential control variates using successive approximations of the function of interest V. Regular Monte Carlo estimates have a variance of O(N), where N is the number of samples. Here, we obtain a geometric variance reduction O(N) (with   ) up to a threshold that depends on the approximation error V - AV, where A is an approximation operator linear in the values. Thus, if V belongs to the right approximation space (i.e. AV  V), the variance decreases geometrically to zero. An immediate application is value function estimation in Markov chains, which may be used for policy evaluation in policy iteration for Markov Decision Processes. Another important domain, for which variance reduction is highly needed, is gradient estimation, that is computing the sensitivity , V of the performance measure V with respect to some parameter  of the transition probabilities. For example, in parametric optimization of the policy, an estimate of the policy gradient is required to perform a gradient optimization method. We show that, using two approximations, the value function and the gradient, a geometric variance reduction is also achieved, up to a threshold that depends on the approximation errors of both of those representations.|R√©mi Munos","65580|AAAI|2005|Autonomous Color Learning on a Mobile Robot|Color segmentation is a challenging subtask in computer vision.

This paper proposes a novel framework generalizing Samuel's paradigm using a coordinate-free approach to value function approximation. Agents learn both representations and value functions by constructing geometrically customized task-independent basis functions that form an orthonormal set for the Hilbert space of smooth functions on the underlying state space manifold. The approach rests on a technical result showing that the space of smooth functions on a (compact) Riemanian manifold has a discrete spectrum associated with the Laplace-Beltrami operator. In the discrete setting, spectral analysis of the graph Laplacian yields a set of geometrically customized basis functions for approximating and decomposing value functions. The proposed framework generalizes Samuel's value function approximation paradigm by combining it with a formalization of Saul Amarel's paradigm of representation learning through global state space analysis.|Sridhar Mahadevan"],["80566|VLDB|2005|XQuery Implementation in a Relational Database System|Many enterprise applications prefer to store XML data as a rich data type, i.e. a sequence of bytes, in a relational database system to avoid the complexity of decomposing the data into a large number of tables and the cost of reassembling the XML data.

For example, in combinatorial auctions we may wish to guarantee that we can always find a repair solution whose revenue exceeds some threshold while limiting the cost associated with forming such a repair. In this paper we present the weighted super solution framework that involves two important extensions. Firstly, the set of variables that may lose their values is determined using a probabilistic approach enabling us to find repair solutions for assignments that are most likely to fail. Secondly, we include a mechanism for reasoning about the cost of repair.

DITN uses an alternate intra-fragment parallelism where each node executes an independent select-project-join-aggregate-group by block, with no tuple exchange between nodes. This method cleanly handles heterogeneous nodes, and well adapts during execution to node failures or load spikes.Initial experiments suggest that DITN performs competitively with a traditional configuration of dedicated machines and well-partitioned data for up to  processors at least.

The classic problem involves allocating trials to the arms of a multiarmed slot machine to maximize the expected sum of rewards. We pose a new variation of the multiarmed bandit--the Max K-Armed Bandit--in which trials must be allocated among the arms to maximize the expected best single sample reward of the series of trials. Motivation for the Max K-Armed Bandit is the allocation of restarts among a set of multistart stochastic search algorithms. We present an analysis of this Max K-Armed Bandit showing under certain assumptions that the optimal strategy allocates trials to the observed best arm at a rate increasing double exponentially relative to the other arms. This motivates an exploration strategy that follows a Boltzmann distribution with an exponentially decaying temperature parameter. We compare this exploration policy to policies that allocate trials to the observed best arm at rates faster (and slower) than double exponentially. The results confirm, for two scheduling domains, that the double exponential increase in the rate of allocations to the observed best heuristic outperfonns the other approaches.|Vincent A.

The second approach is to search the parameter space of VVCAs in order to obtain high-revenue mechanisms for the general problem. We introduce a series of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that use economic insights to guide the search and thus reduce the computational complexity. Our experiments demonstrate that in many cases these algorithms perform almost as well as the optimal VVCA, yield a substantial increase in revenue over the VCG mechanism and drastically outperform the straightforward algorithms in run-time.|Anton Likhodedov,Tuomas Sandholm","65450|AAAI|2005|A New Strategy-Proof Greedy-Allocation Combinatorial Auction Protocol and Its Extension to Open Ascending Auction Protocol|This paper proposes a new combinatorial auction protocol called Average-Max-Minimal-Bundle (AM-MB) protocol.

They interleave a local lookahead search with movement execution, explore an initially unknown map, and converge to better paths over repeated experiences. In this paper, we first investigate how three known extensions of the most popular learning real-time search algorithm (LRTA*) influence its performance in a path-finding domain. Then, we combine automatic state abstraction with learning real-time search. Our scheme of dynamically building a state abstraction allows us to generalize updates to the heuristic function, thereby speeding up learning. The novel algorithm converges up to  times faster than LRTA* with only one fifth of the response time of A*.|Vadim Bulitko,Nathan R.

In this paper we propose a novel approach for query translation disambiguation, named \"spectral query translation model\". The proposed approach views the problem of query translation disambiguation as a graph partitioning problem. For a given query, a weighted graph is first created for all possible translations of query words based on the co-occurrence statistics of the translation words. The best translation of the query is then determined by the most strongly connected component within the graph. The proposed approach distinguishes from previous approaches in that the translations of all query words are estimated simultaneously. Furthermore, translation probabilities are introduced in the proposed approach to capture the uncertainty in translating queries. Empirical studies with TREC datasets have shown that the spectral query translation model achieves a relative % -% improvement in cross-language information retrieval, compared to other approaches that also exploit word co-occurrence statistics for query translation disambiguation.|Yi Liu,Rong Jin","65600|AAAI|2005|Improving Reinforcement Learning Function Approximators via Neuroevolution|Reinforcement learning problems are commonly tackled with temporal difference methods, which use dynamic programming and statistical sampling to estimate the long-term value of taking each action in each state. In most problems of real-world interest, learning this value function requires a function approximator. which represents the mapping from stateaction pairs to values via a concise, parameterized function and uses supervised learning methods to set its parameters. Function approximators make it possible to use temporal difference methods on large problems but, in practice, the feasibility of doing so depends on the ability of the human designer to select an appropriate representation for the value function. My thesis presents a new approach to function approximation that automates some of these difficult design choices by coupling temporal difference methods with policy search methods such as evolutionary computation. It also presents a particular implementation which combines NEAT, a neuroevolutionary policy search method, and Q-learning, a popular temporal difference method, to yield a new method called NEAT+Q that automatically learns effective representations for neural network function approximators. Empirical results in a server job scheduling task demonstrate that NEAT+Q can outperform both NEAT and Q-learning with manually designed neural networks.|Shimon Whiteson","65568|AAAI|2005|Improving Action Selection in MDPs via Knowledge Transfer|Temporal-difference reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied in several domains with large state sets. Large action sets, however, have received considerably less attention. This paper demonstrates the use of knowledge transfer between related tasks to accelerate learning with large action sets. We introduce action transfer, a technique that extracts the actions from the (near-)optimal solution to the first task and uses them in place of the full action set when learning any subsequent tasks. When optimal actions make up a small fraction of the domain's action set, action transfer can substantially reduce the number of actions and thus the complexity of the problem. However, action transfer between dissimilar tasks can be detrimental. To address this difficulty, we contribute randomized task perturbation (RTP), an enhancement to action transfer that makes it robust to unrepresentative source tasks. We motivate RTP action transfer with a detailed theoretical analysis featuring a formalism of related tasks and a bound on the suboptimality of action transfer. The empirical results in this paper show the potential of RTP action transfer to substantially expand the applicability of RL to problems with large action sets.|Alexander A.

It requires the learning algorithms themselves to be in equilibrium for any game selected from a set of (initially unknown) games. In an optimal ELE, the learning algorithms would efficiently obtain the surplus the agents would obtain in an optimal Nash equilibrium of the initially unknown game which is played. The crucial part is that in an ELE deviations from the learning algorithms would become nonbeneficial after polynomial time, although the game played is initially unknown. While appealing conceptually, the main challenge for establishing learning algorithms based on this concept is to isolate general classes of games where an ELE exists. Unfortunately, it has been shown that while an ELE exists for the setting in which each agent can observe all other agents' actions and payoffs, an ELE does not exist in general when the other agents' payoffs cannot be observed. In this paper we provide the first positive results on this problem, constructively proving the existence of an optimal ELE for the class of symmetric games where an agent can not observe other agents' payoffs.|Ronen I.

These diagrams, which often appear similar to cubist paintings, provide a variety of interesting insights, including that current optimizers make extremely fine-grained plan choices, which may often be supplanted by less efficient options without substantively affecting the quality that the plan optimality regions may have highly intricate patterns and irregular boundaries, indicating strongly non-linear cost models that non-monotonic cost behavior exists where increasing result cardinalities decrease the estimated cost and, that the basic assumptions underlying the research literature on parametric query optimization often do not hold in practice.|Naveen Reddy,Jayant R. Haritsa","80485|VLDB|2005|Efficient Evaluation of XQuery over Streaming Data|With the growing popularity of XML and emergence of streaming data model, processing queries over streaming XML has become an important topic. This paper presents a new framework and a set of techniques for processing XQuery over streaming data. As compared to the existing work on supporting XPathXQuery over data streams, we make the following three contributions. We propose a series of optimizations which transform XQuery queries so that they can be correctly executed with a single pass on the dataset.. We present a methodology for determining when an XQuery query, possibly after the transformations we introduce, can be correctly executed with only a single pass on the dataset.. We describe a code generation approach which can handle XQuery queries with user-defined aggregates, including recursive functions. We aggressively use static analysis and generate executable code, i.e., do not require a query plan to be interpreted at runtime.We have evaluated our implementation using several XMark benchmarks and three other XQuery queries driven by real applications. Our experimental results show that as compared to QizxOpen, Saxon, and Galax, our system ) is at least % faster on XMark queries with small datasets, ) is significantly faster on XMark queries with larger datasets, ) at least one order of magnitude faster on the queries driven by real applications, as unlike other systems, we can transform them to execute with a single pass, and ) executes queries efficiently on large datasets when other systems often have memory overflows.|Xiaogang Li,Gagan Agrawal","80583|VLDB|2005|Semantic Query Optimization for XQuery over XML Streams|We study XML stream-specific schema-based optimization. We assume a widely-adopted automata-based execution model for XQuery evaluation. Criteria are established regarding what schema constraints are useful to a particular query. How to apply multiple optimization techniques on an XQuery is then addressed. Finally we present how to correctly and efficiently execute a plan enhanced with our SQO techniques. Our experimentation on both real and synthetic data illustrates that these techniques bring significant performance improvement with little overhead.|Hong Su,Elke A. Rundensteiner,Murali Mani","80585|VLDB|2005|An Efficient and Versatile Query Engine for TopX Search|This paper presents a novel engine, coined TopX, for efficient ranked retrieval of XML documents over semistructured but nonschematic data collections. The algorithm follows the paradigm of threshold algorithms for top-k query processing with a focus on inexpensive sequential accesses to index lists and only a few judiciously scheduled random accesses. The difficulties in applying the existing top-k algorithms to XML data lie in ) the need to consider scores for XML elements while aggregating them at the document level, ) the combination of vague content conditions with XML path conditions, ) the need to relax query conditions if too few results satisfy all conditions, and ) the selectivity estimation for both content and structure conditions and their impact on evaluation strategies. TopX addresses these issues by precomputing score and path information in an appropriately designed index structure, by largely avoiding or postponing the evaluation of expensive path conditions so as to preserve the sequential access pattern on index lists, and by selectively scheduling random accesses when they are cost-beneficial. In addition, TopX can compute approximate top-k results using probabilistic score estimators, thus speeding up queries with a small and controllable loss in retrieval precision.|Martin Theobald,Ralf Schenkel,Gerhard Weikum","80561|VLDB|2005|SVM in Oracle Database g Removing the Barriers to Widespread Adoption of Support Vector Machines|Contemporary commercial databases are placing an increased emphasis on analytic capabilities. Data mining technology has become crucial in enabling the analysis of large volumes of data. Modern data mining techniques have been shown to have high accuracy and good generalization to novel data. However, achieving results of good quality often requires high levels of user expertise. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful state-of-the-art data mining algorithm that can address problems not amenable to traditional statistical analysis. Nevertheless, its adoption remains limited due to methodological complexities, scalability challenges, and scarcity of production quality SVM implementations. This paper describes Oracle's implementation of SVM where the primary focus lies on ease of use and scalability while maintaining high performance accuracy. SVM is fully integrated within the Oracle database framework and thus can be easily leveraged in a variety of deployment scenarios.|Boriana L. Milenova,Joseph Yarmus,Marcos M.

The limitations of these approaches are well known in research and industry. Thus, a forthcoming version of DB Universal Database&reg is enhanced with comprehensive native XML support. \"Native\" means that XML documents are stored on disk pages in tree structures matching the XML data model. This avoids the mapping between XML and relational structures, and the corresponding limitations. The native XML storage is complemented with XML indexes, full XQuery, SQLXML, and XML Schema support, as well as utilities such as a parallel high-speed XML bulk loader. This makes DB a true hybrid database system which places equal weight on XML and relational data management.|Matthias Nicola,Bert Van der Linden","80529|VLDB|2005|Getting Priorities Straight Improving Linux Support for Database IO|The Linux . kernel supports asynchronous IO as a result of propositions from the database industry. This is a positive evolution but is it a panacea In the context of the Badger project, a collaboration between MySQL AB and University of Copenhagen, we evaluate how MySQLInnoDB can best take advantage of Linux asynchronous IO and how Linux can help MySQLInnoDB best take advantage of the underlying IO bandwidth. This is a crucial problem for the increasing number of MySQL servers deployed for very large database applications. In this paper, we first show that the conservative IO submission policy used by InnoDB (as well as Oracle .) leads to an under-utilization of the available IO bandwidth. We then show that introducing prioritized asynchronous IO in Linux will allow MySQLInnoDB and the other Linux databases to fully utilize the available IO bandwith using a more aggressive IO submission policy.|Christoffer Hall,Philippe Bonnet","80519|VLDB|2005|Database Change Notifications Primitives for Efficient Database Query Result Caching|Many database applications implement caching of data from a back-end database server to avoid repeated round trips to the back-end and to improve response times for end-user requests. For example, consider a web application that caches dynamic web content in the mid-tier , . The content of dynamic web pages is usually assembled from data stored in the underlying database system and subject to modification whenever the data sources are modified. The workload is ideal for caching query results most queries are read-only (browsing sessions) and only a small portion of the queries are actually modifying data. Caching at the mid-tier helps off-load the back-end database servers and can increase scalability of a distributed system drastically.|C√©sar A.

They offer an attractive user interface, provide an easy to use computational model, and offer substantial interactivity for what-if analysis. However, as opposed to RDBMS, spreadsheets do not provide a central repository hence they do not provide shareability of models built in Excel and lead to proliferation of multiple copies of the same spreadsheet. Furthermore, spreadsheets do not offer scalable computation, for example, they lack parallelization. To address the shareability, and scalability problems, we propose to automatically translate Excel computation into SQL. An analyst can import the data from a relational system, define computation over it using familiar Excel formulas and then translate and store it as a relational SQL view over the imported data. The Excel computation is then performed by the relational system. To edit the model, the analyst can bring the model back to Excel, modify it in Excel and store it back as an SQL View. We refer to this system as Query by Excel, QBX in short.|Andrew Witkowski,Srikanth Bellamkonda,Tolga Bozkaya,Aman Naimat,Lei Sheng,Sankar Subramanian,Allison Waingold"],["80566|VLDB|2005|XQuery Implementation in a Relational Database System|Many enterprise applications prefer to store XML data as a rich data type, i.e. a sequence of bytes, in a relational database system to avoid the complexity of decomposing the data into a large number of tables and the cost of reassembling the XML data. The upcoming release of Microsoft's SQL Server supports XQuery as the query language over such XML data using its relational infrastructure.XQuery is an emerging WC recommendation for querying XML data. It provides a set of language constructs (FLWOR), the ability to dynamically shape the query result, and a large set of functions and operators. It includes the emerging WC recommendation XPath . for path-based navigational access. XQuery's type system is compatible with that of XML Schema and allows static type checking.This paper describes the experiences and the challenges in implementing XQuery in Microsoft's SQL Server . XQuery language constructs are compiled into an enhanced set of relational operators while preserving the semantics of XQuery. The query tree is optimized using relational optimization techniques, such as cost-based decisions, and rewrite rules based on XML schemas. Novel techniques are used for efficiently managing document order and XML hierarchy.|Shankar Pal,Istvan Cseri,Oliver Seeliger,Michael Rys,Gideon Schaller,Wei Yu,Dragan Tomic,Adrian Baras,Brandon Berg,Denis Churin,Eugene Kogan","65447|AAAI|2005|On Compiling System Models for Faster and More Scalable Diagnosis|Knowledge compilation is one of the more traditional approaches to model-based diagnosis, where a compiled system model is obtained in an off-line phase, and then used to efficiently answer diagnostic queries on-line. The choice of a suitable representation for the compiled model is critical to the success of this approach, and two of the main proposals have been Decomposable Negation Normal Form (DNNF) and Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD). The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we show that in the current state of the art, DNNF dominates OBDD in efficiency and scalability for some typical diagnostic tasks. This result is based on a step-by-step comparison of the complexities of diagnostic algorithms for DNNF and OBDD, together with a known succinctness relation between the two representations. Second, we present a tool for model-based diagnosis, which is based on a state-of-the-art DNNF compiler and our implementations of DNNF diagnostic algorithms. We demonstrate the efficiency of this tool against recent results reported on diagnosis using OBDD.|Jinbo Huang,Adnan Darwiche","65380|AAAI|2005|A Learning and Reasoning System for Intelligence Analysis|This paper presents a personal cognitive assistant, called Disciple-LTA, that can acquire expertise in intelligence analysis directly from intelligence analysts, can train new analysts, and can help analysts find solutions to complex problems through mixed-initiative reasoning, making possible the synergistic integration of a human's experience and creativity with an automated agent's knowledge and speed, and facilitating the collaboration with complementary experts and their agents.|Mihai Boicu,Gheorghe Tecuci,Cindy Ayers,Dorin Marcu,Cristina Boicu,Marcel Barbulescu,Bogdan Stanescu,William Wagner,Vu Le,Denitsa Apostolova,Adrian Ciubotariu","80556|VLDB|2005|The Integrated Microbial Genomes IMG System A Case Study in Biological Data Management|Biological data management includes the traditional areas of data generation, acquisition, modelling, integration, and analysis.

The advantages of a hybrid knowledge-based system are described followed by the system objectives, means of control, and constraints. A framework is provided that describes the necessary development stages of a commercial knowledge-based package. An overview of the utility knowledge acquisition procedure is provided to appreciate the complexity of defining the rule base. This is followed by a description of the flow of information in a three-level hierarchical rule base and a summary of network radiality, parameter. and performance rules employed in this rule base. After a heuristic preprocessor identifies a list of switch closures that would seem to reduce total system losses, network radiality rules assess if a particular search path has identified a switch that can be closed and a corresponding switch opened to maintain the radiality of the system or if the path is worth pursuing further. Network parameter rules ensure the system operates within original design parameters. Network performance rules assess the reduction in total system losses of each proposed switching operation. Where there is a coupling between knowledge-based and numerical methods, the integration of numerical methods is described. Finally, the validation and simulations as well as the benefits of this hybrid knowledge-based system are described.|Robert J. S√°rfi,A. M. G.

While digital watermarking is a widely used measure to protect digital data from copyright offences, the complex and flexible construction of XML data poses a number of challenges to digital watermarking, such as re-organization and alteration attacks. To overcome these challenges, the watermarking scheme has to be based on the usability of data and the underlying semantics like key attributes and functional dependencies. In this paper, we describe WmXML, a system for watermarking XML documents. It generates queries from essential semantics to identify the available watermarking bandwidth in XML documents, and integrates query rewriting technique to overcome the threats from data re-organization and alteration. In the demonstration, we will showcase the use of WmXML and its effectiveness in countering various attacks.|Xuan Zhou,HweeHwa Pang,Kian-Lee Tan,Dhruv Mangla","65419|AAAI|2005|WebCrow A Web-Based System for Crossword Solving|Language games represent one of the most fascinating challenges of research in artificial intelligence.
