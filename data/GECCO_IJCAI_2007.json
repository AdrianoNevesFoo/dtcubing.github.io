In this paper we examine the use of Genetic Programming and a Genetic Algorithm to pre-process data before it is classified by an external classifier.

We propose a masking process model to capture the stochastic nature of information loss. Learning in this context is employed as a means to recover as much of the missing information as is recoverable. We extend the Probably Approximately Correct semantics to the case of learning from partial observations with arbitrarily hidden attributes. We establish that simply requiring learned hypotheses to be consistent with observed values suffices to guarantee that hidden values are recoverable to a certain accuracy we also show that, in some sense, this is an optimal strategy for achieving accurate recovery. We then establish that a number of natural concept classes, including all the classes of monotone formulas that are PAC learnable by monotone formulas, and the classes of conjunctions, disjunctions, k-CNF, k-DNF, and linear thresholds, are consistently learnable from partial observations. We finally show that the concept classes of parities and monotone term -decision lists are not properly consistently learnable from partial observations, if RP  NP. This implies a separation of what is consistently learnable from partial observations versus what is learnable in the complete or noisy setting.|Loizos Michael","57883|GECCO|2007|XCS for adaptive user-interfaces|We outline our context learning framework that harnesses information from a user's environment to learn user preferences for application actions.

Unfortunately, these techniques are based on specialized training algorithms, are complex to implement, and expensive to run. We present a much simpler approach to training structured predictors by applying a boosting-like procedure to standard supervised training methods. The idea is to learn a local predictor using standard methods, such as logistic regression or support vector machines, but then achieve improved structured classification by \"boosting\" the influence of misclassified components after structured prediction, re-training the local predictor, and repeating. Further improvement in structured prediction accuracy can be achieved by incorporating \"dynamic\" features--i.e. an extension whereby the features for one predicted component can depend on the predictions already made for some other components. We apply our techniques to the problem of learning dependency parsers from annotated natural language corpora. By using logistic regression as an efficient base classifier (for predicting dependency links between word pairs), we are able to efficiently train a dependency parsing model, via structured boosting, that achieves state of the art results in English, and surpasses state of the art in Chinese.|Qin Iris Wang,Dekang Lin,Dale Schuurmans","16349|IJCAI|2007|A Subspace Kernel for Nonlinear Feature Extraction|Kernel based nonlinear Feature Extraction (KFE) or dimensionality reduction is a widely used preprocessing step in pattern classification and data mining tasks. Given a positive definite kernel function, it is well known that the input data are implicitly mapped to a feature space with usually very high dimensionality. The goal of KFE is to find a low dimensional subspace of this feature space, which retains most of the information needed for classification or data analysis. In this paper, we propose a subspace kernel based on which the feature extraction problem is transformed to a kernel parameter learning problem. The key observation is that when projecting data into a low dimensional subspace of the feature space, the parameters that are used for describing this subspace can be regarded as the parameters of the kernel function between the projected data. Therefore current kernel parameter learning methods can be adapted to optimize this parameterized kernel function. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.|Mingrui Wu,Jason D. R.

We introduce a framework for learning Datalog definitions for web sources, in which we actively invoke sources and compare the data they produce with that of known sources of information. We perform an inductive search through the space of plausible source definitions in order to learn the best possible semantic model for each new source.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design. Our contribution is the introduction of a general technique for designing SVM kernels tailored for the classification of sequence data.|Young-In Shin,Donald S.

We show that when the topological network is over one of the three maximal tractable subclasses of RCC, the problem can be reduced into satisfiability problems in the RCC algebra and the rectangle algebra (RA). Therefore, reasoning techniques developed for RCC and RA can be used to solve the satisfiability problem of a joint network.|Sanjiang Li","16739|IJCAI|2007|Complexity Results for Checking Equivalence of Stratified Logic Programs|Recent research in nonmonotonic logic programming under the answer-set semantics focuses on different notions of program equivalence.

In this paper, we consider such programs, possibly augmented with constraints. Our results show that in the propositional setting, where reasoning is well-known to be polynomial, deciding strong and uniform equivalence is as hard as for arbitrary normal logic programs (and thus coNP-complete), but is polynomial in some restricted cases. Nonground programs behave similarly. However, exponential lower bounds already hold for small programs (i.e., with constantly many rules). In particular, uniform equivalence is undecidable even for small Horn programs plus a single negative constraint.|Thomas Eiter,Michael Fink,Hans Tompits,Stefan Woltran","16677|IJCAI|2007|Consistency Checking of Basic Cardinal Constraints over Connected Regions|In this paper we study a recent formal model for qualitative spatial reasoning with cardinal direction relations.

Amongst optimisation algorithms driven by evolutionary computation techniques,particle swarm algorithms have proven to be a very good alternative to genetic algorithms because of their faster convergence. However they can still suffer from premature convergence to local optima. Premature convergence occurs when the particles of the swarm are too close to each other to enable further exploration of the space. To put it another way, the dispersion or distribution of the swarm throughout the search space has been localised to a small region with a consequent stagnation of the search process. Many strategies have been used to try to prevent convergence to a local optimum. However little work has been done on problems of high dimensions. By high dimensions, we mean dimensions of  and above.This paper focuses, therefore, on the limitations of classical particle swarm algorithms when dealing with high dimensional problems. We compare different versions of Particle Swarm Algorithms GBest, LBest with ringor random neighbourhood of size citeClerc, and GCPSOciteVanDenBergh. Those algorithmswere run twice, with a linearly decreasing inertia weight, and with the use of a constriction factor.We also used two repulsive-based algorithms Charged PSOciteBlackwell and Predator PreyciteSilva.Our main focus is problems of high dimensionality. In particular, we applied the different algorithmsto the benchmarks functions Ackley and Rosenbrock, in the following dimensions , , .Even though these represent problems of relatively small dimensionality in a real-world context,experiments on higher dimensions have not been necessary to show the limits of the algorithms studied.Each experiment was run  times. The swarm size was chosen from $    $ and so that it isnot greater than the problem size. Each experiment is  iterations long.A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the performance of each algorithms. We found that the LBest algorithms perform significantly better when used with the constriction factor.GBest and GCPSO perform better with linearly decreasing inertia with a small swarm size, but better with the constriction factorwith a big swarm size. The improvement of GCPSO on GBest is not statistically significant in our experiments. The LBest algorithms with the constriction factor seem to be the best algorithms to handle problems of high dimensionality. The LBest algorithm with fixed neighbourhood seems to be less sensitive to the size of the swarm than the LBest algorithm with randomneighbourhood. Especially, in the case of the Rosenbrock function of size , increasing the sizeof the swarm does not improve the performance of LBest with constricted factor and fixed neighbourhood.The algorithms based on repulsion between particles, i.e. Charged Swarm and Predator Prey, do not perform very well.Indeed, even if the predator prey algorithm gives quite good results, it is trapped in a local optimum, as the fitness value stagnates on a constant value for the last % of iterations. This may come from a too low levelof repulsion. Tuning the parameters used for repulsion seems to be very important for high dimensionality problems. Experiments show that almost all the algorithms managed to solve the problems for dimension  butnone of the algorithms managed to solve the problem in the case of problems of dimension  and . The LBest algorithm with random neighbourhood and constriction factor performed the best. Further work will be done on modelling the size of the swarm required to be able to solve the problems.

The present paper presents SAYU-VISTA, an algorithm which advances beyond the initial view learning approach in three ways. First, it learns views that introduce new relational tables, rather than merely new fields for an existing table of the database. Second, new tables or new fields are not limited to being approximations to some target concept instead, the new approach performs a type of predicate invention. The new approach avoids the classical problem with predicate invention, of learning many useless predicates, by keeping only new fields or tables (i.e., new predicates) that immediately improve the performance of the statistical model.

Using the same calculations and assumptions as the original model, we integrate danger theory into the software.Without anergy, both models - the original and the danger model - produce similar results. When anergy is added, both models' performance improves. However, there seems to be some synergy between the mechanisms anergy has a greater effect on the danger model than the original model.

Question answering systems include various statistical and rule-based components that combine and form multiple strategies for finding answers. However, in real-life scenarios efficiency constraints make it infeasible to simultaneously use all available strategies in a QA system. To address this issue, we present an approach for carefully selecting answering strategies that are likely to benefit individual questions, without significantly reducing performance. We evaluate the impact of strategy selection on question answering performance at several important QA stages document retrieval, answer extraction, and answer merging. We present strategy selection experiments using a statistical question answering system, and we show significant efficiency improvements. By selecting % of the available answering strategies, we obtained similar performance when compared to using all of the strategies combined.|Lucian Vlad Lita,Jaime G.

A seminal contribution in this area is the V-detectors algorithm that can very effectively cover the nonself region of the feature space with a set of detectors. The detector set can be used to detect anomalous inputs. In this paper, a multistage approach to create an effective set of V-detectors is considered. The first stage of the algorithm generates an initial set of V-detectors. In subsequent stage, new detectors are grown from existing ones, by means of a mechanism called procreation. Procreating detectors can more effectively fill hard-to-reach interstices in the nonself region, resulting in better coverage. The effectiveness of the algorithm is first illustrated by applying it to a well-known fractal, the Koch curve. The algorithm is then applied to the problem of detecting anomalous behavior in power distribution systems, and can be of much use for maintenance-related decision-making in electrical utility companies.|Min Gui,Sanjoy Das,Anil Pahwa"],["58119|GECCO|2007|Multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination for large-scale data|Web mining - data mining for web data - is a key factor of web technologies. Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme. The proposed scheme reduces Pareto-size and the appropriate number of clusters can usually be determined.|Nobukazu Matake,Tomoyuki Hiroyasu,Mitsunori Miki,Tomoharu Senda","16663|IJCAI|2007|QuantMiner A Genetic Algorithm for Mining Quantitative Association Rules|In this paper, we propose QUANTMINER, a mining quantitative association rules system.

In previous work, NER was limited to a small number of pre-defined entity classes (e.g., people, locations, and organizations). However, NER on the Web is a far more challenging problem. Complex names (e.g., film or book titles) can be very difficult to pick out precisely from text. Further, the Web contains a wide variety of entity classes, which are not known in advance. Thus, hand-tagging examples of each entity class is impractical. This paper investigates a novel approach to the first step in Web NER locating complex named entities in Web text. Our key observation is that named entities can be viewed as a species of multiword units, which can be detected by accumulating n-gram statistics over the Web corpus. We show that this statistical method's F score is % higher than that of supervised techniques including Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Conditional Markov Models (CMMs) when applied to complex names.

We model the problem as an assistant POMDP where the hidden state corresponds to the agent's unobserved goals. This formulation allows us to exploit domain models for both estimating the agent's goals and selecting assistive action. In addition, the formulation naturally handles uncertainty, varying action costs, and customization to specific agents via learning. We argue that in many domains myopic heuristics will be adequate for selecting actions in the assistant POMDP and present two such heuristics.

In this work, given such symmetries, we present a time-efficient algorithm to construct a functionally equivalent reduced model of the MDP. Further, we present a Real Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP) algorithm which obviates an explicit construction of the reduced model by integrating the given symmetries into it. The RTDP algorithm solves the reduced model, while working with parameters of the original model and the given symmetries. As RTDP uses its experience to determine which states to backup, it focuses on parts of the reduced state set that are most relevant. This results in significantly faster learning and a reduced overall execution time. The algorithms proposed are particularly effective in the case of structured automorphisms even when the reduced model does not have fewer features.

One type of semi-supervised metric learning utilizes supervisory information in the form of pairwise similarity or dissimilarity constraints. However, most methods proposed so far are either limited to linear metric learning or unable to scale up well with the data set size. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear metric learning method based on the kernel approach. By applying low-rank approximation to the kernel matrix, our method can handle significantly larger data sets. Moreover, our low-rank approximation scheme can naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. Experiments performed on both artificial and real-world data show very promising results.|Dit-Yan Yeung,Hong Chang,Guang Dai","16460|IJCAI|2007|A Labeling Approach to the Computation of Credulous Acceptance in Argumentation|In recent years, the combinatorics of argumentation with arguments that can attack each other has been studied extensively.

For many problems, the larger the population size and the longer the genetic programming run the more likely the system is to find a solution. In order to increase the probability of success on difficult problems, designers and users of genetic programming systems often desire access to distributed computation, either locally or across the internet, to evaluate fitness cases more quickly. Most systems for internet-scale distributed computation require a user's explicit participation and the installation of client side software. We present a proof-of-concept system for distributed computation of genetic programming via asynchronous javascript and XML (AJAX) techniques which requires no explicit user interaction and no installation of client side software. Clients automatically and possibly even unknowingly participate in a distributed genetic programming system simply by visiting a webpage, thereby allowing for the solution of genetic programming problems without running a single local fitness evaluation. The system can be easily introduced into existing webpages to exploit unused client-side computation for the solution of genetic programming and other problems.|Jon Klein,Lee Spector","58164|GECCO|2007|Controller design based on genetic programming|Three genetic programming-based approaches are proposed for continuous-time process control design.

The new Building Block Hill-Climber (BBHC) uses hill-climb search experience to learn the problem structure. The neighborhood structure is adapted whenever new knowledge about the underlaying BB structure is incorporated into the search. This allows the method to climb the hierarchical structure by revealing and solving consecutively the hierarchical levels. It is expected that for fully non-deceptive hierarchical BB structures the BBHC can solve hierarchical problems in linearithmic time.

The ability to evolve effective air traffic flow strategies depends not only on evolving good local strategies, but also on ensuring that those local strategies result in good global solutions. While traditional, direct evolutionary strategies can be highly effective in certain combinatorial domains, they are not well-suited to complex air traffic flow problems because of the large interdependencies among the local subsystems. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary agent-based solution to the air traffic flow problem. In this approach, we evolve agents both to learn the right local flow strategies to alleviate congestion in their immediate surroundings, and to prevent the creation of congestion \"downstream\" from their local areas. The agent-based approach leads to better and more fault-tolerant solutions. To validate this approach, we use FACET, an air traffic simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry. On a scenario composed of three hundred aircraft and two points of congestion, our results show that an agent based evolutionary computation method, where each agent uses the system evaluation function, achieves % improvement over a direct evolutionary algorithm.

However, this method of assessing a heuristic would only be relevant to a user who employs the heuristic over a set of problems which is actually representative of the set of all possible bin packing problems. On the other hand, a real world user will often only deal with packing problems that are representative of a particular sub-set. Their piece sizes will all belong to a particular distribution. The contribution of this paper is to show that a Genetic Programming system can automate the process of heuristic generation and produce heuristics that are human-competitive over a range of sets of problems, or which excel on a particular sub-set. We also show that the choice of training instances is vital in the area of automatic heuristic generation, due to the trade-off between the performance and generality of the heuristics generated and their applicability to new problems.|Edmund K.

The agents are controlled by a new kind of computational network based on a compartmentalised model of neurons. We have taken the view that the genetic basis of neurons is an important  and neglected aspect of previous approaches. Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents. Our results show that both agents exhibit interesting learning capabilities.|Gul Muhammad Khan,Julian Francis Miller,David M.

Indeed, the growth in the computing power of these graphics cards is now several orders of magnitude greater than the growth in the power of computer processor units. Thus these graphics cards are now beginning to be used by the scientific community aslow cost, high performance computing platforms. Traditional genetic programming is a highly computer intensive algorithm but due to its parallel nature it can be distributed over multiple processors to increase the speed of the algorithm considerably. This is not applicable for single processor architectures but graphics cards provide a mechanism for developing a data parallel implementation of genetic programming.

Both relative and absolute quantification of proteins is often determined following mass spectrometric analysis of one or more of their constituent peptides. However, in order for quantification to be successful, it is important that the experimenter knows which peptides are readily detectable under the mass spectrometric conditions used for analysis. In this paper, genetic programming is used to develop a function which predicts the detectability of peptides from their calculated physico-chemical properties. Classification is carried out in two stages the selection of a good classifier using the AUROC objective function and the setting of an appropriate threshold. This allows the user to select the balance point between conflicting priorities in an intuitive way. The success of this method is found to be highly dependent on the initial selection of input parameters. The use of brood recombination and a modified version of the multi-objective FOCUS method are also investigated.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16373|IJCAI|2007|Learning User Clicks in Web Search|Machine learning for predicting user clicks in Web-based search offers automated explanation of user activity.

A case study of visuo-motor sequence learning is presented. The set of cognitive states we are interested in detecting are whether the subject has learnt a sequence, and if the subject is paying attention only towards the position or towards both the color and position of the visual stimuli.

We also study the polysize model property for epistemic logic programs. Based on these discoveries, we identify two non-trivial classes of epistemic logic programs whose consistency checking complexity is reduced from PSPACE-complete to NP-complete and P -complete respectively. We observe that many important applications on epistemic representation fall into these two classes of epistemic logic programs.|Yan Zhang"],["57966|GECCO|2007|Discovering structures in gene regulatory networks using genetic programming and particle swarms|In this paper, we describe a Genetic Programming and Particle Swarm Hybrid algorithm for Gene Network discovery.|Xinye Cai,Stephen Welch,Praveen Koduru,Sanjoy Das","58132|GECCO|2007|Self-modifying cartesian genetic programming|In nature, systems with enormous numbers of components (i.e. cells) are evolved from a relatively small genotype.

However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method. In addition to that, the threshold ai is also evolved by mutation between i - aisi, i + aisi in every generation in order to obtain as many association rules as possible. The features of the proposed method are as follows compared with other methods ) Extracts rules without identifying frequent itemsets used in Apriori-like mining methods. ) Stores extracted important association rules in a pool all together through generations. ) Measures the significance of associations via the chi-squared test. ) Extracts important rules sufficient enough for user's purpose in a short time. ) The pool is updated in every generation and only important association rules with higher chi-squared value are stored when the identical rules are stored. We have evaluated the proposed method by doing two simulations. Simulation  uses fixed threshold values that is, they remain fixed at initial thresholds during evolution. In simulation ,thresholds are evolved by mutation in every generation. Fig.  shows the number of rules extracted in the pool in simulation . It is found that the number of rules extracted has been increased, which means simulation  outperforms simulation .|Karla Taboada,Kaoru Shimada,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","16663|IJCAI|2007|QuantMiner A Genetic Algorithm for Mining Quantitative Association Rules|In this paper, we propose QUANTMINER, a mining quantitative association rules system.

The agents are controlled by a new kind of computational network based on a compartmentalised model of neurons. We have taken the view that the genetic basis of neurons is an important  and neglected aspect of previous approaches. Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents. Our results show that both agents exhibit interesting learning capabilities.|Gul Muhammad Khan,Julian Francis Miller,David M.

GNP is an evolutionary computation, which represents its solutions using graph structures and has some useful features inherently. It has been clarified that GNP works well especially in dynamic environments since GNP can create quite compact programs and has an implicit memory function. In this paper, GNP is applied to creating a stock trading model. There are three important points The first important point is to combine GNP with Sarsa Learning which is one of the reinforcement learning algorithms. Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of  brands in ,  and . Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in . From the simulation results, it is clarified that the trading rules of the proposed method obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method and its effectiveness has been confirmed.|Yan Chen,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","57893|GECCO|2007|A data parallel approach to genetic programming using programmable graphics hardware|In recent years the computing power of graphics cards has increased significantly.

Domain knowledge about the conditional independence relationships among variables can help learning of the Bayesian Network structure. This paper considers a different type of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian Networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that comes in the form of inequality constraints among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian Network with known structure.

Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling.

However, prior functions are isolated problem instances that do not provide much intuition about the space of possible functions that is relevant to this distinction or the characteristics of the problem class that affect the relative success of these operators. Modularity is a ubiquitous and intuitive concept in design, engineering and optimisation, and can be used to produce functions that discriminate the ability of crossover from mutation. In this paper, we present a new approach to representing modular problems, which parameterizes the amount of modular structure that is present in the epistatic dependencies of the problem. This adjustable level of modularity can be used to give rise to tuneable discrimination of the ability of genetic algorithms with crossover versus mutation-only algorithms.|Rob Mills,Richard A.

In this paper, we propose a new method for compiling BNs into Multi-Linear Functions (MLFs) based on Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZBDDs), which are a graph-based representation of combinatorial item sets. Our method differs from the original approach of Darwiche et al., which encodes BNs into Conjunctive Normal Forms (CNFs) and then translates CNFs into factored MLFs. Our approach directly translates a BN into a set of factored MLFs using a ZBDD-based symbolic probability calculation. The MLF may have exponential computational complexity, but our ZBDD-based data structure provides a compact factored form of the MLF, and arithmetic operations can be executed in a time almost linear with the ZBDD size. In our method, it is not necessary to generate the MLF for the whole network, as we can extract MLFs for only part of the network related to the query, avoiding unnecessary calculation of redundant MLF terms. We present experimental results for some typical benchmark examples.

We establish that simply requiring learned hypotheses to be consistent with observed values suffices to guarantee that hidden values are recoverable to a certain accuracy we also show that, in some sense, this is an optimal strategy for achieving accurate recovery. We then establish that a number of natural concept classes, including all the classes of monotone formulas that are PAC learnable by monotone formulas, and the classes of conjunctions, disjunctions, k-CNF, k-DNF, and linear thresholds, are consistently learnable from partial observations. We finally show that the concept classes of parities and monotone term -decision lists are not properly consistently learnable from partial observations, if RP  NP.

To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate.

Furthermore, we analyse how the conflict measure in this theory offers a way to favour particular diagnoses above others. This enables us to add uncertainty reasoning to consistency-based diagnosis in a seamless fashion.|Ildik√≥ Flesch,Peter J. F.
