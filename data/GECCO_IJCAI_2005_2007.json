We show that this extension enables the solution of a larger class of problems than can be solved by the original TD networks or by history-based methods alone. In addition, we apply TD networks to a problem that, while still simple, is significantly larger than has previously been considered.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

During the past decade, SVM has been commonly used as a classifier for various applications. The evolutionary computation has also attracted a lot of attention in pattern recognition and has shown significant performance improvement on a variety of applications. However, there has been no comparison of the two methods.

It is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. It requires less labeled data and it makes the test in a lower dimension, which speeds up the testing. Then, we provide a comprehensive comparison between SVM with different kernel functions and I-CFS-EM on several real datasets. This comparison shows that I-CFS-EM outperforms SVM in the sense of both the classification performance and the computational efficiency in the testing phase.

Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16121|IJCAI|2005|Image Retrieval and Disambiguation for Encyclopedic Web Search|To produce multimedia encyclopedic content, we propose a method to search the Web for images associated with a specific word sense.

Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain.

To address this challenge, we present two new techniques. The first approximates in the value space to obtain solutions efficiently for a pre-specified error bound.

Our second technique prunes large tracts of belief space that are unreachable, allowing faster policy computation without any sacrifice in optimality. The combination of the two techniques, which are complementary to existing optimal policy generation algorithms, provides solutions with tight error bounds efficiently in domains where competing algorithms fail to provide such tight bounds.|Pradeep Varakantham,Rajiv T.

Actually, this weighting method does not leverage the information implicitly contained in the categorization task to represent documents.

Recently, it is also used for multi-instance (MI) learning by employing a kernel that is defined directly on the bags. As only the bags (but not the instances) have known labels, this MI kernel implicitly assumes all instances in the bag to be equally important. However, a fundamental property of MI learning is that not all instances in a positive bag necessarily belong to the positive class, and thus different instances in the same bag should have different contributions to the kernel. In this paper, we address this instance label ambiguity by using the method of marginalized kernels. It first assumes that all the instance labels are available and defines a label-dependent kernel on the instances. By integrating out the unknown instance labels, a marginalized kernel defined on the bags can then be obtained. A desirable property is that this kernel weights the instance pairs by the consistencies of their probabilistic instance labels. Experiments on both classification and regression data sets show that this marginalized MI kernel, when used in a standard SVM, performs consistently better than the original MI kernel. It also outperforms a number of traditional MI learning methods.|James T.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design.

Performance on a job-shop scheduling problem is evaluated empirically with and without gene libraries, and with many different library configurations. We propose that gene libraries encourage diversity in a population of solutions and that the number of components in the gene library parameterises this effect. The number of gene libraries used is found to affect solution fitness and indeed using larger numbers of libraries (and therefore libraries of smaller components) enables higher fitness to be attained. We conclude that gene libraries are likely to be of use in applications where there is a need to maintain the diversity of solutions.|Peter Spellward,Tim Kovacs","57354|GECCO|2005|An artificial immune network for multimodal function optimization on dynamic environments|Multimodal optimization algorithms inspired by the immune system are generally characterized by a dynamic control of the population size and by diversity maintenance along the search.

Firstly, challenging benchmark problems in static multimodal optimization are considered to validate the new proposal. No parameter adjustment is necessary to adapt the algorithm according to the peculiarities of each problem.

The first, anergy, has been subject to the intense focus of immunologists as a possible key to autoimmune disease. The second is danger theory, which has attracted much interest as a possible alternative to traditional self-nonself selection models.We adopt a published immunological model, validate and extend it. Using the same calculations and assumptions as the original model, we integrate danger theory into the software.Without anergy, both models - the original and the danger model - produce similar results. When anergy is added, both models' performance improves. However, there seems to be some synergy between the mechanisms anergy has a greater effect on the danger model than the original model.

We believe that one reason (out of many) for this--one that has not heretofore been significantly exploited in the artificial vision literature--is that humans use a fovea to fixate on, or near an object, thus obtaining a very high resolution image of the object and rendering it easy to recognize. In this paper, we present a novel method for identifying and tracking objects in multiresolution digital video of partially cluttered environments. Our method is motivated by biological vision systems and uses a learned \"attentive\" interest map on a low resolution data stream to direct a high resolution \"fovea.\" Objects that are recognized in the fovea can then be tracked using peripheral vision. Because object recognition is run only on a small foveal image, our system achieves performance in real-time object recognition and tracking that is well beyond simpler systems.|Stephen Gould,Joakim Arfvidsson,Adrian Kaehler,Benjamin Sapp,Marius Messner,Gary R.

A seminal contribution in this area is the V-detectors algorithm that can very effectively cover the nonself region of the feature space with a set of detectors. The detector set can be used to detect anomalous inputs. In this paper, a multistage approach to create an effective set of V-detectors is considered. The first stage of the algorithm generates an initial set of V-detectors. In subsequent stage, new detectors are grown from existing ones, by means of a mechanism called procreation. Procreating detectors can more effectively fill hard-to-reach interstices in the nonself region, resulting in better coverage. The effectiveness of the algorithm is first illustrated by applying it to a well-known fractal, the Koch curve. The algorithm is then applied to the problem of detecting anomalous behavior in power distribution systems, and can be of much use for maintenance-related decision-making in electrical utility companies.|Min Gui,Sanjoy Das,Anil Pahwa","58016|GECCO|2007|An artificial immune system with partially specified antibodies|Artificial Immune System algorithms use antibodies which fully specify the solution of an optimization, learning, or pattern recognition problem.

The evolutionary white-box testing is a promising approach for the complete automation of structure-oriented test case generation. Here, test case generation can be completely automated with the help of evolutionary algorithms. However, problem cases exist in which the evolutionary test is not able to find valid test data.

In this paper, we propose the Genetic Algorithm with Local Filtering (GALF) to address the problem, which combines and utilizes both position-led and consensus-led representations in present GA approaches. While position-led representation provides flexibility to move around the search space, it is likely to contain some \"false positive\" sites within an individual. This problem can be overcome by our local filtering operator, which employs consensus-led representation, while it needs less computation than alignments used in conventional consensus-led approaches. Thus both efficiency and accuracy can be achieved.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16373|IJCAI|2007|Learning User Clicks in Web Search|Machine learning for predicting user clicks in Web-based search offers automated explanation of user activity.

Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

It is commonly asserted that in order to do so, the agent must be able to learn to deal with unexpected environmental conditions. However an ability to learn is not sufficient. For true extended autonomy, an agent must also be able to recognize when to abandon its current model in favor of learning a new one and how to learn in its current situation. This paper presents a fully implemented example of such autonomy in the context of color map learning on a vision-based mobile robot for the purpose of image segmentation. Past research established the ability of a robot to learn a color map in a single fixed lighting condition when manually given a \"curriculum,\" an action sequence designed to facilitate learning.

We propose a masking process model to capture the stochastic nature of information loss. Learning in this context is employed as a means to recover as much of the missing information as is recoverable. We extend the Probably Approximately Correct semantics to the case of learning from partial observations with arbitrarily hidden attributes. We establish that simply requiring learned hypotheses to be consistent with observed values suffices to guarantee that hidden values are recoverable to a certain accuracy we also show that, in some sense, this is an optimal strategy for achieving accurate recovery. We then establish that a number of natural concept classes, including all the classes of monotone formulas that are PAC learnable by monotone formulas, and the classes of conjunctions, disjunctions, k-CNF, k-DNF, and linear thresholds, are consistently learnable from partial observations. We finally show that the concept classes of parities and monotone term -decision lists are not properly consistently learnable from partial observations, if RP  NP. This implies a separation of what is consistently learnable from partial observations versus what is learnable in the complete or noisy setting.|Loizos Michael","16373|IJCAI|2007|Learning User Clicks in Web Search|Machine learning for predicting user clicks in Web-based search offers automated explanation of user activity. We address click prediction in the Web search scenario by introducing a method for click prediction based on observations of past queries and the clicked documents. Due to the sparsity of the problem space, commonly encountered when learning for Web search, new approaches to learn the probabilistic relationship between documents and queries are proposed. Two probabilistic models are developed, which differ in the interpretation of the query-document co-occurrences. A novel technique, namely, conditional probability hierarchy, flexibly adjusts the level of granularity in parsing queries, and, as a result, leverages the advantages of both models.|Ding Zhou,Levent Bolelli,Jia Li,C.

We consider the inverse problem of detecting the cognitive state of a human subject based on the fMRI data. We have explored classification techniques such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machines. In order to reduce the very high dimensional fMRI data, we have used three feature selection strategies. Discriminating features and activity based features were used to select features for the problem of identifying the instantaneous cognitive state given a single fMRI scan and correlation based features were used when fMRI data from a single time interval was given. A case study of visuo-motor sequence learning is presented. The set of cognitive states we are interested in detecting are whether the subject has learnt a sequence, and if the subject is paying attention only towards the position or towards both the color and position of the visual stimuli. We have successfully used correlation based features to detect position-color related cognitive states with % accuracy and the cognitive states related to learning with .% accuracy.|Vishwajeet Singh,Krishna P.

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a ,, Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of % on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TEXTRUNNER's ,, highest probability tuples, and show that they contain over ,, concrete facts and over ,, more abstract assertions.|Michele Banko,Michael J.

The system observes content-selection choices that users make and builds a predictive model that could, for example, be used to generate an initial draft report. Using a feature of the interface the system also collects information about potential user-specific features. The system was evaluated under realistic conditions, by collecting data in a project-based university course where student group leaders were tasked with preparing weekly reports for the benefit of the instructors, using the material from individual student reports. This paper addresses the question of whether data derived from the implicit supervision provided by end-users is robust enough to support not only model parameter tuning but also a form of feature discovery. Results indicate that this is the case system performance improves based on the feedback from user activity. We find that individual learned models (and features) are user-specific, although not completely idiosyncratic. Thismay suggest that approaches which seek to optimizemodels globally (say over a large corpus of data) may not in fact produce results acceptable to all individuals.|Mohit Kumar,Nikesh Garera,Alexander I.

Fundamentally, the method clusters similar entity pairs according to their collective contexts in Web documents. The descriptive labels for relations are obtained from results of clustering. The proposed method is entirely unsupervised and is easily incorporated with existing social network extraction methods.

In contrast to GA's, PC-based methods do not update populations of solutions. Instead they update an explicitly parameterized probability distribution p over the space of solutions. That updating of p arises as the optimization of a functional of p. The functional is chosen so that any p that optimizes it should be p peaked about good solutions. The PC approach has deep connections with both game theory and statistical physics. We review the PC approach using its motivation as the information theoretic formulation of bounded rationality for multi-agent systems (MAS). It is then compared with GA's on a diverse set of problems. To handle high dimensional surfaces, in the PC method investigated here p is restricted to a product distribution. Each distribution in that product is controlled by a separate agent. The test functions were selected for their difficulty using either traditional gradient descent or genetic algorithms. On those functions the PC-based approach significantly outperforms traditional GA's in both rate of descent, trapping in false minima, and long term optimization.|Chien-Feng Huang,Stefan Bieniawski,David H.

We propose that gene libraries encourage diversity in a population of solutions and that the number of components in the gene library parameterises this effect. The number of gene libraries used is found to affect solution fitness and indeed using larger numbers of libraries (and therefore libraries of smaller components) enables higher fitness to be attained.

The objective is to observe a goal-directed agent and to select assistive actions in order to minimize the overall cost. We model the problem as an assistant POMDP where the hidden state corresponds to the agent's unobserved goals. This formulation allows us to exploit domain models for both estimating the agent's goals and selecting assistive action. In addition, the formulation naturally handles uncertainty, varying action costs, and customization to specific agents via learning.

This method provides smooth class probabilities estimate, without any modification of the tree, when the data are numerical. It applies a posteriori and doesn't use additional training cases. It relies on the distance to the decision boundary induced by the decision tree. The distance is computed on the training sample. It is then used as an input for a very simple one-dimension kernel-based density estimator, which provides an estimate of the class membership probability. This geometric method gives good results even with pruned trees, so the intelligibility of the tree is fully preserved.|Isabelle Alvarez,Stephan Bernard,Guillaume Deffuant","57531|GECCO|2005|Evolving fuzzy decision tree structure that adapts in real-time|A fuzzy logic algorithm has been developed that automatically allocates electronic attack (EA) resources distributed over different platforms in real-time. The controller must be able to make decisions based on rules provided by experts. The fuzzy logic approach allows the direct incorporation of expertise. Genetic algorithm based optimization is conducted to determine the form of the membership functions for the fuzzy root concepts. The resource manager is made up of five parts, the isolated platform model, the multi-platform model, the fuzzy EA model, the fuzzy parameter selection tree and the fuzzy strategy tree. Automatic determination of fuzzy decision tree topology using a genetic program, an algorithm that creates other algorithms is discussed.

In algebraic MDPs, rewards are expressed in a semiring structure, uncertainty is represented by a decomposable plausibility measure valued on a second semiring structure, and preferences over policies are represented by Generalized Expected Utility. We recast the problem of finding an optimal policy at a finite horizon as an algebraic path problem in a decision rule graph where arcs are valued by functions, which justifies the use of the Jacobi algorithm to solve algebraic Bellman equations. In order to show the potential of this general approach, we exhibit new variations of MDPs, admitting complete or partial preference structures, as well as probabilistic or possibilistic representation of uncertainty.|Patrice Perny,Olivier Spanjaard,Paul Weng","16409|IJCAI|2007|Topological Value Iteration Algorithm for Markov Decision Processes|Value Iteration is an inefficient algorithm for Markov decision processes (MDPs) because it puts the majority of its effort into backing up the entire state space, which turns out to be unnecessary in many cases. In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal. Our experimental results show that TVI outperforms VI, LAO, LRTDP and HDP on our benchmark MDPs.|Peng Dai,Judy Goldsmith","16367|IJCAI|2007|A Fast Analytical Algorithm for Solving Markov Decision Processes with Real-Valued Resources|Agents often have to construct plans that obey deadlines or, more generally, resource limits for real-valued resources whose consumption can only be characterized by probability distributions, such as execution time or battery power. These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.|Janusz Marecki,Sven Koenig,Milind Tambe","16759|IJCAI|2007|Using Linear Programming for Bayesian Exploration in Markov Decision Processes|A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge. Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming.

Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents.

However, the topological structure of a system may set a limit on the possible robustness achievable through parameter tuning.

As a case study, a methodology for automated synthesis of dynamic systems, based on genetic programming and bond graph modeling (GPBG), is applied to evolve robust low-pass and high-pass analog filters. Compared with a traditional robust design approach based on a state-of-the-art real-parameter genetic algorithm (GA), it is shown that open-ended topology search by genetic programming with a fitness criterion rewarding robustness can evolve more robust systems with respect to parameter perturbations than what was achieved through parameter tuning alone, for our test problems.|Jianjun Hu,Xiwei Zhong,Erik D.

However, in order for quantification to be successful, it is important that the experimenter knows which peptides are readily detectable under the mass spectrometric conditions used for analysis. In this paper, genetic programming is used to develop a function which predicts the detectability of peptides from their calculated physico-chemical properties. Classification is carried out in two stages the selection of a good classifier using the AUROC objective function and the setting of an appropriate threshold. This allows the user to select the balance point between conflicting priorities in an intuitive way. The success of this method is found to be highly dependent on the initial selection of input parameters. The use of brood recombination and a modified version of the multi-objective FOCUS method are also investigated.

With respect to EAs, such analyses have been essential to develop methods for the analysis on more complicated problems.
