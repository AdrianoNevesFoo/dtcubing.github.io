However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction. Simple examples are given in order to show the advantages of the algorithm.|Marc G.

In this paper, we extend TD networks by allowing the network-update process (answer network) to depend on the recent history of previous actions and observations rather than only on the most recent action and observation. We show that this extension enables the solution of a larger class of problems than can be solved by the original TD networks or by history-based methods alone. In addition, we apply TD networks to a problem that, while still simple, is significantly larger than has previously been considered. We show that history-extended TD networks can learn much of the common-sense knowledge of an egocentric gridworld domain with a single bit of perception.|Brian Tanner,Richard S.

The backtrack algorithms that maintain some local consistency during search have become the de facto standard to solve CSPs. Maintaining higher levels of consistency, generally, reduces the search effort. However, due to ineffective constraint propagation, it often penalises the search algorithm in terms of time. If we can reduce ineffective constraint propagation, then the effectiveness of a search algorithm can be enhanced significantly. In order to do so, we use a probabilistic approach to resolve when to propagate and when not to. The idea is to perform only the useful consistency checking by not seeking a support when there is a high probability that a support exists. The idea of probabilistic support inference is general and can be applied to any kind of local consistency algorithm. However, we shall study its impact with respect to arc consistency and singleton arc consistency (SAC). Experimental results demonstrate that enforcing probabilistic SAC almost always enforces SAC, but it requires significantly less time than SAC. Likewise, maintaining probabilistic arc consistency and maintaining probabilistic SAC require significantly less time than maintaining arc consistency and maintaining SAC.|Deepak Mehta,Marc R.

Hence, multi-core processors that provide high aggregate processing capacity are ideal matches for executing costly DSMS operators. The recently developed Cell processor is a good example of a heterogeneous multi-core architecture and provides a powerful platform for executing data stream operators with high-performance. On the down side, exploiting the full potential of a multi-core processor like Cell is often challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous nature of the processing elements, the software managed local memory at the co-processor side, and the unconventional programming model in general. In this paper, we study the problem of scalable execution of windowed stream join operators on multi-core processors, and specifically on the Cell processor. By examining various aspects of join execution flow, we determine the right set of techniques to apply in order to minimize the sequential segments and maximize parallelism. Concretely, we show that basic windows coupled with low-overhead pointer-shifting techniques can be used to achieve efficient join window partitioning, column-oriented join window organization can be used to minimize scattered data transfers, delay-optimized double buffering can be used for effective pipelining, rate-aware batching can be used to balance join throughput and tuple delay, and finally SIMD (single-instruction multiple-data) optimized operator code can be used to exploit data parallelism. Our experimental results show that, following the design guidelines and implementation techniques outlined in this paper, windowed stream joins can achieve high scalability (linear in the number of co-processors) by making efficient use of the extensive hardware parallelism provided by the Cell processor (reaching data processing rates of &ap  GBsec) and significantly surpass the performance obtained form conventional high-end processors (supporting a combined input stream rate of  tuplessec using  minutes windows and without dropping any tuples, resulting in &ap . times higher output rate compared to an SSE implementation on dual .Ghz Intel Xeon).|Bugra Gedik,Philip S.

However, query operators that work with multiple streams, such as stream merge or join, can often still block if one of the input stream is very slow or bursty. In principle, punctuation and heartbeat mechanisms have been proposed to unblock streaming operators. In practice, it is a challenge to incorporate such mechanisms into a high-performance stream management system that is operational in an industrial application.In this paper, we introduce a system for punctuation-carrying heartbeat generation that we developed for Gigascope, a high-performance streaming database for network monitoring, that is operationally used within AT&T's IP backbone. We show how heartbeats can be regularly generated by low-level nodes in query execution plans and propagated upward unblocking all streaming operators on its way. Additionally, our heartbeat mechanism can be used for other applications in distributed settings such as detecting node failures, performance monitoring, and query optimization. A performance evaluation using live data feeds shows that our system is capable of working at multiple Gigabit line speeds in a live, industrial deployment and can significantly decrease the query memory utilization.|Theodore Johnson,S.

In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

We also propose a hybrid scheduling policy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs.

TopX addresses these issues by precomputing score and path information in an appropriately designed index structure, by largely avoiding or postponing the evaluation of expensive path conditions so as to preserve the sequential access pattern on index lists, and by selectively scheduling random accesses when they are cost-beneficial. In addition, TopX can compute approximate top-k results using probabilistic score estimators, thus speeding up queries with a small and controllable loss in retrieval precision.|Martin Theobald,Ralf Schenkel,Gerhard Weikum","80772|VLDB|2007|Unifying Data and Domain Knowledge Using Virtual Views|The database community is on a constant quest for better integration of data management and knowledge management.

Because the virtual view is in the relational format, users can query the data and the knowledge in a seamlessly integrated manner. To facilitate knowledge representation and inferencing within the database engine, our approach leverages XML support in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server & IBM DB  PureXML).

As in relational cost estimation, COMET exploits a set of system catalog statistics that summarizes the XML data the set of \"simple path\" statistics that we propose is new, and is well suited to the XML setting. Unlike the traditional approach, COMET uses a new statistical learning technique called \"transform regression\" instead of detailed analytical models to predict the overall cost. Besides rendering the cost estimation problem tractable for XML queries, COMET has the further advantage of enabling the query optimizer to be self-tuning, automatically adapting to changes over time in the query workload and in the system environment. We demonstrate COMET's feasibility by developing a cost model for the recently proposed XNAV navigational operator. Empirical studies with synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets show that COMET can quickly obtain accurate cost estimates for a variety of XML queries and data sets.|Ning Zhang 0002,Peter J.

The pattern language features optional nodes and nesting, allowing to capture the data needs of nested XQueries. The language also allows describing storage features such as structural identifiers, which enlarge the space of rewritings. We study pattern containment and equivalent rewriting under the constraints expressed in a structural summary, whose enhanced form also entails integrity constraints.

Under this framework, finding the right sense for a given word amounts to identifying the most \"important\" node among the set of graph nodes representing its senses.

However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) of the time series, the similarity search over directly indexed time series usually encounters a serious problem, known as the \"dimensionality curse\". Thus, many dimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing the dimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods, only Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries, which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initial studies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods, however, show that PLA performs no worse than others. Motivated by this, in this paper, we re-investigate PLA for approximating and indexing time series. Specifically, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced PLA-space, and prove that this function indeed results in a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original time series, which can lead to no false dismissals during the similarity search. As a second step, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds to improve the search efficiency. Our extensive experiments over a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data sets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of PLA together with the newly proposed lower bound distance, in terms of both pruning power and wall clock time, compared with two state-of-the-art reduction methods, Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA) and Chebyshev Polynomials (CP).|Qiuxia Chen,Lei Chen 0002,Xiang Lian,Yunhao Liu,Jeffrey Xu Yu","16122|IJCAI|2005|Feature Generation for Text Categorization Using World Knowledge|We enhance machine learning algorithms for text categorization with generated features based on domain-specific and common-sense knowledge. This knowledge is represented using publicly available ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, such as the Open Directory these ontologies are further enriched by several orders of magnitude through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the documents alone. Experimental results confirm improved performance, breaking through the plateau previously reached in the field.|Evgeniy Gabrilovich,Shaul Markovitch","16726|IJCAI|2007|Combining Learning and Word Sense Disambiguation for Intelligent User Profiling|Understanding user interests from text documents can provide support to personalized information recommendation services. Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16121|IJCAI|2005|Image Retrieval and Disambiguation for Encyclopedic Web Search|To produce multimedia encyclopedic content, we propose a method to search the Web for images associated with a specific word sense.

Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

Given the pattern V -NP-P-NP in the text, where V is verb, NP is a noun phrase, P is the preposition and NP is the other noun phrase, the question asked is where does P - NP attach V or NP This question is typically answered using both the word and the world knowledge. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution. Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach. The unambiguous V - P - N and N - P -N tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N - P - N tuples of the test corpus. A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation (WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of Vs and Ns in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP, NP - P - NP. For experimentation, Brown Corpus provides the training data andWall Street Journal Corpus the test data. The accuracy obtained for PP-attachment resolution is close to %.

Based on this semantics, XML fragments that look meaningful to a keyword-based query are effectively retrieved by the operations defined in the model. In contrast to earlier work, our model supports filters for restricting the size of a query result, which otherwise may contain a large number of potentially irrelevant fragments. We introduce a class of filters having a special property that enables significant reduction in query processing cost. Many practically useful filters fall in this class and hence, the proposed model can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents. Several other issues regarding algebraic manipulation of the operations defined in our query model are also formally discussed.|Sujeet Pradhan","16733|IJCAI|2007|Planning with Goal Utility Dependencies|Work in partial satisfaction planning (PSP) has hitherto assumed that goals are independent thus implying that they have additive utility values.

To guide the forward planning search, we introduce a novel heuristic framework that combines costpropagation and Integer Programming to select beneficial goals to find an informative heuristic estimate. The two implemented planners, iPUD and SPUDS, using the approaches discussed above, are compared empirically on several benchmark domains. While iPUD is more readily amendable to handle goal utility dependencies and can provide bounded optimality guarantees, SPUDS scales much better.|Minh Binh Do,J.

The present paper presents SAYU-VISTA, an algorithm which advances beyond the initial view learning approach in three ways. First, it learns views that introduce new relational tables, rather than merely new fields for an existing table of the database. Second, new tables or new fields are not limited to being approximations to some target concept instead, the new approach performs a type of predicate invention. The new approach avoids the classical problem with predicate invention, of learning many useless predicates, by keeping only new fields or tables (i.e., new predicates) that immediately improve the performance of the statistical model. Third, retained fields or tables can then be used in the definitions of further new fields or tables.

Accordingly, neuronal recordings in the monkey striatum, the main basal ganglia structure, reveals two forms of plasticity during learning, a transient one that could constitute the neuronal correlate of the strategy, and a long-lasting one that could reflect the slow neuronal implementation of individual associations. Existing models of basal ganglia function based on reinforcement learning cannot account for this dual process. Hence, we developed a mathematical model of conditional visuomotor learning, inspired from viability theory, which implements both the formation of individual associations and the use of strategies to organize learning.|Fadila Hadj-Bouziane,HÃ©lÃ¨ne Frankowska,Martine Meunier,Driss Boussaoud","16474|IJCAI|2007|Kernel Carpentry for Online Regression Using Randomly Varying Coefficient Model|We present a Bayesian formulation of locally weighted learning (LWL) using the novel concept of a randomly varying coefficient model.

Typically, they automate important business tasks by orchestrating a number of applications and data stores. Obviously, the performance of a business process is directly dependent on the efficiency of data access, data processing, and data management. In this paper, we propose a framework for the optimization of data processing in business processes. We introduce a set of rewrite rules that transform a business process in such a way that an improved execution with respect to data management can be achieved without changing the semantics of the original process. These rewrite rules are based on a semi-procedural process graph model that externalizes data dependencies as well as control flow dependencies of a business process. Furthermore, we present a multi-stage control strategy for the optimization process. We illustrate the benefits and opportunities of our approach through a prototype implementation. Our experimental results demonstrate that independent of the underlying database system performance gains of orders of magnitude are achievable by reasoning about data and control in a unified framework.|Marko Vrhovnik,Holger Schwarz,Oliver Suhre,Bernhard Mitschang,Volker Markl,Albert Maier,Tobias Kraft","16093|IJCAI|2005|Learning Forward Models for Robots|Forward models enable a robot to predict the effects of its actions on its own motor system and its environment.

In this paper, we propose a unified approach to these two problems that dynamically models the objects to be manipulated and localizes the robot at the same time. Our approach applies in the common setting where only a lowresolution (cm) grid-map of a building is available, but we also have a high-resolution (.cm) model of the object to be manipulated. Our method is based on defining a unifying probabilistic model over these two representations. The resulting algorithm works in real-time, and estimates the position of objects with sufficient precision for manipulation tasks. We apply our approach to the task of navigating from one office to another (including manipulating doors). Our approach, successfully tested on multiple doors, allows the robot to navigate through a hallway to an office door, grasp and turn the door handle, and continuously manipulate the door as it moves into the office.|Anna Petrovskaya,Andrew Y.

In this framework an accurate but slow reconstruction of the D scene is not needed rather, it is more important to have a fast localization of the obstacles to avoid them. All the methods in the literature are based on a punctual correspondence, but they are inefficient in realistic contexts for the presence of uniform patterns, or some perturbations between the two images of the stereo pair. Our idea is to face the stereo matching problem as a matching between homologous regions, instead of a point matching. The stereo images are represented as graphs and a graph matching is computed to find homologous regions. We present some results on a standard stereo database and also on a more realistic stereo sequence acquired from a robot moving in an indoor environment, and a performance comparison with other approaches in the literature is reported and discussed. Our method is strongly robust in case of some fluctuations of the stereo pair, homogeneous and repetitive regions, and is fast. The result is a semi-dense disparity map, leaving only a few regions in the scene unmatched.|Pasquale Foggia,Jean-Michel Jolion,Alessandro Limongiello,Mario Vento","16142|IJCAI|2005|Real-Time Path Planning for Humanoid Robot Navigation|We present a data structure and an algorithm for real-time path planning of a humanoid robot.

Yet in many cases structural information is available and can be used to match such data. As a running example we use residential address information. Addresses are hierarchical structures and are present in many databases. Often they are the best, if not only, relationship between autonomous data sources. Typically the matching has to be approximate since the representations in the sources differ.We propose pq-grams to approximately match hierarchical information from autonomous sources. We define the pq-gram distance between ordered labeled trees as an effective and efficient approximation of the well-known tree edit distance. We analyze the properties of the pq-gram distance and compare it with the edit distance and alternative approximations.

In order to reduce the very high dimensional fMRI data, we have used three feature selection strategies.

A case study of visuo-motor sequence learning is presented. The set of cognitive states we are interested in detecting are whether the subject has learnt a sequence, and if the subject is paying attention only towards the position or towards both the color and position of the visual stimuli.

At first, we consider for a multidimensional data set P the problem of dynamic skyline queries according to a query point q. This kind of dynamic skyline corresponds to the skyline of a transformed data space where point q becomes the origin and all points of P are represented by their distance vector to q. The reverse skyline query returns the objects whose dynamic skyline contains the query object q. In order to compute the reverse skyline of an arbitrary query point, we first propose a Branch and Bound algorithm (called BBRS), which is an improved customization of the original BBS algorithm. Furthermore, we identify a super set of the reverse skyline that is used to bound the search space while computing the reverse skyline. To further reduce the computational cost of determining if a point belongs to the reverse skyline, we propose an enhanced algorithm (called RSSA) that is based on accurate pre-computed approximations of the skylines. These approximations are used to identify whether a point belongs to the reverse skyline or not. Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets, we show that our algorithms can efficiently support reverse skyline queries. Our enhanced approach improves reversed skyline processing by up to an order of magnitude compared to the algorithm without the usage of pre-computed approximations.|Evangelos Dellis,Bernhard Seeger","16303|IJCAI|2005|Beyond TFIDF Weighting for Text Categorization in the Vector Space Model|KNN and SVM are two machine learning approaches to Text Categorization (TC) based on the Vector Space Model. In this model, borrowed from Information Retrieval, documents are represented as a vector where each component is associated with a particular word from the vocabulary. Traditionally, each component value is assigned using the information retrieval TFIDF measure. While this weighting method seems very appropriate for IR, it is not clear that it is the best choice for TC problems. Actually, this weighting method does not leverage the information implicitly contained in the categorization task to represent documents. In this paper, we introduce a new weighting method based on statistical estimation of the importance of a word for a specific categorization problem. This method also has the benefit to make feature selection implicit, since useless features for the categorization problem considered get a very small weight. Extensive experiments reported in the paper shows that this new weighting method improves significantly the classification accuracy as measured on many categorization tasks.|Pascal Soucy,Guy W.

In this paper, we propose a much simpler approach based on multiplicative updates. This idea was first explored in Cristianini et al., , but its convergence is sensitive to a learning rate that has to be fixed manually. Moreover, the update rule only works for the hard-margin SVM, which is known to have poor performance on noisy data. In this paper, we show that the multiplicative update of SVM can be formulated as a Bregman projection problem, and the learning rate can then be adapted automatically. Moreover, because of the connection between boosting and Bregman distance, we show that this multiplicative update for SVM can be regarded as boosting the (weighted) Parzen window classifiers. Motivated by the success of boosting, we then consider the use of an adaptive ensemble of the partially trained SVMs. Extensive experiments show that the proposed multiplicative update rule with an adaptive learning rate leads to faster and more stable convergence. Moreover, the proposed ensemble has efficient training and comparable or even better accuracy than the best-tuned soft-margin SVM.|Ivor W. Tsang,James T.

Recently, it is also used for multi-instance (MI) learning by employing a kernel that is defined directly on the bags. As only the bags (but not the instances) have known labels, this MI kernel implicitly assumes all instances in the bag to be equally important. However, a fundamental property of MI learning is that not all instances in a positive bag necessarily belong to the positive class, and thus different instances in the same bag should have different contributions to the kernel. In this paper, we address this instance label ambiguity by using the method of marginalized kernels. It first assumes that all the instance labels are available and defines a label-dependent kernel on the instances. By integrating out the unknown instance labels, a marginalized kernel defined on the bags can then be obtained. A desirable property is that this kernel weights the instance pairs by the consistencies of their probabilistic instance labels. Experiments on both classification and regression data sets show that this marginalized MI kernel, when used in a standard SVM, performs consistently better than the original MI kernel. It also outperforms a number of traditional MI learning methods.|James T.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design. Our contribution is the introduction of a general technique for designing SVM kernels tailored for the classification of sequence data.|Young-In Shin,Donald S.

However pathological cases may deviate substantially from generic knowledge. We propose a method to adapt the knowledge representation to take into account the influence of the pathologies on the spatial organization of a set of structures, based on learning procedures.

More recent work, however, has begun to address the need for spatial data types describing spatial phenomena that cannot be modeled by objects having sharp boundaries. Other work has focused on point objects whose location is not precisely known and is typically described using a probability distribution. In this paper, we present a new technique for modeling and querying vague spatial objects. Using shapelets, an image decomposition technique developed in astronomy, as base data type, we introduce a comprehensive set of low-level operations that provide building blocks for versatile high-level operations on vague spatial objects. In addition, we describe an implementation of this data model as an extension to PostgreSQL, including an indexing technique for shapelet objects. Unlike existing techniques for modeling and querying vague or fuzzy data, our approach is optimized for localized, smoothly varying spatial objects, and as such is more suitable for many real-world datasets.|Daniel Zinn,Jim Bosch,Michael Gertz"],["80730|VLDB|2007|Probabilistic Graphical Models and their Role in Databases|Probabilistic graphical models provide a framework for compact representation and efficient reasoning about the joint probability distribution of several interdependent variables.

So far much of the research has been focused on English due to the lack of semantically annotated resources in other languages. In this paper, we report first results on semantic role labeling using a pre-release version of the Chinese Proposition Bank. Since the Chinese Proposition Bank is superimposed on top of the Chinese Tree-bank, i.e., the semantic role labels are assigned to constituents in a treebank parse tree, we start by reporting results on experiments using the handcrafted parses in the treebank. This will give us a measure of the extent to which the semantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation in the treebank. We will then report experiments using a fully automatic Chinese parser that integrates word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing. This will gauge how successful semantic role labeling can be done for Chinese in realistic situations. We show that our results using hand-crafted parses are slightly higher than the results reported for the state-of-the-art semantic role labeling systems for English using the Penn English Proposition Bank data, even though the Chinese Proposition Bank is smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our system is much lower than the English state-of-the-art. This reveals an interesting cross-linguistic difference between the two languages, which we attempt to explain. We also describe a method to induce verb classes from the Proposition Bank \"frame files\" that can be used to improve semantic role labeling.|Nianwen Xue,Martha Stone Palmer","80627|VLDB|2006|Globalization Challenges to Database Community|Globalization is flattening the world.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16121|IJCAI|2005|Image Retrieval and Disambiguation for Encyclopedic Web Search|To produce multimedia encyclopedic content, we propose a method to search the Web for images associated with a specific word sense.

Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples.

The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names.

In this paper we show that local search techniques can effectively exploit information about problem structure producing significant improvements in performance on structured problem instances. Building on the earlier work of Ostrowski et al. we describe how information about variable dependencies can be built into a local search, so that only independent variables are considered for flipping. The cost effect of a flip is then dynamically calculated using a dependency lattice that models dependent variables using gates (specifically and, or and equivalence gates). The experimental study on hard structured benchmark problems demonstrates that our new approach significantly outperforms the previously reported best local search techniques.|Duc Nghia Pham,John Thornton,Abdul Sattar","16401|IJCAI|2007|Forward Search Value Iteration for POMDPs|Recent scaling up of POMDP solvers towards realistic applications is largely due to point-based methods which quickly converge to an approximate solution formedium-sized problems.

Most existing work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem, which considers the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set of features. Such an approach has two drawbacks ) it leaves many partial similarities uncovered ) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the k-n-match problem in this paper.The k-n-match problem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the data objects in n dimensions, where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and these n dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objects returned in the answer set match best. The k-n-match query is expected to be superior to the kNN query in discovering partial similarities, however, it may not be as good in identifying full similarity since a single value of n may only correspond to a particular aspect of an object instead of the entirety. To address this problem, we further introduce the frequent k-n-match problem, which finds a set of objects that appears in the k-n-match answers most frequently for a range of n values. Moreover, we propose search algorithms for both problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of individual attributes retrieved, which is especially useful for information retrieval from multiple systems. We can also apply the proposed algorithmic strategy to achieve a disk based algorithm for the (frequent) k-n-match query. By a thorough experimental study using both real and synthetic data sets, we show that ) the k-n-match query yields better result than the kNN query in identifying similar objects by partial similarities ) our proposed method (for processing the frequent k-n-match query) outperforms existing techniques for similarity search in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.|Anthony K.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries. A thorough experimental study evaluates the efficiency of the proposed technique.|Gautam Das,Dimitrios Gunopulos,Nick Koudas,Nikos Sarkas","80587|VLDB|2005|Temporal Management of RFID Data|RFID technology can be used to significantly improve the efficiency of business processes by providing the capability of automatic identification and data capture.

Although much attention has been focused on XML as a tree data model, phylogenetic trees differ from document-oriented applications in their size and depth, and their need for structure-based queries rather than path-based queries.This paper focuses on Crimson, a tree storage system for phylogenetic trees used to evaluate phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms within the context of the NSF CIPRes project. A goal of the modeling component of the CIPRes project is to construct a huge simulation tree representing a \"gold standard\" of evolutionary history against which phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms can be tested.In this demonstration, we highlight our storage and indexing strategies and show how Crimson is used for benchmarking phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms.

One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

However, this model is not suitable for processing concurrent distributed queries because the foundation, the memory-disk hierarchy, does not exist for data provided by remote sources. Therefore, the query engine cannot exploit any data sharing so that each process will have to interact with data sources independently issue data requests and fetch data over the network. This paper presents Request Window, a novel DQP mechanism that can detect and employ data sharing opportunities across concurrent distributed queries. By combining multiple similar data requests issued to the same data source to a common data request, Request Window allows concurrent query executing processes to share the common result data. With the benefits of reduced source burdens and data transfers, the throughput of query engine can be significantly improved. This paper also introduces the IGNITE system, an extended PostgreSQL with DQP support. Our experimental results show that Request Window makes IGNITE achieve a .x speedup over a commercial data integration system when running a workload of distributed TPC-H queries.|Rubao Lee,Minghong Zhou,Huaming Liao","80834|VLDB|2007|Self-Organizing Schema Mappings in the GridVine Peer Data Management System|GridVine is a Peer Data Management System based on a decentralized access structure.

We show how optimizing such programs raises challenges specific to text data that cannot be accommodated in the current relational optimization framework, then provide initial solutions.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16467|IJCAI|2007|Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning as a Generative Model|This paper proposes and develops a new graph-based semi-supervised learning method.

Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions.

I showed how partitioning a roadmap into subgraphs of known structure allows us to first plan at a level of abstraction and then resolve these plans into concrete paths without the need for further search so we can solve significantly harder planning tasks with the same resources. However the subgraph types I introduced in that paper, stacks and cliques, are not likely to occur often in realistic planning problems and so are of limited usefulness. In this paper I describe a new kind of subgraph called a hall, which can also be used for planning and which occurs much more commonly in real problems. I explain its formal properties as a planning component and demonstrate its use on a map of the Patrick's container yard at the Port of Brisbane in Queensland Australia.|Malcolm R. K.

One approach to achieve required sensing coverage is to use robots to convey sensors within this space. Planning the motion of these robots - coordinating their paths in order to maximize the amount of information collected while placing bounds on their resources (e.g., path length or energy capacity) - is aNP-hard problem. In this paper, we present an efficient path planning algorithm that coordinates multiple robots, each having a resource constraint, to maximize the \"informativeness\" of their visited locations. In particular, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to characterize the amount of information collected. We provide strong theoretical approximation guarantees for our algorithm by exploiting the submodularity property of mutual information. In addition, we improve the efficiency of our approach by extending the algorithm using branch and bound and a region-based decomposition of the space. We provide an extensive empirical analysis of our algorithm, comparing with existing heuristics on datasets from several real world sensing applications.|Amarjeet Singh 0003,Andreas Krause,Carlos Guestrin,William J.

In that framework, agents adopt a goal when requested to do so (by some agent reqr), and they remain committed to the goal unless the request is cancelled by reqr. A common assumption in the agent theory literature, e.g., Cohen and Levesque,  Rao and Georgeff, , is that achievement goals that are believed to be impossible to achieve should be dropped. In this paper, we incorporate this assumption into Shapiro et al.'s framework, however we go a step further. If an agent believes a goal is impossible to achieve, it is dropped. However, if the agent later believes that it was mistaken about the impossibility of achieving the goal, the agent might readopt the goal. In addition, we consider an agent's goals as a whole when making them compatible with their beliefs, rather than considering them individually.|Steven Shapiro,Gerhard Brewka","16475|IJCAI|2007|Dynamic Mixture Models for Multiple Time-Series|Traditional probabilistic mixture models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation imply that data records (such as documents) are fully exchangeable.

Most temporal planners cope with this challenge by restricting action start times to a small set of decision epochs, because this enables search to be carried out in state-space and leverages powerful state-based reachability heuristics, originally developed for classical planning. Indeed, decision-epoch planners won the International Planning Competition's Temporal Planning Track in ,  and .

In order to characterize the cause of incompleteness, we identify the notion of required concurrency, which separates expressive temporal action languages from simple ones.

We conclude by designing a complete state-space temporal planning algorithm, which we hope will be able to achieve high performance by leveraging the heuristics that power decision epoch planners.|William Cushing,Subbarao Kambhampati,Mausam,Daniel S.

As in relational cost estimation, COMET exploits a set of system catalog statistics that summarizes the XML data the set of \"simple path\" statistics that we propose is new, and is well suited to the XML setting. Unlike the traditional approach, COMET uses a new statistical learning technique called \"transform regression\" instead of detailed analytical models to predict the overall cost. Besides rendering the cost estimation problem tractable for XML queries, COMET has the further advantage of enabling the query optimizer to be self-tuning, automatically adapting to changes over time in the query workload and in the system environment. We demonstrate COMET's feasibility by developing a cost model for the recently proposed XNAV navigational operator. Empirical studies with synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets show that COMET can quickly obtain accurate cost estimates for a variety of XML queries and data sets.|Ning Zhang 0002,Peter J.

It is therefore of utmost importance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate schemas from sets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on the inference of Document Type Definitions (DTDs for short), we will consider the inference of XML Schema Definitions (XSDs for short) --- the increasingly popular schema formalism that is turning DTDs obsolete. In contrast to DTDs where the content model of an element depends only on the element's name, the content model in an XSD can also depend on the context in which the element is used. Hence, while the inference of DTDs basically reduces to the inference of regular expressions from sets of sample strings, the inference of XSDs also entails identifying from a corpus of sample documents the contexts in which elements bear different content models. Since a seminal result by Gold implies that no inference algorithm can learn the complete class of XSDs from positive examples only, we focus on a class of XSDs that captures most XSDs occurring in practice. For this class, we provide a theoretically complete algorithm that always infers the correct XSD when a sufficiently large corpus of XML documents is available.

In this paper, information preservation for XML is formally studied, and the results of this study guide the definition of a novel notion of schema embedding between two XML DTD schemas represented as graphs. Schema embedding generalizes the conventional notion of graph similarity by allowing an edge in a source DTD schema to be mapped to a path in the target DTD. Instance-level embeddings can be defined from the schema embedding in a straightforward manner, such that conformance to a target schema and information preservation are guaranteed. We show that it is NP-complete to find an embedding between two DTD schemas. We also provide efficient heuristic algorithms to find candidate embeddings, along with experimental results to evaluate and compare the algorithms.

We also described one information-preserving mapping scheme, called Edge++, and showed that, under reasonable assumptions, losslessness and validation are both undecidable. This leads to the question we study in this paper how to design mapping schemes that are information-preserving. We propose to do it by starting with a scheme known to be information-preserving and applying to it equivalence-preserving transformations written in weakly recursive ILOG. We study an instance of this framework, the LILO algorithm, and show that it provides significant performance improvements over Edge++ and introduces constraints that are efficiently enforced in practice.|Denilson Barbosa,Juliana Freire,Alberto O.

The individual rules that compose the rule set also have higher support and stronger association indexes.|Ronaldo C. Prati,Peter A.

This measure is of great theoretical and practical importance as a tool for tasks such as model selection or data clustering. In the case of multinomial data, computing the modern version of stochastic complexity, defined as the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) criterion, requires computing a sum with an exponential number of terms. Furthermore, in order to apply NML in practice, one often needs to compute a whole table of these exponential sums. In our previous work, we were able to compute this table by a recursive algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to significantly improve the time complexity of this algorithm. The techniques used here are based on the discrete Fourier transformand the convolution theorem.|Petri Kontkanen,Petri MyllymÃ¤ki","80495|VLDB|2005|An Efficient and Scalable Approach to CNN Queries in a Road Network|A continuous search in a road network retrieves the objects which satisfy a query condition at any point on a path. For example, return the three nearest restaurants from all locations on my route from point s to point e. In this paper, we deal with NN queries as well as continuous NN queries in the context of moving objects databases. The performance of existing approaches based on the network distance such as the shortest path length depends largely on the density of objects of interest. To overcome this problem, we propose UNICONS (a uuniuque uconutinuous usuearch algorithm) for NN queries and CNN queries performed on a network. We incorporate the use of precomputed NN lists into Dijkstra's algorithm for NN queries. A mathematical rationale is employed to produce the final results of CNN queries. Experimental results for real-life datasets of various sizes show that UNICONS outperforms its competitors by up to . times for NN queries and  times for CNN queries depending on the density of objects and the number of NNs required.|Hyung-Ju Cho,Chin-Wan Chung","16601|IJCAI|2007|An Axiomatic Approach to Personalized Ranking Systems|Personalized ranking systems and trust systems are an essential tool for collaboration in a multi-agent environment.

Factors affecting road speed, such as weather, time of day, and vehicle type, need to be considered in order to select fast routes that match current driving conditions. Most existing systems compute fastest paths based on road Euclidean distance and a small set of predefined road speeds. However, \"History is often the best teacher\". Historical traffic data or driving patterns are often more useful than the simple Euclidean distance-based computation because people must have good reasons to choose these routes, e.g., they may want to avoid those that pass through high crime areas at night or that likely encounter accidents, road construction, or traffic jams. In this paper, we present an adaptive fastest path algorithm capable of efficiently accounting for important driving and speed patterns mined from a large set of traffic data. The algorithm is based on the following observations () The hierarchy of roads can be used to partition the road network into areas, and different path pre-computation strategies can be used at the area level, () we can limit our route search strategy to edges and path segments that are actually frequently traveled in the data, and () drivers usually traverse the road network through the largest roads available given the distance of the trip, except if there are small roads with a significant speed advantage over the large ones. Through an extensive experimental evaluation on real road networks we show that our algorithm provides desirable (short and well-supported) routes, and that it is significantly faster than competing methods.|Hector Gonzalez,Jiawei Han,Xiaolei Li,Margaret Myslinska,John Paul Sondag","80823|VLDB|2007|A genetic approach for random testing of database systems|Testing a database engine has been and continues to be a challenging task. The space of possible SQL queries along with their possible access paths is practically unbounded. Moreover, this space is continuously increasing in size as the feature set of modern DBMS systems expands with every product release. To tackle these problems, random query generator tools have been used to create large numbers of test cases. While such test case generators enable the creation of complex and syntactically correct SQL queries, they do not guarantee that the queries produced return results or exercise desired DBMS components. Very often the generated queries contain logical contradictions, which cause \"short-circuits\" at the query optimization layer, failing to exercise the lower layers of the database engine (query optimization, query execution, access methods, etc.) In this paper we present a random test case generation technique, which provides solutions to the above problems. Our technique utilizes execution feedback, obtained from the DBMS under test, in order to guide the test generation process toward specific DBMS subcomponents and rarely exercised code paths. Test cases are created incrementally using a genetic approach, which synthesizes query characteristics that are of interest for the purposes of test coverage. Our experiments indicate that our technique can outperform other methods of random testing in terms of efficiency and code coverage. We also provide experimental results which show that the use of execution feedback improves code coverage of specific DBMS components. Finally, we share our experiences gained from using this testing approach during the development cycles of Microsoft SQL Server.|Hardik Bati,Leo Giakoumakis,Steve Herbert,Aleksandras Surna","16043|IJCAI|2005|Analysis and Verification of Qualitative Models of Genetic Regulatory Networks A Model-Checking Approach|Methods developed for the qualitative simulation of dynamical systems have turned out to be powerful tools for studying genetic regulatory networks.

Classification approaches consider only one or two candidate antecedents for a pronoun at a time, whereas ranking allows all candidates to be evaluated together. We argue that this provides a more natural fit for the task than classification and show that it delivers significant performance improvements on the ACE datasets. In particular, our ranker obtains an error reduction of .% over the best classification approach, the twin-candidate model. Furthermore, we show that the ranker offers some computational advantage over the twin-candidate classifier, since it easily allows the inclusion of more candidate antecedents during training. This approach leads to a further error reduction of .% (a total reduction of .% over the twin-candidate model).|Pascal Denis,Jason Baldridge","16367|IJCAI|2007|A Fast Analytical Algorithm for Solving Markov Decision Processes with Real-Valued Resources|Agents often have to construct plans that obey deadlines or, more generally, resource limits for real-valued resources whose consumption can only be characterized by probability distributions, such as execution time or battery power. These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.|Janusz Marecki,Sven Koenig,Milind Tambe"],["80587|VLDB|2005|Temporal Management of RFID Data|RFID technology can be used to significantly improve the efficiency of business processes by providing the capability of automatic identification and data capture. This technology poses many new challenges on current data management systems. RFID data are time-dependent, dynamically changing, in large volumes, and carry implicit semantics. RFID data management systems need to effectively support such large scale temporal data created by RFID applications. These systems need to have an explicit temporal data model for RFID data to support tracking and monitoring queries.

As the number and size of such trees increases, so does the need for efficient data storage and query capabilities. Although much attention has been focused on XML as a tree data model, phylogenetic trees differ from document-oriented applications in their size and depth, and their need for structure-based queries rather than path-based queries.This paper focuses on Crimson, a tree storage system for phylogenetic trees used to evaluate phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms within the context of the NSF CIPRes project. A goal of the modeling component of the CIPRes project is to construct a huge simulation tree representing a \"gold standard\" of evolutionary history against which phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms can be tested.In this demonstration, we highlight our storage and indexing strategies and show how Crimson is used for benchmarking phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms.

However, this model is not suitable for processing concurrent distributed queries because the foundation, the memory-disk hierarchy, does not exist for data provided by remote sources. Therefore, the query engine cannot exploit any data sharing so that each process will have to interact with data sources independently issue data requests and fetch data over the network. This paper presents Request Window, a novel DQP mechanism that can detect and employ data sharing opportunities across concurrent distributed queries. By combining multiple similar data requests issued to the same data source to a common data request, Request Window allows concurrent query executing processes to share the common result data. With the benefits of reduced source burdens and data transfers, the throughput of query engine can be significantly improved. This paper also introduces the IGNITE system, an extended PostgreSQL with DQP support. Our experimental results show that Request Window makes IGNITE achieve a .x speedup over a commercial data integration system when running a workload of distributed TPC-H queries.|Rubao Lee,Minghong Zhou,Huaming Liao","80498|VLDB|2005|U-DBMS A Database System for Managing Constantly-Evolving Data|In many systems, sensors are used to acquire information from external environments such as temperature, pressure and locations. Due to continuous changes in these values, and limited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), it is often infeasible for the database to store the exact values at all times. Queries that uses these old values can produce invalid results. In order to manage the uncertainty between the actual sensor value and the database value, we propose a system called U-DBMS. U-DBMS extends the database system with uncertainty management functionalities. In particular, each data value is represented as an interval and a probability distribution function, and it can be processed with probabilistic query operators to produce imprecise (but correct) answers. This demonstration presents a PostgreSQL-based system that handles uncertainty and probabilistic queries for constantly-evolving data.|Reynold Cheng,Sarvjeet Singh,Sunil Prabhakar","80490|VLDB|2005|PSYCHO A Prototype System for Pattern Management|Patterns represent in a compact and rich in semantics way huge quantity of heterogeneous data.
