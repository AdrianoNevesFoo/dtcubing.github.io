An important open problem is to understand the role of populations in MOEAs. We present a simple bi-objective problem which emphasizes when populations are needed. Rigorous runtime analysis point out an exponential runtime gap between the population-based algorithm Simple Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimizer (SEMO) and several single individual-based algorithms on this problem. This means that among the algorithms considered, only the population-based MOEA is successful and all other algorithms fail.|Oliver Giel,Per Kristian Lehre","57621|GECCO|2006|Combining gradient techniques for numerical multi-objective evolutionary optimization|Recently, gradient techniques for solving numerical multi-objective optimization problems have appeared in the literature. Although promising results have already been obtained when combined with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), an important question remains what is the best way to integrate the use of gradient techniques in the evolutionary cycle of a MOEA. In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA. During optimization, the effectivity of the gradient techniques is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective operator to spend the most resources. In addition, we indicate how the multi-objective search can be stimulated to also search $mboxemphalong $ the Pareto front, ultimately resulting in a better and wider spread of solutions. We perform tests on a few well-known benchmark problems as well as two novel benchmark problems with specific gradient properties. We compare the results of our adaptive resource-allocation scheme with the same MOEA without the use of gradient techniques and a scheme in which resource allocation is constant. The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

To achieve convergence, most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms today employ Pareto-ranking as the main criteria for fitness calculation. The computation of Pareto-rank in a population is time consuming, and arguably the most computationally expensive component in an iteration of the said algorithms. This paper proposes a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm which avoids Pareto-ranking altogether by employing the transitivity of the domination relation. The proposed algorithm is an elitist algorithm with explicit diversity preservation procedure. It applies a measure reflecting the degree of domination between solutions in a steady-state replacement strategy to determine which individuals survive to the next iteration. Results on nine standard test functions demonstrated that the algorithm performs favorably compared to the popular NSGA-II in terms of convergence as well as diversity of the Pareto-set approximation, and is computationally more efficient.|Dipti Srinivasan,Lily Rachmawati","57702|GECCO|2006|Incorporation of decision makers preference into evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms|The main characteristic feature of evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) is that no a priori information about the decision maker's preference is utilized in the search phase. EMO algorithms try to find a set of well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions with a wide range of objective values. It is, however, very difficult for EMO algorithms to find a good solution set of a multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem with many decision variables andor many objectives. In this paper, we propose an idea of incorporating the decision maker's preference into EMO algorithms to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal solutions of such a hard multiobjective optimization problem.|Hisao Ishibuchi,Yusuke Nojima,Kaname Narukawa,Tsutomu Doi","57699|GECCO|2006|Rotated test problems for assessing the performance of multi-objective optimization algorithms|This paper presents four rotatable multi-objective test problems that are designed for testing EMO (Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization) algorithms on their ability in dealing with parameter interactions.

Evaluation of EMO algorithms with respect to this class of problem has relevance to real-world problems, which are seldom separable. However, many EMO test problems do not have this characteristic. The proposed set of test problems in this paper is intended to address this important requirement. The design principles of these test problems and a description of each new test problem are presented.

The trade-off characteristic renders such solutions of particular interest in practical applications. This paper presents a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm focused on the knee regions. The algorithm facilitates better decision making in contexts where high marginal rates of return are desirable for Decision Makers. The proposed approach computes a transformation of the original objectives based on weighted-sum functions. The transformed functions identify niches which correspond to knee regions in the objective space. The extent and density of coverage of the knee regions are controllable by the niche strength and pool size parameters. Although based on weighted-sums, the algorithm is capable of finding solutions in the non-convex regions of the Pareto-front.|Lily Rachmawati,Dipti Srinivasan","57843|GECCO|2006|Multiobjective evolutionary optimization for visual data mining with virtual reality spaces application to Alzheimer gene expressions|This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization approach to the problem of computing virtual reality spaces for the visual representation of relational structures (e.g. databases), symbolic knowledge and others, in the context of visual data mining and knowledge discovery. Procedures based on evolutionary computation are discussed. In particular, the NSGA-II algorithm is used as a framework for an instance of this methodology simultaneously minimizing Sammon's error for dissimilarity measures, and mean cross-validation error on a k-nn pattern classifier. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example from genomics (in particular, Alzheimer's disease) by constructing virtual reality spaces resulting from multi-objective optimization. Selected solutions along the Pareto front approximation are used as nonlinearly transformed features for new spaces that compromise similarity structure preservation (from an unsupervised perspective) and class separability (from a supervised pattern recognition perspective), simultaneously. The possibility of spanning a range of solutions between these two important goals, is a benefit for the knowledge discovery and data understanding process. The quality of the set of discovered solutions is superior to the ones obtained separately, from the point ofview of visual data mining.|Julio J. Valdés,Alan J.

The proposed approach adopts an external archive in order to retain the nondominated solutions found during the evolutionary process. Additionally, the approach also incorporates the concept of pa-dominance to get a good distribution of the solutions retained. The main idea of the approach is to use differential evolution (DE) as our main search engine, trying to translate its good convergence properties exhibited in single-objective optimization to the multi-objective case. Rough sets theory is adopted in a second stage of the search in order to improve the spread of the nondominated solutions that have been found so far. Our hybrid approach is validated using standard test functions and metrics commonly adopted in the specialized literature. Our results are compared with respect to the NSGA-II, which is a MOEA representative of the state-of-the-art in the area.|Alfredo García Hernández-Díaz,Luis V. Santana-Quintero,Carlos A.

However, much less of such type of work has been done for efficient XSLT processing of XML documents stored and managed by the database. This is partially due to the observation that the rule based template driven XSLT execution model does not fit nicely with the traditional declarative query language processing model which leverages index probing and iterator based pull mode that can be scaled to handle large size data. In this paper, we share our experience of efficient processing of XSLT in Oracle XML DB. We present the technique of processing XSLT efficiently in database by rewriting XSLT stylesheets into highly efficient XQuery through partially evaluating XSLT over the XML documents structural information. Consequently, we can leverage all the work done for efficient XQueryXPath processing in database to achieve combined optimisations of XSLT with XQueryXPath and SQLXML in Oracle XMLDB. This effectively makes XSLT processing scale to large size XML documents using classical declarative query processing techniques in DBMS.|Zhen Hua Liu,Anguel Novoselsky","80712|VLDB|2006|State-Slice New Paradigm of Multi-query Optimization of Window-based Stream Queries|Modern stream applications such as sensor monitoring systems and publishsubscription services necessitate the handling of large numbers of continuous queries specified over high volume data streams. Efficient sharing of computations among multiple continuous queries, especially for the memory- and CPU-intensive window-based operations, is critical. A novel challenge in this scenario is to allow resource sharing among similar queries, even if they employ windows of different lengths. This paper first reviews the existing sharing methods in the literature, and then illustrates the significant performance shortcomings of these methods.This paper then presents a novel paradigm for the sharing of window join queries. Namely we slice window states of a join operator into fine-grained window slices and form a chain of sliced window joins. By using an elaborate pipelining methodology, the number of joins after state slicing is reduced from quadratic to linear. This novel sharing paradigm enables us to push selections down into the chain and flexibly select subsequences of such sliced window joins for computation sharing among queries with different window sizes. Based on the state-slice sharing paradigm, two algorithms are proposed for the chain buildup. One minimizes the memory consumption while the other minimizes the CPU usage. The algorithms are proven to find the optimal chain with respect to memory or CPU usage for a given query workload. We have implemented the slice-share paradigm within the data stream management system CAPE. The experimental results show that our strategy provides the best performance over a diverse range of workload settings among all alternate solutions in the literature.|Song Wang,Elke A.

When overloaded, the system must shed load in order to maintain low-latency query results. In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

Interestingly, until now no approach was proposed that is able to represent all of the above data in a single, powerful yet simple data model. This paper fills this gap. We present the iMeMex Data Model (iDM) for personal information management. iDM is able to represent unstructured, semi-structured and structured data inside a single model. Moreover, iDM is powerful enough to represent graph-structured data, intensional data as well as infinite data streams. Further, our model enables to represent the structural information available inside files. As a consequence, the artifical boundary between inside and outside a file is removed to enable a new class of queries. As iDM allows the representation of the whole personal dataspace  of a user in a single model, it is the foundation of the iMeMex Personal Dataspace Management System (PDSMS) , , . This paper also presents results of an evaluation of an initial iDM implementation in iMeMex that show that iDM can be efficiently supported in a real PDSMS.|Jens-Peter Dittrich,Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles","80696|VLDB|2006|Efficient Scheduling of Heterogeneous Continuous Queries|Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) typically host multiple Continuous Queries (CQ) that process streams of data.

We show that unlike standard on-line systems, scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will be different than policies that optimize for average slowdown which is more appropriate metric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. We also propose a hybrid scheduling policy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness. We further discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploit sharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs.

Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature.

In many applications, e.g., XML security enforcement, it is prohibitively expensive to materialize and maintain a large number of views. Therefore, views are necessarily virtual. An immediate question then is how to answer queries on XML virtual views. A common approach is to rewrite a query on the view to an equivalent one on the underlying document, and evaluate the rewritten query. This is the approach used in the Secure MOdular Query Engine (SMOQE). The demo presents SMOQE, the first system to provide efficient support for answering queries over virtual and possibly recursively defined XML views.

We have developed an on-line XML exploration system, termed AQAX that relies on accurate XML summaries in order to enable the rapid exploration of large data sets.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs.

First, it describes the use of genetic programming to automatically synthesize a solution to the challenge problem posed at an international competition held every four years in the field of optical design. In , the competition at the International Optical Design Conference attracted  entries from  well-known optical designers, commercial consultants, and patent holders from many of the field's most prominent companies, universities, and research institutions. The  human contestants spent an average of . hours working on their entries. Virtually all entries were considered good solutions to the challenge problem. Genetic programming automatically synthesized a design \"from scratch\" - that is, without starting from a pre-existing human-created design and without pre-specifying the number of lenses, the physical layout of the lenses, or the numerical or non-numerical parameters of the lenses. The run of genetic programming did not employ any knowledge base of design techniques or principles from the field of optical design and did not entail any human intervention during the run. The genetically evolved optical lens system would have ranked in the middle (st) if it had been entered into the  competition and is therefore an instance of a \"human-competitive\" result produced by genetic programming. Second, this paper presents a mutation operation for numerical constants that is especially appropriate for problems in which the to-be-designed structure contains a large number of non-linearly interrelated numerical values and for problems in which the topology of the solution is to be automatically created.|Lee W.

The genetic programming systems use common mutation and crossover operators as well as fitness-proportional selection. In addition, the mutation and crossover rates are annealed to zero in predefined fashion over the course of the algorithm, and power-law scaling is used for the (possibly population-dependent) initial fitness function with (unbounded) logarithmic growth in the exponent.We assume that a set of globally optimal creatures for the optimization problem instance exists. In addition, it is assumed that the ratio of the best fitness of globally optimal creatures vs the fitness of other creatures is greater or equal a constant  in any population they jointly reside in. We discuss how both conditions can usually be satisfied in application settings. Under the above conditions, a selected, traceable sequence of probability distributions over the possible states of the properly scaled genetic programming system converge in time towards the convex set of probability distributions over uniform populations that contain only globally optimal creatures.|Lothar M.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time. The proposed fast matching scheme also fits in any other LCS other than XCS.|Xavier Llorà,Kumara Sastry","57793|GECCO|2006|A survey of mutation techniques in genetic programming|The importance of mutation varies across evolutionary computation domains including genetic programming, evolution strategies, and genetic algorithms.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa","57601|GECCO|2006|A Bayesian approach to learning classifier systems in uncertain environments|In this paper we propose a Bayesian framework for XCS , called BXCS.

Depending on the complexity of the optimization problem, a meta-heuristic method that may have proven to be successful in the past might not work as well. Hence it is becoming a common practice to hybridize meta-heuristics and local heuristics with the aim of improving the overall performance.

The (+) EA applies global mutations than can reach any point in the search space in one step together with an elitist selection mechanism. Simulated annealing restricts its search to a neighborhood but employs a randomized selection scheme where the probability for accepting a move to a new point in the search space depends on the difference in function values as well as on the current time step. Otherwise, the two algorithms are equal. It is known that the different philosophies of search implemented in the two heuristics can lead to exponential performance gaps between the two algorithms with respect to the expected optimization time. Even for very restricted classes of objective functions where the differences in function values between neighboring points are strictly limited the performance differences can be huge. Here, a more local point of view is taken. Considering obstacles in the fitness landscapes it is proven that the local performance of the two algorithms is remarkably similar in spite of their different search behaviors.|Thomas Jansen,Ingo Wegener","57629|GECCO|2006|GRASP - evolution for constraint satisfaction problems|There are several evolutionary approaches for solving random binary Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs).

Typically, timing constraints must be satisfied so that real-time embedded systems work properly and safely. Execution time testing involves finding the best and worst case execution times to determine if timing constraints are respected. Evolutionary real-time testing (ERTT) is used to dynamically search for the extreme execution times. It can be shown that ERTT outperforms the traditional methods based on static analysis. However, during the evolutionary search, some parts of the source code are never accessed. Moreover, it turns out that ERTT delivers different extreme execution times in a high number of generations for the same test object, the results are neither reliable nor efficient. We propose a new approach to ERTT which makes use of seeding the evolutionary algorithm with test data achieving a high structural coverage. Using such test data ensures a comprehensive exploration of the search space and leads to rise the confidence in the results. We present also another improvement method based on restricting the range of the input variables in the initial population in order to reduce the search space. Experiments with these approaches demonstrate an increase of reliability in terms of constant extreme execution times and a gain in efficiency in terms of number of generations needed.|Marouane Tlili,Stefan Wappler,Harmen Sthamer","57853|GECCO|2006|Use of statistical outlier detection method in adaptive evolutionary algorithms|In this paper, the issue of adapting probabilities for Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) search operators is revisited.

Not only approaches that search for numeric test data for procedural test objects have been investigated, but also techniques for automatically generating test programs that represent object-oriented unit test cases. Compared to numeric test data, test programs optimized for object-oriented unit testing are more complex. Method call sequences that realize interesting test scenarios must be evolved. An arbitrary method call sequence is not necessarily feasible due to call dependences which exist among the methods that potentially appear in a method call sequence. The approach presented in this paper relies on a tree-based representation of method call sequences by which sequence feasibility is preserved throughout the entire search process. In contrast to other approaches in this area, neither repair of individuals nor penalty mechanisms are required. Strongly-typed genetic programming is employed to generate method call trees. In order to deal with runtime exceptions, we use an extended distance-based fitness function. We performed experiments with four test objects.

It has been shown that in a simple \"two peaks\" problem, where the fitness landscape consists of a broad, low peak, and a narrow, high peak, individuals initially converge on the lower (less fit), but broader peak, and that increasing an individual's genetic robustness through growth is a necessary prerequisite for convergence on the higher, narrower peak . If growth is restricted, the population remains converged on the less fit solution. We tested whether this result holds true only for generational algorithms, or whether it applies to steady state algorithms as well. We conclude that although growth occurs with both algorithms, the steady state algorithm is able to converge on the higher peak without this growth. This result shows that the role of genetic robustness in the evolutionary process is significantly different in generational versus steady state algorithms.|Josh Jones,Terry Soule","57799|GECCO|2006|Selecting for evolvable representations|Evolutionary algorithms tend to produce solutions that are not evolvable Although current fitness may be high, further search is impeded as the effects of mutation and crossover become increasingly detrimental. In nature, in addition to having high fitness, organisms have evolvable genomes phenotypic variation resulting from random mutation is structured and robust. Evolvability is important because it allows the population to produce meaningful variation, leading to efficient search. However, because evolvability does not improve immediate fitness, it must be selected for indirectly. One way to establish such a selection pressure is to change the fitness function systematically. Under such conditions, evolvability emerges only if the representation allows manipulating how genotypic variation maps onto phenotypic variation and if such manipulations lead to detectable changes in fitness. This research forms a framework for understanding how fitness function and representation interact to produce evolvability. Ultimately evolvable encodings may lead to evolutionary algorithms that exhibit the structured complexity and robustness found in nature.|Joseph Reisinger,Risto Miikkulainen","57801|GECCO|2006|Multiobjective genetic algorithms for multiscaling excited state direct dynamics in photochemistry|This paper studies the effectiveness of multiobjective genetic and evolutionary algorithms in multiscaling excited state direct dynamics in photochemistry via rapid reparameterization of semiempirical methods. Using a very limited set of ab initio and experimental data, semiempirical parameters are reoptimized to provide globally accurate potential energy surfaces, thereby eliminating the need for full-fledged ab initio dynamics simulations, which are very expensive. Through reoptimization of the semiempirical methods, excited-state energetics are predicted accurately, while retaining accurate ground-state predictions. The results show that the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm consistently yields solutions that are significantly better---up to % lower error in the energy and .% lower error in the energy-gradient---than those reported in the literature. Multiple high-quality parameter sets are obtained that are verified with quantum dynamical calculations, which show near-ideal behavior on critical and untested excited state geometries. The results demonstrate that the reparameterization strategy via evolutionary algorithms is a promising way to extend direct dynamics simulations of photochemistry to multi-picosecond time scales.|Kumara Sastry,D.

The combined score function is usually linear. To efficiently answer top-k queries, preprocessing and indexing the data have been used to speed up the run time performance. Many indexing methods allow the online query algorithms progressively retrieve the data and stop at a certain point. However, in many cases, the number of data accesses is sensitive to the query parameters (i.e., linear weights in the score functions).In this paper, we study the sequentially layered indexing problem where tuples are put into multiple consecutive layers and any top-k query can be answered by at most k layers of tuples. We propose a new criterion for building the layered index. A layered index is robust if for any k, the number of tuples in the top k layers is minimal in comparison with all the other alternatives. The robust index guarantees the worst case performance for arbitrary query parameters. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for robust index. The problem is shown solvable within O(ndlog n) (where d is the number of dimensions, and n is the number of tuples). To reduce the high complexity of the exact solution, we develop an approximate approach, which has time complexity O(d n(log n)r(d)-), where r(d)  d + d d.

In many cases, a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results.

Top-k queries operate on index lists for a query's elementary conditions and aggregate scores for result candidates. One of the best implementation methods in this setting is the family of threshold algorithms, which aim to terminate the index scans as early as possible based on lower and upper bounds for the final scores of result candidates. This procedure performs sequential disk accesses for sorted index scans, but also has the option of performing random accesses to resolve score uncertainty. This entails scheduling for the two kinds of accesses ) the prioritization of different index lists in the sequential accesses, and ) the decision on when to perform random accesses and for which candidates.The prior literature has studied some of these scheduling issues, but only for each of the two access types in isolation. The current paper takes an integrated view of the scheduling issues and develops novel strategies that outperform prior proposals by a large margin. Our main contributions are new, principled, scheduling methods based on a Knapsack-related optimization for sequential accesses and a cost model for random accesses. The methods can be further boosted by harnessing probabilistic estimators for scores, selectivities, and index list correlations. In performance experiments with three different datasets (TREC Terabyte, HTTP server logs, and IMDB), our methods achieved significant performance gains compared to the best previously known methods.|Holger Bast,Debapriyo Majumdar,Ralf Schenkel,Martin Theobald,Gerhard Weikum","57693|GECCO|2006|DECA dimension extracting coevolutionary algorithm|Coevolution has often been based on averaged outcomes, resulting in unstable evaluation.

Interestingly, until now no approach was proposed that is able to represent all of the above data in a single, powerful yet simple data model. This paper fills this gap. We present the iMeMex Data Model (iDM) for personal information management. iDM is able to represent unstructured, semi-structured and structured data inside a single model. Moreover, iDM is powerful enough to represent graph-structured data, intensional data as well as infinite data streams. Further, our model enables to represent the structural information available inside files. As a consequence, the artifical boundary between inside and outside a file is removed to enable a new class of queries. As iDM allows the representation of the whole personal dataspace  of a user in a single model, it is the foundation of the iMeMex Personal Dataspace Management System (PDSMS) , , . This paper also presents results of an evaluation of an initial iDM implementation in iMeMex that show that iDM can be efficiently supported in a real PDSMS.|Jens-Peter Dittrich,Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles","80663|VLDB|2006|POPFED Progressive Query Optimization for Federated Queries in DB|Federated queries are regular relational queries accessing data on one or more remote relational or non-relational data sources, possibly combining them with tables stored in the federated DBMS server. Their execution is typically divided between the federated server and the remote data sources. Outdated and incomplete statistics have a bigger impact on federated DBMS than on regular DBMS, as maintenance of federated statistics is unequally more complicated and expensive than the maintenance of the local statistics consequently bad performance commonly occurs for federated queries due to the selection of a suboptimal query plan. To solve this problem we propose a progressive optimization technique for federated queries called POPFED by extending the state of the art for progressive reoptimization for local source queries, POP . POPFED uses (a) an opportunistic, but risk controlled reoptimization technique for federated DBMS, (b) a technique for multiple reoptimizations during federated query processing with a strategy to discover redundant and eliminate partial results, and (c) a mechanism to eagerly procure statistics in a federated environment. In this demonstration we showcase POPFED implemented in a prototype version of WebSphere Information Integrator for DB using the TPC-H benchmark database and its workload. For selected queries of the workload we show unique features including multi-round reoptimizations using both a new graphical reoptimization progress monitor POPMonitor and the DB graphical plan explain tool.|Holger Kache,Wook-Shin Han,Volker Markl,Vijayshankar Raman,Stephan Ewen","80708|VLDB|2006|Similarity Search A Matching Based Approach|Similarity search is a crucial task in multimedia retrieval and data mining. Most existing work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem, which considers the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set of features. Such an approach has two drawbacks ) it leaves many partial similarities uncovered ) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the k-n-match problem in this paper.The k-n-match problem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the data objects in n dimensions, where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and these n dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objects returned in the answer set match best. The k-n-match query is expected to be superior to the kNN query in discovering partial similarities, however, it may not be as good in identifying full similarity since a single value of n may only correspond to a particular aspect of an object instead of the entirety. To address this problem, we further introduce the frequent k-n-match problem, which finds a set of objects that appears in the k-n-match answers most frequently for a range of n values. Moreover, we propose search algorithms for both problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of individual attributes retrieved, which is especially useful for information retrieval from multiple systems. We can also apply the proposed algorithmic strategy to achieve a disk based algorithm for the (frequent) k-n-match query. By a thorough experimental study using both real and synthetic data sets, we show that ) the k-n-match query yields better result than the kNN query in identifying similar objects by partial similarities ) our proposed method (for processing the frequent k-n-match query) outperforms existing techniques for similarity search in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.|Anthony K.

Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature.

The proposed version was evaluated against the original Ant-Miner algorithm in six public-domain datasets and was found to produce comparable results in terms of predictive accuracy. However, the proposed version has the advantage of discovering more modular rules, i.e., rules that can be interpreted independently from other rules - unlike the rules in an ordered list, where the interpretation of a rule requires knowledge of the previous rules in the list.

Because of this expense, such applications have largely been unable to directly use such models in queries, with either on-demand or continuous query processing technology. Query processors are hindered in their ability to optimize expensive modeling functions due to the \"black box\" nature of existing user-defined function (UDF) interfaces. In this paper, we address the problem of querying over sophisticated models with the development of VAOs (Variable-Accuracy Operators). VAOs use a new function interface that exposes the trade-off between compute time and accuracy that exists in many modeling functions. Using this interface, VAOs adaptively run each function call in a query only to an accuracy needed to answer the query, thus eliminating unneeded work. In this paper, we present the design of VAOs for a set of common query operations.

Holistic twig query processing techniques ,  have been developed to minimize the intermediate results, namely, those root-to-leaf path matches that are not in the final twig results. However, useless path matches cannot be completely avoided, especially when there is a parent-child relationship in the twig query. Furthermore, existing approaches do not consider the fact that in practice, in order to process XPath or XQuery statements, a more powerful form of twig queries, namely, Generalized-Tree-Pattern (GTP)  queries, is required. Most existing works on processing GTP queries generally calls for costly post-processing for eliminating redundant data andor grouping of the matching results.In this paper, we first propose a novel hierarchical stack encoding scheme to compactly represent the twig results. We introduce TwigStack, a bottom-up algorithm for processing twig queries based on this encoding scheme. Then we show how to efficiently enumerate the query results from the encodings for a given GTP query. To our knowledge, this is the first GTP matching solution that avoids any post path-join, sort, duplicate elimination and grouping operations. Extensive performance studies on various data sets and queries show that the proposed TwigStack algorithm not only has better twig query processing performance than state-of-the-art algorithms, but is also capable of efficiently processing the more complex GTP queries.|Songting Chen,Hua-Gang Li,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Wang-Pin Hsiung,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

Of particular interest is Cooperative Rec-I-DCM's selection criteria for maintaining a population of solutions. Our experiments reveal that diverse populations outperform Rec-I-DCM in terms of average rates of convergence to best-known MP scores. To achieve greater performance, we designed an elitist population strategy, in which each solution's tree score matches that of the best score found in each generation. The elitist strategy was by far the worst overall performer in our experiments. Hence, being greedy is not always the best approach.

In the genetic programming community, researchers' view of mutation's effectiveness spans the range from an ineffective or marginal operator, to a neutral operator, to a highly effective operator that evolves solutions more effectively than genetic programming with crossover alone. Mutation implementation and associated parameters are often under reported in genetic programming research and typically lack context that justifies the technique and parameter selection. In part, reporting variance stems from the adaptation of mutation developed by the genetic algorithm community, and the creation of new mutation techniques in genetic programming. This survey describes the controversial operator in genetic programming applications, mutation selection operators, mutation techniques and offers an organization of mutation characteristics. We suggest methodologies to improve reporting of mutation parameters and related individual selection methods.|Alan Piszcz,Terence Soule","57808|GECCO|2006|Predicting currency exchange rates by genetic programming with trigonometric functions and high-order statistics|This paper describes an extension of the traditional application of Genetic Programming in the domain of the prediction of daily currency exchange rates.

A minimal RSA (a MRSA) is one for which the total path length of the edges in the tree is minimal. RSAs have application in VLSI design. Curiously, although a RSA is a tree, to our knowledge, previous genetic attacks on the MRSA problem have not used tree-based approaches to representation, nor to the operations of crossover and mutation. We show why some care is needed in the choice of such genetic operators. Then we present tree-based operators for crossover and mutation, which are successful in creating true RSAs from source RSAs without the need of repair steps. We compare our results to two earlier researches, and find that our approach gives good results, but not results that are consistently better than those earlier approaches.|William A.

The goal of such a model is to classify examples (records or data instances) into classes or categories of the same type. The use of variables (attributes) not related to the classes can reduce the accuracy and reliability of a classification or prediction model. Superuous variables can also increase the costs of building a model - particularly on large data sets.

In this paper we show that PSO appears to work well on \"single-funnel\" optimization functions. On more complex optimization problems, PSO tends to converge too quickly and then fail to make further progress. We contend that most benchmarks for PSO have classically been demonstrated on single-funnel functions. However, in practice, optimization tasks are more complex and possess higher problem dimensionality. We present empirical results that support our conjecture that PSO performs well on single-funnel functions but tends to stagnate on more complicated landscapes.|Andrew M.

Furthermore, G-PSO adopts a \"reactive\" determination of the step size, based on feedback from the last iterations. This is in contrast to the basic particle swarm algorithm, in which the particles explore the search space by using both the individual \"cognitive\" component and the \"social\" knowledge and no feedback is used for the self-tuning of algorithm parameters.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa","57708|GECCO|2006|Introducing recombination with dynamic linkage discovery to particle swarm optimization|In this paper, we introduce the recombination operator with the technique of dynamic linkage discovery to particle swarm optimization (PSO) in order to improve the performance of PSO.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

Holistic twig query processing techniques ,  have been developed to minimize the intermediate results, namely, those root-to-leaf path matches that are not in the final twig results. However, useless path matches cannot be completely avoided, especially when there is a parent-child relationship in the twig query. Furthermore, existing approaches do not consider the fact that in practice, in order to process XPath or XQuery statements, a more powerful form of twig queries, namely, Generalized-Tree-Pattern (GTP)  queries, is required. Most existing works on processing GTP queries generally calls for costly post-processing for eliminating redundant data andor grouping of the matching results.In this paper, we first propose a novel hierarchical stack encoding scheme to compactly represent the twig results. We introduce TwigStack, a bottom-up algorithm for processing twig queries based on this encoding scheme. Then we show how to efficiently enumerate the query results from the encodings for a given GTP query. To our knowledge, this is the first GTP matching solution that avoids any post path-join, sort, duplicate elimination and grouping operations. Extensive performance studies on various data sets and queries show that the proposed TwigStack algorithm not only has better twig query processing performance than state-of-the-art algorithms, but is also capable of efficiently processing the more complex GTP queries.|Songting Chen,Hua-Gang Li,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Wang-Pin Hsiung,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

We identify two such classes single occurrence regular expressions (SOREs) and chain regular expressions (CHAREs). Both classes capture the far majority of the regular expressions occurring in practical DTDs and are succinct by definition. We present the algorithm iDTD (infer DTD) that learns SOREs from strings by first inferring an automaton by known techniques and then translating that automaton to a corresponding SORE, possibly by repairing the automaton when no equivalent SORE can be found. In the process, we introduce a novel automaton to regular expression rewrite technique which is of independent interest. We show that iDTD outperforms existing systems in accuracy, conciseness and speed. In a scenario where only a very small amount of XML data is available, for instance when generated by Web service requests or by answers to queries, iDTD produces regular expressions which are too specific. Therefore, we introduce a novel learning algorithm CRX that directly infers CHAREs (which form a subclass of SOREs) without going through an automaton representation. We show that CRX performs very well within its target class on very small data sets.

Redundantly stored information can lead not just to a higher data storage cost, but also to increased costs for data transfer and data manipulation. Furthermore, such data redundancies can lead to potential update anomalies, rendering the database inconsistent.One way to avoid data redundancies is to employ good schema design based on known functional dependencies. In fact, several recent studies have focused on defining the notion of XML Functional Dependencies (XML FDs) to capture XML data redundancies. We observe further that XML databases are often \"casually designed\" and XML FDs may not be determined in advance. Under such circumstances, discovering XML data redundancies (in terms of FDs) from the data itself becomes necessary and is an integral part of the schema refinement process.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first system, DiscoverXFD, for effcient discovery of XML data redundancies. It employs a novel XML data structure and introduces a new class of partition based algorithms. DiscoverXFD can not only be used for the previous definitions of XML functional dependencies, but also for a more comprehensive notion we develop in this paper, capable of detecting redundancies involving set elements while maintaining clear semantics.

Based on this semantics, XML fragments that look meaningful to a keyword-based query are effectively retrieved by the operations defined in the model. In contrast to earlier work, our model supports filters for restricting the size of a query result, which otherwise may contain a large number of potentially irrelevant fragments. We introduce a class of filters having a special property that enables significant reduction in query processing cost. Many practically useful filters fall in this class and hence, the proposed model can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents.

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems.

In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA. During optimization, the effectivity of the gradient techniques is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective operator to spend the most resources. In addition, we indicate how the multi-objective search can be stimulated to also search $mboxemphalong $ the Pareto front, ultimately resulting in a better and wider spread of solutions. We perform tests on a few well-known benchmark problems as well as two novel benchmark problems with specific gradient properties. We compare the results of our adaptive resource-allocation scheme with the same MOEA without the use of gradient techniques and a scheme in which resource allocation is constant. The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs.

When the GA is initialized with a population close to the fitness peak, the GA will be able to stay close to the fitness peak. Roughly speaking, the parameter settings involve strong recombination, weak selection, and require mutation. This \"bistability\" phenomenon has been previously investigated with needle-in-the-haystack fitness functions, but this fitness, when used with a GA with random initialization, requires a population size exponential in the string length for the GA to have nontrivial behavior. We introduce sloping-plateau fitness functions which show the bistability phenomenon and should scale to arbitrary string lengths. We introduce and use an unitation infinite population model to investigate the bistability phenomenon.

This merge process uses an heuristic that selects the minimum subset of candidate rules that obtains maximum training accuracy. Moreover the operator also includes a rule pruning scheme to avoid the inclusion of over-specific rules, and to guarantee as much as possible the robust behaviour of the LCS. This operator takes advantage from the fact that each individual in a Pittsburgh LCS is a complete solution, and the system has a global view of the solution space that the proposed rule selection algorithm exploits. We have empirically evaluated this operator using a recent LCS called GAssist. First with the standard LCS benchmark, the  bits multiplexer, and later using  standard real datasets.

The first one maintains the query results by processing only updates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the shared execution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections.

The combined score function is usually linear. To efficiently answer top-k queries, preprocessing and indexing the data have been used to speed up the run time performance. Many indexing methods allow the online query algorithms progressively retrieve the data and stop at a certain point. However, in many cases, the number of data accesses is sensitive to the query parameters (i.e., linear weights in the score functions).In this paper, we study the sequentially layered indexing problem where tuples are put into multiple consecutive layers and any top-k query can be answered by at most k layers of tuples. We propose a new criterion for building the layered index. A layered index is robust if for any k, the number of tuples in the top k layers is minimal in comparison with all the other alternatives. The robust index guarantees the worst case performance for arbitrary query parameters. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for robust index. The problem is shown solvable within O(ndlog n) (where d is the number of dimensions, and n is the number of tuples). To reduce the high complexity of the exact solution, we develop an approximate approach, which has time complexity O(d n(log n)r(d)-), where r(d)  d + d d.

Given a query and a view, the QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways (i) find an equivalent rewriting of the query using only the view, or (ii) find a maximal contained rewriting using only the view. The former is appropriate for classical query optimization and was recently studied by Xu and Ozsoyoglu for tree pattern queries (TP). However, for information integration, we cannot rely on equivalent rewriting and must instead use maximal contained rewriting as shown by Halevy. Motivated by this, we study maximal contained rewriting for TP, a core subset of XPath, both in the absence and presence of a schema. In the absence of a schema, we show there are queries whose maximal contained rewriting (MCR) can only be expressed as the union of exponentially many TPs. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting and give a polynomial time algorithm for testing the existence of an MCR. We also give an algorithm for generating the MCR when one exists. We then consider QAV in the presence of a schema. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting when the schema contains no recursion or union types, and show that it consists of at most one TP. We give an efficient polynomial time algorithm for generating the maximal contained rewriting whenever it exists. Finally, we discuss QAV in the presence of recursive schemas.|Laks V. S.

One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries.

Distance signature discretizes the distances between objects and network nodes into categories and then encodes these categories. To minimize the storage and search costs, we present the optimal category partition, and the encoding and compression algorithms for the signatures, based on a simplified network topology.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database.

We propose a general-purpose Web Service Management System (WSMS) that enables querying multiple web services in a transparent and integrated fashion. This paper tackles a first basic WSMS problem query optimization for Select-Project-Join queries spanning multiple web services. Our main result is an algorithm for arranging a query's web service calls into a pipelined execution plan that optimally exploits parallelism among web services to minimize the query's total running time. Surprisingly, the optimal plan can be found in polynomial time even in the presence of arbitrary precedence constraints among web services, in contrast to traditional query optimization where the analogous problem is NP-hard. We also give an algorithm for determining the optimal granularity of data \"chunks\" to be used for each web service call. Experiments with an initial prototype indicate that our algorithms can lead to significant performance improvement over more straightforward techniques.|Utkarsh Srivastava,Kamesh Munagala,Jennifer Widom,Rajeev Motwani","80690|VLDB|2006|An Algebraic Query Model for Effective and Efficient Retrieval of XML Fragments|Finding a suitable fragment of interest in a nonschematic XML document with a simple keyword search is a complex task. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a theoretical framework with a focus on an algebraic query model having a novel query semantics. Based on this semantics, XML fragments that look meaningful to a keyword-based query are effectively retrieved by the operations defined in the model. In contrast to earlier work, our model supports filters for restricting the size of a query result, which otherwise may contain a large number of potentially irrelevant fragments. We introduce a class of filters having a special property that enables significant reduction in query processing cost. Many practically useful filters fall in this class and hence, the proposed model can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents. Several other issues regarding algebraic manipulation of the operations defined in our query model are also formally discussed.|Sujeet Pradhan","80701|VLDB|2006|AQAX A System for Approximate XML Query Answers|On-line, interactive exploration of large databases becomes prohibitively expensive as the size of the database grows.

We apply this paradigm in the context of XML databases, where the increased complexity of data and queries amplifies the challenges behind interactive exploration. We have developed an on-line XML exploration system, termed AQAX that relies on accurate XML summaries in order to enable the rapid exploration of large data sets. To effectively support the exploration of semi-structured query answers, our system employs a tight coupling between the main query processor and the graphical clients that visualize the results.

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems. Initial results indicate that the approach improves algorithm performance, especially in problems where the frequency of objective change is high.|Iason Hatzakis,David Wallace","57670|GECCO|2006|On the effect of populations in evolutionary multi-objective optimization|Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become increasingly popular as multi-objective problem solving techniques.

The ability of the algorithms in finding, locating, and maintaining multiple optima is judged using two performance measures (i) number of peaks maintained, and (ii) computational time.

Although promising results have already been obtained when combined with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), an important question remains what is the best way to integrate the use of gradient techniques in the evolutionary cycle of a MOEA. In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA. During optimization, the effectivity of the gradient techniques is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective operator to spend the most resources. In addition, we indicate how the multi-objective search can be stimulated to also search $mboxemphalong $ the Pareto front, ultimately resulting in a better and wider spread of solutions. We perform tests on a few well-known benchmark problems as well as two novel benchmark problems with specific gradient properties. We compare the results of our adaptive resource-allocation scheme with the same MOEA without the use of gradient techniques and a scheme in which resource allocation is constant. The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

It has been shown that in a simple \"two peaks\" problem, where the fitness landscape consists of a broad, low peak, and a narrow, high peak, individuals initially converge on the lower (less fit), but broader peak, and that increasing an individual's genetic robustness through growth is a necessary prerequisite for convergence on the higher, narrower peak . If growth is restricted, the population remains converged on the less fit solution. We tested whether this result holds true only for generational algorithms, or whether it applies to steady state algorithms as well. We conclude that although growth occurs with both algorithms, the steady state algorithm is able to converge on the higher peak without this growth. This result shows that the role of genetic robustness in the evolutionary process is significantly different in generational versus steady state algorithms.|Josh Jones,Terry Soule","57792|GECCO|2006|Dynamics of evolutionary robustness|Recently there has been considerable interest in determining whether, and how much, evolutionary pressure for genetic robustness influences evolutionary processes.

Execution time testing involves finding the best and worst case execution times to determine if timing constraints are respected. Evolutionary real-time testing (ERTT) is used to dynamically search for the extreme execution times. It can be shown that ERTT outperforms the traditional methods based on static analysis. However, during the evolutionary search, some parts of the source code are never accessed. Moreover, it turns out that ERTT delivers different extreme execution times in a high number of generations for the same test object, the results are neither reliable nor efficient. We propose a new approach to ERTT which makes use of seeding the evolutionary algorithm with test data achieving a high structural coverage. Using such test data ensures a comprehensive exploration of the search space and leads to rise the confidence in the results.

Evolutionary computation is one of the most promising approaches to reinforcement learning but its success is largely restricted to off-line scenarios. In on-line scenarios, an agent must strive to maximize the reward it accrues while it is learning. Temporal difference (TD) methods, another approach to reinforcement learning, naturally excel in on-line scenarios because they have selection mechanisms for balancing the need to search for better policies exploration) with the need to accrue maximal reward (exploitation). This paper presents a novel way to strike this balance in evolutionary methods by borrowing the selection mechanisms used by TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolution to choose policies for evaluation.

Most existing work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem, which considers the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set of features. Such an approach has two drawbacks ) it leaves many partial similarities uncovered ) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the k-n-match problem in this paper.The k-n-match problem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the data objects in n dimensions, where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and these n dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objects returned in the answer set match best. The k-n-match query is expected to be superior to the kNN query in discovering partial similarities, however, it may not be as good in identifying full similarity since a single value of n may only correspond to a particular aspect of an object instead of the entirety. To address this problem, we further introduce the frequent k-n-match problem, which finds a set of objects that appears in the k-n-match answers most frequently for a range of n values. Moreover, we propose search algorithms for both problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of individual attributes retrieved, which is especially useful for information retrieval from multiple systems. We can also apply the proposed algorithmic strategy to achieve a disk based algorithm for the (frequent) k-n-match query. By a thorough experimental study using both real and synthetic data sets, we show that ) the k-n-match query yields better result than the kNN query in identifying similar objects by partial similarities ) our proposed method (for processing the frequent k-n-match query) outperforms existing techniques for similarity search in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.|Anthony K.

However, they are not able to handle large graphs, andor they do not allow interaction. We are interested on large graphs, with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Such graphs bring two challenges the first one is that any straightforward interactive manipulation will be prohibitively slow. The second one is sensory overload even if we could plot and replot the graph quickly, the user would be overwhelmed with the vast volume of information because the screen would be too cluttered as nodes and edges overlap each other.Our GMine system addresses both these issues, by using summarization and multi-resolution. GMine offers multi-resolution graph exploration by partitioning a given graph into a hierarchy of communities-within-communities and storing it into a novel R-treelike structure which we name G-Tree.

Depending on the complexity of the optimization problem, a meta-heuristic method that may have proven to be successful in the past might not work as well. Hence it is becoming a common practice to hybridize meta-heuristics and local heuristics with the aim of improving the overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive GA-ACO-LS hybrid algorithm for solving quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Empirical study on a diverse set of QAP benchmark problems shows that the proposed adaptive GA-ACO-LS converges to good solutions efficiently. The results obtained were compared to the recent state-of-the-art algorithm for QAP, and our algorithm showed obvious improvement.|Yiliang Xu,Meng-Hiot Lim,Yew-Soon Ong,Jing Tang","57647|GECCO|2006|Comparison of genetic representation schemes for scheduling soft real-time parallel applications|This paper presents a hybrid technique that combines List Scheduling (LS) with Genetic Algorithms (GA) for constructing non-preemptive schedules for soft real-time parallel applications represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

We develop a new genetic algorithm hybridized with an innovative local search procedure (bottleneck shifting) for the fJSP problem. The genetic algorithm uses two representation methods to represent solutions of the fJSP problem. Advanced crossover and mutation operators are proposed to adapt to the special chromosome structures and the characteristics of the problem. The bottleneck shifting works over two kinds of effective neighborhood, which use interchange of operation sequences and assignment of new machines for operations on the critical path. In order to strengthen the search ability, the neighborhood structure can be adjusted dynamically in the local search procedure. The performance of the proposed method is validated by numerical experiments on several representative problems.|Jie Gao,Mitsuo Gen,Linyan Sun","57764|GECCO|2006|A hybrid genetic search for multiple sequence alignment|This paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm for multiple sequence alignment.

Given a randomly selected subtree from one parent, context-aware crossover will always find the best location to place the subtree in the other parent.We examine the performance of GP when context-aware crossover is used as an extra crossover operator, and show that standard crossover is far more destructive, and that performance is better when only context-aware crossover is used.There is still a place for standard crossover, however, and results suggest that using standard crossover in the initial part of the run and then switching to context-aware crossover yields the best performance.We show that, across a range of standard GP benchmark problems, context-aware crossover produces a higher best fitness as well as a higher mean fitness, and even manages to solve the -bit multiplexer problem without ADFs. Furthermore, the individuals produced this way are much smaller than standard GP, and far fewer individual evaluations are required, so GP achieves a higher fitness by evaluating fewer and smaller individuals.|Hammad Majeed,Conor Ryan","57818|GECCO|2006|A simple line search operator for ridged landscapes|This paper describes a new simple operator for Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to climb ridged landscapes.|Andrea Soltoggio","80664|VLDB|2006|A Linear Time Algorithm for Optimal Tree Sibling Partitioning and Approximation Algorithms in Natix|Document insertion into a native XML Data Store (XDS) requires to partition the document tree into a number of storage units with limited capacity, such as records on disk pages. As intra partition navigation is much faster than navigation between partitions, minimizing the number of partitions has a beneficial effect on query performance.We present a linear time algorithm to optimally partition an ordered, labeled, weighted tree such that each partition does not exceed a fixed weight limit. Whereas traditionally tree partitioning algorithms only allow child nodes to share a partition with their parent node (i.e. a partition corresponds to a subtree), our algorithm also considers partitions containing several subtrees as long as their roots are adjacent siblings. We call this sibling partitioning.Based on our study of the optimal algorithm, we further introduce two novel, near-optimal heuristics. They are easier to implement, do not need to hold the whole document instance in memory, and require much less runtime than the optimal algorithm.Finally, we provide an experimental study comparing our novel and existing algorithms. One important finding is that compared to partitioning that exclusively considers parent-child partitions, including sibling partitioning as well can decrease the total number of partitions by more than %, and improve query performance by more than a factor of two.|Carl-Christian Kanne,Guido Moerkotte","57594|GECCO|2006|Smart crossover operator with multiple parents for a Pittsburgh learning classifier system|This paper proposes a new smart crossover operator for a Pittsburgh Learning Classifier System. This operator, unlike other recent LCS approaches of smart recombination, does not learn the structure of the domain, but it merges the rules of N parents (N  ) to generate a new offspring. This merge process uses an heuristic that selects the minimum subset of candidate rules that obtains maximum training accuracy. Moreover the operator also includes a rule pruning scheme to avoid the inclusion of over-specific rules, and to guarantee as much as possible the robust behaviour of the LCS. This operator takes advantage from the fact that each individual in a Pittsburgh LCS is a complete solution, and the system has a global view of the solution space that the proposed rule selection algorithm exploits. We have empirically evaluated this operator using a recent LCS called GAssist. First with the standard LCS benchmark, the  bits multiplexer, and later using  standard real datasets. The results of the experiments over these datasets indicate that the new operator manages to increase the accuracy of the system over the classical crossover in  of the  datasets, and never having a significantly worse performance than the classic operator.|Jaume Bacardit,Natalio Krasnogor","57640|GECCO|2006|Non-wrapping order crossover an order preserving crossover operator that respects absolute position|In this paper, we introduce a new crossover operator for the permutation representation of a GA.

It strongly preserves relative order, as does the original OX, but also respects the absolute positions within the parent permutations. This crossover operator is experimentally compared to several other permutation crossover operators on an NP-Hard problem known as weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setups.

Using a distance tailored to the problem at hand, the formal definition of geometric crossover allows to design new problem-specific crossovers that embed problem-knowledge in the search. The standard encoding for multiway graph partitioning is highly redundant each solution has a number of representations, one for each way of labeling the represented partition. Traditional crossover does not perform well on redundant encodings.

For the case of binary tree representations, we present a novel approach for empirically estimating the destructiveness of any crossover operator by computing and summarizing the distribution of Robinson-Foulds distances from the parent to the entire neighborhood of possible children. We demonstrate the approach by quantifying the destructiveness of a popular tree-based crossover operator as applied to the problem of phylogenetic inferencing.
