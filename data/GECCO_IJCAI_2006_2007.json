Such agents will need to be able to learn, both in order to correct and circumvent their inevitable imperfections, and to keep up with a dynamically changing world. They will also need to be able to interact with one another, whether they share common goals, they pursue independent goals, or their goals are in direct conflict. This paper presents current research directions in machine learning, multiagent reasoning, and robotics, and advocates their unification within concrete application domains. Ideally, new theoretical results in each separate area will inform practical implementations while innovations from concrete multiagent applications will drive new theoretical pursuits, and together these synergistic research approaches will lead us towards the goal of fully autonomous agents.|Peter Stone","16747|IJCAI|2007|Context-Driven Predictions|Markov models have been a keystone in Artificial Intelligence for many decades. However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction. Simple examples are given in order to show the advantages of the algorithm.|Marc G.

Properties and processes from natural ecosystems are abstracted and applied to the design of creative systems, in a similar way that evolutionary computing methods use the metaphor of Darwinian evolution to solve problems in search and optimisation. The paper examines some appropriate mechanisms and metaphors when applying artificial ecosystems to problems in creative design. General properties and processes of evolutionary artificial ecosystems are presented as a basis for developing individual systems that automate the discovery of novelty without explicit teleological goals. The adaptation of species to fit their environment drives the creative solutions, so the role of the designer shifts to the design of environments. This allows a variety of creative solutions to emerge in simulation without the need for explicit or human-evaluated fitness measures, such as those used in interactive evolution. Two example creative ecosystems are described to highlight the effectiveness of the method presented.|Jon McCormack","58226|GECCO|2007|A biologically inspired solution for an evolved simulated agent|Biologically inspired designs can improve the design of artificial agents.

This research investigates interactions among selfish, rational, and autonomous agents in resource allocation, each with incomplete information about other entities, and each seeking to maximize its expected utility. This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","16512|IJCAI|2007|Collaborative Inductive Logic Programming for Path Planning|In distributed systems, learning does not necessarily involve the participation of agents directly in the inductive process itself. Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

The paper studies efficient reasoning mechanisms for Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDP) where world states have an internal relational structure that can be naturally described in terms of objects and relations among them. Two contributions are presented. First, the paper develops First Order Decision Diagrams (FODD), a new compact representation for functions over relational structures, together with a set of operators to combine FODDs, and novel reduction techniques to keep the representation small. Second, the paper shows how FODDs can be used to develop solutions for RMDPs, where reasoning is performed at the abstract level and the resulting optimal policy is independent of domain size (number of objects) or instantiation. In particular, a variant of the value iteration algorithm is developed by using special operations over FODDs, and the algorithm is shown to converge to the optimal policy.|Chenggang Wang,Saket Joshi,Roni Khardon"],["57864|GECCO|2006|A GA-ACO-local search hybrid algorithm for solving quadratic assignment problem|In recent decades, many meta-heuristics, including genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) and various local search (LS) procedures have been developed for solving a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Depending on the complexity of the optimization problem, a meta-heuristic method that may have proven to be successful in the past might not work as well. Hence it is becoming a common practice to hybridize meta-heuristics and local heuristics with the aim of improving the overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive GA-ACO-LS hybrid algorithm for solving quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Empirical study on a diverse set of QAP benchmark problems shows that the proposed adaptive GA-ACO-LS converges to good solutions efficiently.

In these networks, the terrain must be covered by a set of base stations (or antennae), each of which defines a covered area called cell. The problem may be reduced to figure out the optimal placement of antennae out of a list of candidate sites trying to satisfy two objectives to maximize the area covered by the radio signal and to reduce the number of used antennae. Consequently, RND is a bi-objective optimization problem. Previous works have solved the problem by using single-objective techniques which combine the values of both objectives. The used techniques have allowed to find optimal solutions according to the defined objective, thus yielding a unique solution instead of the set of Pareto optimal solutions. In this paper, we solve the RND problem using a multi-objective version of the algorithm CHC, which is the metaheuristic having reported the best results when solving the single-objective formulation of RND. This new algorithm, called MOCHC, is compared against a binary-coded NSGA-II algorithm and also against the provided results in the literature. Our experiments indicate that MOCHC outperfoms NSGA-II and, more importantly, it is more efficient finding the optimal solutions than single-objectives techniques.|Antonio J.

In this paper we show that PSO appears to work well on \"single-funnel\" optimization functions. On more complex optimization problems, PSO tends to converge too quickly and then fail to make further progress. We contend that most benchmarks for PSO have classically been demonstrated on single-funnel functions. However, in practice, optimization tasks are more complex and possess higher problem dimensionality. We present empirical results that support our conjecture that PSO performs well on single-funnel functions but tends to stagnate on more complicated landscapes.|Andrew M.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa","57598|GECCO|2006|A comparative study of evolutionary optimization techniques in dynamic environments|Genetic Algorithms have widely been used for solving optimization problems in stationary environments.

As an important branch of learning classifier systems, XCS has been proven capable of evolving maximally accurate, maximally general problem solutions. However, in practice, it oftentimes generates a lot of rules, which lower the readability of the evolved classification model, and thus, people may not be able to get the desired knowledge or useful information out of the model. Inspired by the fault tolerance mechanism proposed in field of data mining, we devise a new XCS framework by integrating the concept and mechanism of fault tolerance into XCS in order to reduce the number of classification rules and therefore to improve the readability of the generated prediction model. A series of $N$-multiplexer experiments, including -bit, -bit, -bit, and -bit multiplexers, are conducted to examine whether XCSFT can accomplish its goal of design. According to the experimental results, XCSFT can offer the same level of prediction accuracy on the test problems as XCS can, while the prediction model evolved by XCSFT consists of significantly fewer classification rules.|Hong-Wei Chen,Ying-Ping Chen","16349|IJCAI|2007|A Subspace Kernel for Nonlinear Feature Extraction|Kernel based nonlinear Feature Extraction (KFE) or dimensionality reduction is a widely used preprocessing step in pattern classification and data mining tasks. Given a positive definite kernel function, it is well known that the input data are implicitly mapped to a feature space with usually very high dimensionality. The goal of KFE is to find a low dimensional subspace of this feature space, which retains most of the information needed for classification or data analysis. In this paper, we propose a subspace kernel based on which the feature extraction problem is transformed to a kernel parameter learning problem. The key observation is that when projecting data into a low dimensional subspace of the feature space, the parameters that are used for describing this subspace can be regarded as the parameters of the kernel function between the projected data. Therefore current kernel parameter learning methods can be adapted to optimize this parameterized kernel function. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.|Mingrui Wu,Jason D. R.

For each team we simulate a number of games and periodically capture the agents' behavioural information from the gaming environment during each simulation. This information is stored in a series of status records that can be later analysed.

This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids.

When requirements and constraints are dynamic, learning agents may be needed to allow for adaptation. One way of accomplishing learning is to observe past outcomes, using such information to improve future decisions. When limits in agents' memory or observation capabilities are assumed, one must decide on how large should the observation window be. We investigate how this decision influences both agents' and system's performance in the context of a special class of distributed resource allocation problems, namely dispersion games. We show by numerical experiments over a specific dispersion game (the Minority Game) that in such scenario an agent's performance is non-monotonically correlated with her memory size when all other agents are kept unchanged.

We argue that the fact that the only entity to access my personal data (such as email) is an artificial agent is irrelevant to whether a breach of privacy has occurred. What is relevant are the capacities of the agent what the agent is both able and empowered to do with that information. We show how concepts of legal agency and attribution of knowledge gained by agents to their principals are crucial to understanding whether a violation of privacy has occurred when artificial agents access users' personal data. As natural language processing and semantic extraction used in artificial agents become increasingly sophisticated, so the corporations that deploy those agents will be more likely to be attributed with knowledge of their users' personal information, thus triggering significant potential legal liabilities.|Samir Chopra,Laurence White","16781|IJCAI|2007|Providing a Recommended Trading Agent to a Population A Novel Approach|This paper presents a novel approach for providing automated trading agents to a population, focusing on bilateral negotiation with unenforceable agreements.

ECGA is designed for handling problems with decision variables of the discrete type, while the decision variables of ED problems are oftentimes real numbers. Thus, in order to employ ECGA to tackle ED problems, SoD is utilized for discretizing the continuous decision variables and works as the interface between ECGA and the ED problem. Furthermore, ED problems in practice are usually hard for traditional mathematical programming methodologies because of the equality and inequality constraints. Hence, in addition to integrating ECGA and SoD, in this study, we devise a repair operator specifically for making the infeasible solutions to satisfy the equality constraint. To examine the performance and effectiveness, we apply the proposed framework to two different-sized ED problems with nonsmooth cost function considering the valve-point effects.

This reduction comes about by a clustering of AA types accordingly to their physical and chemical similarity. Our automated reduction procedure is guided by a fitness function based on the Mutual Information between the AA-based input attributes of the dataset and the protein structure featurethat being predicted. To search for the optimal reduction, the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm (ECGA) was used, and afterwards the results of this process were fed into (and validated by) BioHEL, a genetics-based machine learningtechnique.

Our results show that it is possible to reduce the size of the alphabet used for prediction fromtwenty to just three letters resulting in more compact, i.e. interpretable,rules. Also, a protein-wise accuracy performance measure suggests that the loss of accuracy acrued by this substantial alphabet reduction is not statistically significant when compared to the full alphabet.|Jaume Bacardit,Michael Stout,Jonathan D.

Temporal difference (TD) methods, another approach to reinforcement learning, naturally excel in on-line scenarios because they have selection mechanisms for balancing the need to search for better policies exploration) with the need to accrue maximal reward (exploitation). This paper presents a novel way to strike this balance in evolutionary methods by borrowing the selection mechanisms used by TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolution to choose policies for evaluation.

Recently, it is also used for multi-instance (MI) learning by employing a kernel that is defined directly on the bags. As only the bags (but not the instances) have known labels, this MI kernel implicitly assumes all instances in the bag to be equally important. However, a fundamental property of MI learning is that not all instances in a positive bag necessarily belong to the positive class, and thus different instances in the same bag should have different contributions to the kernel. In this paper, we address this instance label ambiguity by using the method of marginalized kernels. It first assumes that all the instance labels are available and defines a label-dependent kernel on the instances. By integrating out the unknown instance labels, a marginalized kernel defined on the bags can then be obtained. A desirable property is that this kernel weights the instance pairs by the consistencies of their probabilistic instance labels. Experiments on both classification and regression data sets show that this marginalized MI kernel, when used in a standard SVM, performs consistently better than the original MI kernel.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches.

It is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. It requires less labeled data and it makes the test in a lower dimension, which speeds up the testing. Then, we provide a comprehensive comparison between SVM with different kernel functions and I-CFS-EM on several real datasets. This comparison shows that I-CFS-EM outperforms SVM in the sense of both the classification performance and the computational efficiency in the testing phase.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16489|IJCAI|2007|A Theoretical Framework for Learning Bayesian Networks with Parameter Inequality Constraints|The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data. Domain knowledge can come in many forms. For example, expert knowledge about the relevance of variables relative to a certain problem can help perform better feature selection. Domain knowledge about the conditional independence relationships among variables can help learning of the Bayesian Network structure. This paper considers a different type of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian Networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that comes in the form of inequality constraints among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian Network with known structure. These parameter constraints are incorporated into learning procedures for Bayesian Networks, by formulating this task as a constrained optimization problem. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of closed form Maximum Likelihood parameter estimators in the above setting.|Radu Stefan Niculescu,Tom M. Mitchell,R.

The approach deals with categorical data, which consists of a set of gene expressionprofiles belonging to one category, and a set belonging to anothercategory. An evolutionary algorithm (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES) is used to learn an ensemble of classification models distinguishing the two categories, based on inputs that are features corresponding to gene expression values. Each feature is associated with a model-based vector, which encodes quantitative information regarding the utilization of the feature across the ensembles of models. Two different ways of constructing these vectors are explored. These model-based vectors are then clustered using a variant of hierarchical clustering called Omniclust. The result is a set of model-based clusters, in which features are gathered together if they are often considered together by classification models -- which may be because they're co-expressed, or may be for subtler reasons involving multi-gene interactions. The method is illustrated by applying it to two datasets regarding human gene expression, one drawn from brain cells and pertinent to the neurogenetics of aging, and the other drawn from blood cells and relating to differentiating between types of lymphoma. We find that, compared to traditional expression-based clustering, the new method often yields clusters that have higher mathematical quality (in the sense of homogeneity and separation) and also yield novel and meaningful insights into the underlying biological processes.|Moshe Looks,Ben Goertzel,L√∫cio de Souza Coelho,Mauricio Mudado,Cassio Pennachin","57923|GECCO|2007|Hybrid quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm for combinatorial optimization problem|In this paper, a framework of hybrid PSO is proposed by reasonablycombining the Q-bit evolutionary search of quantum PSO and binary bit evolutionary search of genetic PSO.|Jiahai Wang,Yalan Zhou","57976|GECCO|2007|A discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm for the generalized traveling salesman problem|Dividing the set of nodes into clusters in the well-known traveling salesman problem results in the generalized traveling salesman problem which seeking a tour with minimum cost passing through only a single node from each cluster.

We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.|Janusz Marecki,Sven Koenig,Milind Tambe","16759|IJCAI|2007|Using Linear Programming for Bayesian Exploration in Markov Decision Processes|A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge. Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming. We illustrate this approach on a few domains and compare it with other exploration algorithms.|Pablo Samuel Castro,Doina Precup","58016|GECCO|2007|An artificial immune system with partially specified antibodies|Artificial Immune System algorithms use antibodies which fully specify the solution of an optimization, learning, or pattern recognition problem.

Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used -bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A -bit coding scheme as well as a restricted -bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multi-step problems, and function approximation problems.|Martin V.

The potential benefits ofthis procedure are faster and easier learning process as well as the generationof more compact and human-readable classifiers.The dimensionality reduction procedure we propose consists on the reductionof the -letter amino acid (AA) alphabet, which is normally used to specify a protein sequence, into a lower cardinality alphabet. This reduction comes about by a clustering of AA types accordingly to their physical and chemical similarity. Our automated reduction procedure is guided by a fitness function based on the Mutual Information between the AA-based input attributes of the dataset and the protein structure featurethat being predicted. To search for the optimal reduction, the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm (ECGA) was used, and afterwards the results of this process were fed into (and validated by) BioHEL, a genetics-based machine learningtechnique. BioHEL used the reduced alphabet to induce rules forprotein structure prediction features. BioHEL results are compared to two standard machine learning systems. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the size of the alphabet used for prediction fromtwenty to just three letters resulting in more compact, i.e. interpretable,rules. Also, a protein-wise accuracy performance measure suggests that the loss of accuracy acrued by this substantial alphabet reduction is not statistically significant when compared to the full alphabet.|Jaume Bacardit,Michael Stout,Jonathan D.

This paper proposes that facilitating synapses which show a dynamic sensitivity to the changing input may play an important role in compensating for neural delays, through extrapolation. The idea was tested in a modified D pole-balancing problem which included sensory delays. Within this domain, we tested the behavior of recurrent neural networks with facilitatory neural dynamics trained via neuroevolution. Analysis of the performance and the evolved network parameters showed that, under various forms of delay, networks utilizing extrapolatory dynamics are at a significant competitive advantage compared to networks without such dynamics. In sum, facilitatory (or extrapolatory) dynamics can be used to compensate for delay at a single-neuron level, thus allowing a developing nervous system to stay in touch with the present environmental state.|Heejin Lim,Yoonsuck Choe"],["57795|GECCO|2006|The effects of interaction frequency on the optimization performance of cooperative coevolution|Cooperative coevolution is often used to solve difficult optimization problems by means of problem decomposition.

Traditional mask-based crossover operators for binary strings (e.g., one-point and uniform) tend to decrease the diversity of solutions in EMO algorithms while they improve the convergence to the Pareto front. This is because such a crossover operator, which is called geometric crossover, always generates an offspring in the segment between its two parents under the Hamming distance in the genotype space. That is, the sum of the distances from the generated offspring to its two parents is always equal to the distance between the parents. In this paper, first we propose a non-geometric binary crossover operator to generate an offspring outside the segment between its parents. Next we examine the effect of the use of non-geometric binary crossover on single-objective genetic algorithms. Experimental results show that non-geometric binary crossover improves their search ability. Then we examine its effect on EMO algorithms. Experimental results show that non-geometric binary crossover drastically increases the diversity of solutions while it slightly degrades their convergence to the Pareto front.

First runtime analyses of modern search heuristics have been conducted only recently w.r.t a simple Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm called -ANT. In particular, the influence of the evaporation factor in the pheromone update mechanism and the robustness of this parameter w.r.t the runtime behavior have been determined for the example function OneMax.This paper puts forward the rigorous runtime analysis of the -ANT on example functions, namely on the functions LeadingOnes and BinVal. With respect to EAs, such analyses have been essential to develop methods for the analysis on more complicated problems. The proof techniques required for the -ANT, unfortunately, differ significantly from those for EAs, which means that a new reservoir of methods has to be built up. Again, the influence of the evaporation factor is analyzed rigorously, and it is proved that its choice can be very crucial to allow efficient runtimes. Moreover, the analyses provide insight into the working principles of ACO algorithms and, in terms of their robustness, describe essential differences to other randomized search heuristics.|Benjamin Doerr,Frank Neumann,Dirk Sudholt,Carsten Witt","57825|GECCO|2006|On the analysis of the  memetic algorithm|Memetic algorithms are evolutionary algorithms incorporating local search to increase exploitation.

In this paper, we combine the evolutionary computation paradigm with dynamic programming for the application to the NP-hard k-cardinality tree problem. Given an undirected graph G with node and edge weights, this problem consists of finding a tree in G with exactly k edges such that the sum of the weights is minimal.

The first strategy consists of maintaining the same composition of machines during the overall planning horizon, while the second allows performing a different composition for each period. When the decision maker wants to choose the most adequate strategy for its environment, there is a need to control the proposed evolutionary solving approach, due to the complexity of the model.

However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method. In addition to that, the threshold ai is also evolved by mutation between i - aisi, i + aisi in every generation in order to obtain as many association rules as possible. The features of the proposed method are as follows compared with other methods ) Extracts rules without identifying frequent itemsets used in Apriori-like mining methods. ) Stores extracted important association rules in a pool all together through generations. ) Measures the significance of associations via the chi-squared test. ) Extracts important rules sufficient enough for user's purpose in a short time. ) The pool is updated in every generation and only important association rules with higher chi-squared value are stored when the identical rules are stored. We have evaluated the proposed method by doing two simulations. Simulation  uses fixed threshold values that is, they remain fixed at initial thresholds during evolution. In simulation ,thresholds are evolved by mutation in every generation. Fig.  shows the number of rules extracted in the pool in simulation .

The approach deals with categorical data, which consists of a set of gene expressionprofiles belonging to one category, and a set belonging to anothercategory. An evolutionary algorithm (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES) is used to learn an ensemble of classification models distinguishing the two categories, based on inputs that are features corresponding to gene expression values. Each feature is associated with a model-based vector, which encodes quantitative information regarding the utilization of the feature across the ensembles of models. Two different ways of constructing these vectors are explored. These model-based vectors are then clustered using a variant of hierarchical clustering called Omniclust. The result is a set of model-based clusters, in which features are gathered together if they are often considered together by classification models -- which may be because they're co-expressed, or may be for subtler reasons involving multi-gene interactions. The method is illustrated by applying it to two datasets regarding human gene expression, one drawn from brain cells and pertinent to the neurogenetics of aging, and the other drawn from blood cells and relating to differentiating between types of lymphoma. We find that, compared to traditional expression-based clustering, the new method often yields clusters that have higher mathematical quality (in the sense of homogeneity and separation) and also yield novel and meaningful insights into the underlying biological processes.|Moshe Looks,Ben Goertzel,L√∫cio de Souza Coelho,Mauricio Mudado,Cassio Pennachin","16613|IJCAI|2007|Learning by Analogy A Classification Rule for Binary and Nominal Data|This paper deals with learning to classify by using an approximation of the analogical proportion between four objects.

Our investigation shows that the semantic choices are important because they imply different properties, which in turn affect the range of algorithms that can mine for such sets. Of particular interest is the question whether the seminal LCM algorithm by Uno et al. can be upgraded towards multi-relational problems. LCM is attractive since its run time is linear in the number of closed sets and it does not need to store outputs in order to avoid duplicates.

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems. Initial results indicate that the approach improves algorithm performance, especially in problems where the frequency of objective change is high.|Iason Hatzakis,David Wallace","58040|GECCO|2007|Variable selection for wind power prediction using particle swarm optimization|Wind energy has an increasing influence on the energy supply in many countries, but in contrast to conventional power plants it is a fluctuating energy source.

As input variables for this prediction method weather data of a numerical weather prediction model and measured power data from wind farms of several locations in a spread area are used. Additionally a prediction model based on neural networks is described and the results of the new method are compared to the results of the neural network approach. As a result we get a reduction of the prediction error by using the new prediction method. An additional error reduction is possible by using the mean model output of the neural network model and of the nearest neighbour search based prediction approach.|Ren√© Jursa","57670|GECCO|2006|On the effect of populations in evolutionary multi-objective optimization|Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become increasingly popular as multi-objective problem solving techniques.

In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA. During optimization, the effectivity of the gradient techniques is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective operator to spend the most resources. In addition, we indicate how the multi-objective search can be stimulated to also search $mboxemphalong $ the Pareto front, ultimately resulting in a better and wider spread of solutions. We perform tests on a few well-known benchmark problems as well as two novel benchmark problems with specific gradient properties. We compare the results of our adaptive resource-allocation scheme with the same MOEA without the use of gradient techniques and a scheme in which resource allocation is constant. The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

The reconstruction method identified the correct network topology and predicted the kinetic parameters with high accuracy.|Nasimul Noman,Hitoshi Iba","57787|GECCO|2006|Sporadic model building for efficiency enhancement of hierarchical BOA|This paper describes and analyzes sporadic model building, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) and other advanced estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use complex multivariate probabilistic models. With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of (n .) to (n .), where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence nonetheless, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building.|Martin Pelikan,Kumara Sastry,David E.

Different from previous graph-based methods that are based on discriminative models, our method is essentially a generative model in that the class conditional probabilities are estimated by graph propagation and the class priors are estimated by linear regression. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed method is superior to existing graph-based semi-supervised learning methods, especially when the labeled subset alone proves insufficient to estimate meaningful class priors.|Jingrui He,Jaime G.

To achieve convergence, most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms today employ Pareto-ranking as the main criteria for fitness calculation. The computation of Pareto-rank in a population is time consuming, and arguably the most computationally expensive component in an iteration of the said algorithms. This paper proposes a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm which avoids Pareto-ranking altogether by employing the transitivity of the domination relation. The proposed algorithm is an elitist algorithm with explicit diversity preservation procedure. It applies a measure reflecting the degree of domination between solutions in a steady-state replacement strategy to determine which individuals survive to the next iteration. Results on nine standard test functions demonstrated that the algorithm performs favorably compared to the popular NSGA-II in terms of convergence as well as diversity of the Pareto-set approximation, and is computationally more efficient.|Dipti Srinivasan,Lily Rachmawati","57941|GECCO|2007|Inducing a generative expressive performance model using a sequential-covering genetic algorithm|In this paper, we describe an evolutionary approach to inducing a generative model of expressive music performance for Jazz saxophone. We begin with a collection of audio recordings of real Jazz saxophone performances from which we extract a symbolic representation of the musician's expressive performance. We then apply an evolutionary algorithm to the symbolic representation in order to obtain computational models for different aspects of expressive performance. Finally, we use these models to automatically synthesize performances with the expressiveness that characterizes the music generated by a professional saxophonist.|Rafael Ramirez,Amaury Hazan"]]}}
