A process called allocation was proposed to transform a given imprecise fact table into a form, called the Extended Database, that can be readily used to answer OLAP aggregation queries.In this work, we present scalable, efficient algorithms for creating the Extended Database (i.e., performing allocation) for a given imprecise fact table. Many allocation policies require multiple iterations over the imprecise fact table, and the straightforward evaluation approaches introduced earlier can be highly inefficient. Optimizing iterative allocation policies for large datasets presents novel challenges, and has not been considered previously to the best of our knowledge. In addition to developing scalable allocation algorithms, we present a performance evaluation that demonstrates their efficiency and compares their performance with respect to straight-foward approaches.|Douglas Burdick,Prasad M.

This is a classical topic with roots in statistical physics. In recent years, spurred by several applications in unstructured data integration, sensor networks, image processing, bio-informatics, and code design, the topic has received renewed interest in the machine learning, data mining, and database communities. Techniques from graphical models have also been applied to many topics directly of interest to the database community including information extraction, sensor data analysis, imprecise data representation and querying, selectivity estimation for query optimization, and data privacy. As database research continues to expand beyond the confines of traditional enterprise domains, we expect both the need and applicability of probabilistic graphical models to increase dramatically over the next few years. With this tutorial, we are aiming to provide a foundational overview of probabilistic graphical models to the database community, accompanied by a brief overview of some of the recent research literature on the role of graphical models in databases.|Amol Deshpande,Sunita Sarawagi","66270|AAAI|2007|Dominance and Equivalence for Sensor-Based Agents|This paper describes recent results from the robotics community that develop a theory, similar in spirit to the theory of computation, for analyzing sensor-based agent systems. The central element to this work is a notion of dominance of one such system over another. This relation is formally based on the agents' progression through a derived information space, but may informally be understood as describing one agent's ability to \"simulate\" another. We present some basic properties of this dominance relation and demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to a basic problem in robotics. We argue that this work is of interest to a broad audience of artificial intelligence researchers for two main reasons. First, it calls attention to the possibility of studying belief spaces in way that generalizes both probabilistic and nondeterministic uncertainty models. Second, it provides a means for evaluating the information that an agent is able to acquire (via its sensors and via conformant actions), independent of any optimality criterion and of the task to be completed.|Jason M.

Narrative environments dynamically craft engaging story-based experiences for users, who are themselves active participants in unfolding stories. A key challenge posed by interactive narrative is recognizing users' goals so that narrative planners can dynamically orchestrate plot elements and character actions to create rich, customized stories. In this paper we present an inductive approach to predicting users' goals by learning probabilistic goal recognition models. This approach has been evaluated in a narrative environment for the domain of microbiology in which the user plays the role of a medical detective solving a science mystery. An empirical evaluation of goal recognition based on n-gram models and Bayesian networks suggests that the models offer significant predictive power.|Bradford W. Mott,Sunyoung Lee,James C.

Typically, problems are decomposed into concurrent subgoals, allowing increased scalability and state abstraction. An arbitrator combines the subagents' preferences to select an action. In this work, we contrast treating an MRL agent as a set of subagents with the same goal with treating an MRL agent as a set of subagents who may have different, possibly conflicting goals. We argue that the latter is a more realistic description of real-world problems, especially when building partial programs. We address a range of algorithms for single-goal MRL, and leveraging social choice theory, we present an impossibility result for applications of such algorithms to multigoal MRL. We suggest an alternative formulation of arbitration as scheduling that avoids the assumptions of comparability of preference that are implicit in single-goal MRL. A notable feature of this formulation is the explicit codification of the tradeoffs between the subproblems. Finally, we introduce ABL, a language that encapsulates many of these ideas.|Sooraj Bhat,Charles Lee Isbell Jr.,Michael Mateas","66130|AAAI|2007|Uncertainty in Preference Elicitation and Aggregation|Uncertainty arises in preference aggregation in several ways. There may, for example, be uncertainty in the votes or the voting rule. Such uncertainty can introduce computational complexity in determining which candidate or candidates can or must win the election. In this paper, we survey recent work in this area and give some new results. We argue, for example, that the set of possible winners can be computationally harder to compute than the necessary winner. As a second example, we show that, even if the unknown votes are assumed to be single-peaked, it remains computationally hard to compute the possible and necessary winners, or to manipulate the election.|Toby Walsh","65678|AAAI|2006|Improved Bounds for Computing Kemeny Rankings|Voting (or rank aggregation) is a general method for aggregating the preferences of multiple agents.

Unfortunately, Kemeny rankings are NP-hard to compute. Recent work on computing Kemeny rankings has focused on producing good bounds to use in search-based methods. In this paper, we extend on this work by providing various improved bounding techniques. Some of these are based on cycles in the pairwise majority graph, others are based on linear programs. We completely characterize the relative strength of all of these bounds and provide some experimental results.|Vincent Conitzer,Andrew J.

Specific research demonstrates the value of diversity in recommendation lists, shows how users value lists of recommendations as something different from the sum of the individual recommendations within, and presents an analytic model for customizing a recommender to match user information-seeking needs.|Joseph A.

Unfortunately, even approximate planning in POMDPs is known to be hard, and developing heuristic planners that can deliver reasonable results in practice has proved to be a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to approximate value-iteration for POMDP planning that is based on quadratic rather than piecewise linear function approximators. Specifically, we approximate the optimal value function by a convex upper bound composed of a fixed number of quadratics, and optimize it at each stage by semidefinite programming. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive approximation quality to current techniques while still maintaining a bounded size representation of the function approximator. Moreover, an upper bound on the optimal value function can be preserved if required. Overall, the technique requires computation time and space that is only linear in the number of iterations (horizon time).|Tao Wang,Pascal Poupart,Michael H.

In the case of anthrax attack, a delay of hours in making a right decision can lead to hundreds of lives lost. Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision.

However, learning in multi-agent systems does not necessarily involve the participation of other agents directly in the inductive process itself. Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately, or single-agent learning. In this paper we present a new framework, named the Multi-Agent Inductive Learning System (MAILS), that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents. The MAILS framework combines inverse entailment with an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge in a multi-agent setting, facilitating a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates when required.

Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme.

Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables.\" We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than  million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.|Daniel J.

A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications.

In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

To model a service, the user has to specify semantic types of the input and output data it uses and its functionality. As large number of new services come online, it is impractical to require the user to come up with a semantic model of the service or rely on the service providers to conform to a standard. Instead, we would like to automatically learn the semantic model of a new service.

We describe a metadata-based classification method for recognizing input data types using only the terms extracted from a Web Service Definition file. We then verify the classifier's predictions by invoking the service with some sample data of that type. Once we discover correct classification, we invoke the service to produce output data samples. We then use content-based classifiers to recognize semantic types of the output data.

The constrained single-objective optimizer required by the -constraint method, is the cultured differential evolution, which is an efficient approach for approximating the global optimum of a problem with a low number of fitness function evaluations.

In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters.

Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions.

We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets.

Amongst optimisation algorithms driven by evolutionary computation techniques,particle swarm algorithms have proven to be a very good alternative to genetic algorithms because of their faster convergence. However they can still suffer from premature convergence to local optima. Premature convergence occurs when the particles of the swarm are too close to each other to enable further exploration of the space. To put it another way, the dispersion or distribution of the swarm throughout the search space has been localised to a small region with a consequent stagnation of the search process. Many strategies have been used to try to prevent convergence to a local optimum. However little work has been done on problems of high dimensions. By high dimensions, we mean dimensions of  and above.This paper focuses, therefore, on the limitations of classical particle swarm algorithms when dealing with high dimensional problems. We compare different versions of Particle Swarm Algorithms GBest, LBest with ringor random neighbourhood of size citeClerc, and GCPSOciteVanDenBergh. Those algorithmswere run twice, with a linearly decreasing inertia weight, and with the use of a constriction factor.We also used two repulsive-based algorithms Charged PSOciteBlackwell and Predator PreyciteSilva.Our main focus is problems of high dimensionality. In particular, we applied the different algorithmsto the benchmarks functions Ackley and Rosenbrock, in the following dimensions , , .Even though these represent problems of relatively small dimensionality in a real-world context,experiments on higher dimensions have not been necessary to show the limits of the algorithms studied.Each experiment was run  times. The swarm size was chosen from $    $ and so that it isnot greater than the problem size. Each experiment is  iterations long.A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the performance of each algorithms. We found that the LBest algorithms perform significantly better when used with the constriction factor.GBest and GCPSO perform better with linearly decreasing inertia with a small swarm size, but better with the constriction factorwith a big swarm size. The improvement of GCPSO on GBest is not statistically significant in our experiments. The LBest algorithms with the constriction factor seem to be the best algorithms to handle problems of high dimensionality. The LBest algorithm with fixed neighbourhood seems to be less sensitive to the size of the swarm than the LBest algorithm with randomneighbourhood. Especially, in the case of the Rosenbrock function of size , increasing the sizeof the swarm does not improve the performance of LBest with constricted factor and fixed neighbourhood.The algorithms based on repulsion between particles, i.e. Charged Swarm and Predator Prey, do not perform very well.Indeed, even if the predator prey algorithm gives quite good results, it is trapped in a local optimum, as the fitness value stagnates on a constant value for the last % of iterations. This may come from a too low levelof repulsion. Tuning the parameters used for repulsion seems to be very important for high dimensionality problems. Experiments show that almost all the algorithms managed to solve the problems for dimension  butnone of the algorithms managed to solve the problem in the case of problems of dimension  and . The LBest algorithm with random neighbourhood and constriction factor performed the best. Further work will be done on modelling the size of the swarm required to be able to solve the problems.

In principle, we as programmers can provide the agents with the required semantics, but this will compromise the autonomy of the agent. To overcome this problem, we may fall back on natural agents and see how they acquire meaning of their own sensory states, their neural firing patterns. We can learn a lot about what certain neural spikes mean by carefully controlling the input stimulus while observing how the neurons fire. However, neurons embedded in the brain do not have direct access to the outside stimuli, so such a stimulus-to-spike association may not be learnable at all. How then can the brain solve this problem (We know it does.) We propose that motor interaction with the environment is necessary to overcome this conundrum. Further, we provide a simple yet powerful criterion, sensory invariance, for learning the meaning of sensory states. The basic idea is that a particular form of action sequence that maintains invariance of a sensory state will express the key property of the environmental stimulus that gave rise to the sensory state. Our experiments with a sensorimotor agent trained on natural images show that sensory invariance can indeed serve as a powerful objective for semantic grounding.|Yoonsuck Choe,Noah H.

We consider two types of changes namely update and erasure, and we characterize the semantics of these operations on the basis of the approaches proposed by Winslett and by Katsuno and Mendelzon. It is well known that, in general, Description Logics are not closed with respect to updates, in the sense that the set of models corresponding to an update applied to a knowledge base in a Description Logic L may not be expressible by ABoxes in L. We show that this is true also for erasure. To deal with this problem, we introduce the notion of best approximation of an update (erasure) in a DL L, with the goal of characterizing the L ABoxes that capture the update (erasure) at best. We then focus on DL-LiteF, a tractable Description Logic, and present polynomial algorithms for computing the best approximation of updates and erasures in this logic, which shows that the nice computational properties of DL-LiteF are retained in dealing with the evolution of the ABox.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Antonella Poggi,Riccardo Rosati","66142|AAAI|2007|A Logic of Agent Programs|We present a sound and complete logic for reasoning about Simple APL programs.

F-logic has generated considerable interest commercially, in the academia, and within various standardization efforts as a means for building ontologies and for reasoning on the Semantic Web. Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature. We show that, even for queries over meta-information together with data, this problem is decidable for non-recursive conjunctive queries.

As an important branch of learning classifier systems, XCS has been proven capable of evolving maximally accurate, maximally general problem solutions. However, in practice, it oftentimes generates a lot of rules, which lower the readability of the evolved classification model, and thus, people may not be able to get the desired knowledge or useful information out of the model. Inspired by the fault tolerance mechanism proposed in field of data mining, we devise a new XCS framework by integrating the concept and mechanism of fault tolerance into XCS in order to reduce the number of classification rules and therefore to improve the readability of the generated prediction model. A series of $N$-multiplexer experiments, including -bit, -bit, -bit, and -bit multiplexers, are conducted to examine whether XCSFT can accomplish its goal of design. According to the experimental results, XCSFT can offer the same level of prediction accuracy on the test problems as XCS can, while the prediction model evolved by XCSFT consists of significantly fewer classification rules.|Hong-Wei Chen,Ying-Ping Chen","57733|GECCO|2006|Fast rule matching for learning classifier systems via vector instructions|Over the last ten years XCS has become the standard for Michigan-style learning classifier systems (LCS). Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time.

It is well known that, across all possible problems, one algorithm is no better than any other. Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies.

In this paper, we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology and cognition science to database query answering, and study the novel problem of answering top-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical NBA players\", the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players\", the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is often too costly for online query answering on large databases. We develop a series of approximation methods for various situations. () The randomized tournament algorithm has linear complexity though it does not provide a theoretical guarantee on the quality of the answers. () The direct local typicality approximation using VP-trees provides an approximation quality guarantee. () A VP-tree can be exploited to index a large set of objects. Then, typicality queries can be answered efficiently with quality guarantees by a tournament method based on a Local Typicality Tree data structure. An extensive performance study using two real data sets and a series of synthetic data sets clearly show that top-k typicality queries are meaningful and our methods are practical.|Ming Hua,Jian Pei,Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Xuemin Lin,Ho-fung Leung","80780|VLDB|2007|Approaching the Skyline in Z Order|Given a set of multidimensional data points, skyline query retrieves a set of data points that are not dominated by any other points.

In this paper we study k-NN monitoring in road networks, where the distance between a query and a data object is determined by the length of the shortest path connecting them. We propose two methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns, as well as fluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing only updates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the shared execution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections. We experimentally verify the applicability of the proposed techniques to continuous monitoring of large data and query sets.|Kyriakos Mouratidis,Man Lung Yiu,Dimitris Papadias,Nikos Mamoulis","80813|VLDB|2007|Efficient Computation of Reverse Skyline Queries|In this paper, for the first time, we introduce the concept of Reverse Skyline Queries. At first, we consider for a multidimensional data set P the problem of dynamic skyline queries according to a query point q. This kind of dynamic skyline corresponds to the skyline of a transformed data space where point q becomes the origin and all points of P are represented by their distance vector to q. The reverse skyline query returns the objects whose dynamic skyline contains the query object q. In order to compute the reverse skyline of an arbitrary query point, we first propose a Branch and Bound algorithm (called BBRS), which is an improved customization of the original BBS algorithm. Furthermore, we identify a super set of the reverse skyline that is used to bound the search space while computing the reverse skyline. To further reduce the computational cost of determining if a point belongs to the reverse skyline, we propose an enhanced algorithm (called RSSA) that is based on accurate pre-computed approximations of the skylines. These approximations are used to identify whether a point belongs to the reverse skyline or not. Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets, we show that our algorithms can efficiently support reverse skyline queries. Our enhanced approach improves reversed skyline processing by up to an order of magnitude compared to the algorithm without the usage of pre-computed approximations.|Evangelos Dellis,Bernhard Seeger","80622|VLDB|2006|Query Processing in the AquaLogic Data Services Platform|BEA recently introduced a new middleware product called the Aqua-Logic Data Services Platform (ALDSP).

A user may not only propose ad hoc ranking functions, but also use different interesting subsets of the data. In many cases, a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results. Previous work on top-k query processing mainly focuses on optimizing data access according to the ranking function only. The problem of efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections has not been well addressed yet.This paper proposes a new computational model, called ranking cube, for efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections. We define a rank-aware measure for the cube, capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional ranking analysis. Based on the ranking cube, an efficient query algorithm is developed which progressively retrieves data blocks until the top-k results are found. The curse of dimensionality is a well-known challenge for the data cube and we cope with this difficulty by introducing a new technique of ranking fragments.

We posit that data-integration systems need to handle uncertainty at three levels, and do so in a principled fashion. First, the semantic mappings between the data sources and the mediated schema may be approximate because there may be too many of them to be created and maintained or because in some domains (e.g., bioinformatics) it is not clear what the mappings should be. Second, queries to the system may be posed with keywords rather than in a structured form. Third, the data from the sources may be extracted using information extraction techniques and so may yield imprecise data. As a first step to building such a system, we introduce the concept of probabilistic schema mappings and analyze their formal foundations. We show that there are two possible semantics for such mappings by-table semantics assumes that there exists a correct mapping but we don't know what it is by-tuple semantics assumes that the correct mapping may depend on the particular tuple in the source data. We present the query complexity and algorithms for answering queries in the presence of approximate schema mappings, and we describe an algorithm for efficiently computing the top-k answers to queries in such a setting.|Xin Luna Dong,Alon Y.

Alternative query models have been proposed to give users the ability to query the database without schema knowledge. Those models, including simple keyword search and labeled keyword search, aim to extract meaningful data fragments that match the structure-free query conditions (e.g., keywords) based on various matching semantics. Typically, the matching semantics are content-based they are defined on data node inter-relationships and incur significant query evaluation cost. Our first contribution is a novel matching semantics based on analyzing the database schema. We show that query models employing a schema-based matching semantics can reduce query evaluation cost significantly while maintaining or even improving result quality. The adoption of schema-based matching semantics does not change the nature of those query models they are still schema-ignorant, i.e., users express no schema knowledge (except the labels in labeled keyword search) in the query. While those models work well for some queries on some databases, they often encounter problems when applied to complex queries on databases with complex schemas. Our second contribution is a novel query model that incorporates partial schema knowledge through the use of schema summary. This new summary-aware query model, called Meaningful Summary Query (MSQ), seamlessly integrates summary-based structural conditions and structure-free conditions, and enables ordinary users to query complex databases. We design algorithms for evaluating MSQ queries, and demonstrate that MSQ queries can produce better results against complex databases when compared with previous approaches, and that they can be efficiently evaluated.|Cong Yu,H.

This feature is also known as Rollout or Bulk Deletes. Rollout is generally carried out periodically and is often done on more than one dimension or attribute. The ability to efficiently handle the updates of RID indexes while doing Rollouts is a well known problem for database engines and its solution is very important for data warehousing applications. DB UDB V. introduced a new physical clustering scheme called Multi Dimensional Clustering (MDC) which allows users to cluster data in a table on multiple attributes or dimensions. This is very useful for query processing and maintenance activities including deletes. Subsequently, an enhancement was incorporated in DB UDB Viper  which allows for very efficient online rollout of data on dimensional boundaries even when there are a lot of secondary RID indexes defined on the table. This is done by the asynchronous updates of these RID indexes in the background while allowing the delete to commit and the table to be accessed.

An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

Data encryption can be done at multiple tiers within the enterprise. Different choices on where to encrypt the data offer different security features that protect against different attacks. One class of attack that needs to be taken seriously is the compromise of the database server, its software or administrator. A secure way to address this threat is for a DBMS to directly process queries on the ciphertext, without decryption. We conduct a comprehensive study on answering SUM and AVG aggregation queries in such a system model by using a secure homomorphic encryption scheme in a novel way. We demonstrate that the performance of such a solution is comparable to a traditional symmetric encryption scheme (e.g., DES) in which each value is decrypted and the computation is performed on the plaintext. Clearly this traditional encryption scheme is not a viable solution to the problem because the server must have access to the secret key and the plaintext, which violates our system model and security requirements. We study the problem in the setting of a read-optimized DBMS for data warehousing applications, in which SUM and AVG are frequent and crucial.|Tingjian Ge,Stanley B.

Recently, with the increasing use of ontology in various applications, the quest has become more concrete and urgent. However, manipulating knowledge along with relational data in DBMSs is not a trivial undertaking. In this paper, we introduce a novel, unified framework for managing data and domain knowledge. We provide the user with a virtual view that unifies the data, the domain knowledge and the knowledge inferable from the data using the domain knowledge. Because the virtual view is in the relational format, users can query the data and the knowledge in a seamlessly integrated manner. To facilitate knowledge representation and inferencing within the database engine, our approach leverages XML support in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server & IBM DB  PureXML). We provide a query rewriting mechanism to bridge the difference between logical and physical data modeling, so that queries on the virtual view can be automatically transformed to components that execute on the hybrid relational-XML engine in a way that is transparent to the user.|Lipyeow Lim,Haixun Wang,Min Wang","80644|VLDB|2006|SMOQE A System for Providing Secure Access to XML|XML views have been widely used to enforce access control, support data integration, and speed up query answering. In many applications, e.g., XML security enforcement, it is prohibitively expensive to materialize and maintain a large number of views. Therefore, views are necessarily virtual. An immediate question then is how to answer queries on XML virtual views. A common approach is to rewrite a query on the view to an equivalent one on the underlying document, and evaluate the rewritten query. This is the approach used in the Secure MOdular Query Engine (SMOQE). The demo presents SMOQE, the first system to provide efficient support for answering queries over virtual and possibly recursively defined XML views. We demonstrate a set of novel techniques for the specification of views, the rewriting, evaluation and optimization of XML queries. Moreover, we provide insights into the internals of the engine by a set of visual tools.|Wenfei Fan,Floris Geerts,Xibei Jia,Anastasios Kementsietsidis"],["57826|GECCO|2006|PSO and multi-funnel landscapes how cooperation might limit exploration|Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based optimization method in which search points employ a cooperative strategy to move toward one another. In this paper we show that PSO appears to work well on \"single-funnel\" optimization functions.

We contend that most benchmarks for PSO have classically been demonstrated on single-funnel functions. However, in practice, optimization tasks are more complex and possess higher problem dimensionality.

The goal of such a model is to classify examples (records or data instances) into classes or categories of the same type. The use of variables (attributes) not related to the classes can reduce the accuracy and reliability of a classification or prediction model. Superuous variables can also increase the costs of building a model - particularly on large data sets. We propose a discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm designed for attribute selection. The proposed algorithm deals with discrete variables, and its population of candidate solutions contains particles of different sizes. The performance of this algorithm is compared with the performance of a standard binary PSO algorithm on the task of selecting attributes in a bioinformatics data set.

Furthermore, G-PSO adopts a \"reactive\" determination of the step size, based on feedback from the last iterations. This is in contrast to the basic particle swarm algorithm, in which the particles explore the search space by using both the individual \"cognitive\" component and the \"social\" knowledge and no feedback is used for the self-tuning of algorithm parameters.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries.

In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries.

Their execution is typically divided between the federated server and the remote data sources. Outdated and incomplete statistics have a bigger impact on federated DBMS than on regular DBMS, as maintenance of federated statistics is unequally more complicated and expensive than the maintenance of the local statistics consequently bad performance commonly occurs for federated queries due to the selection of a suboptimal query plan. To solve this problem we propose a progressive optimization technique for federated queries called POPFED by extending the state of the art for progressive reoptimization for local source queries, POP . POPFED uses (a) an opportunistic, but risk controlled reoptimization technique for federated DBMS, (b) a technique for multiple reoptimizations during federated query processing with a strategy to discover redundant and eliminate partial results, and (c) a mechanism to eagerly procure statistics in a federated environment.

These graphs may be enriched with weights, associated with the nodes and edges of the graph, denoting application specific desirabilitypenalty assessments, such as popularity, trust, or cost. A particular challenge when considering such weights in query processing is that results need to be ranked accordingly. Answering keyword-based queries on weighted graphs is shown to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we first show that answering queries with further structure imposed on them remains NP-hard. We next show that, while the query evaluation task can be viewed in terms of ranked structural-joins along query axes, the monotonicity property, necessary for ranked join algorithms, is violated. Consequently, traditional ranked join algorithms are not directly applicable. Thus, we establish an alternative, sum-max monotonicity property and show how to leverage this for developing a self-punctuating, horizon-based ranked join (HR-Join) operator for ranked twig-query execution on data graphs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation schemes and the HR-join operator for merging ranked sub-results under sum-max monotonicity.|Yan Qi 0002,K.

This novel context poses an original combination of challenges that has not been addressed before (i) sufficient expressive power of the DL to capture common data modeling constructs (ii) well established and flexible query mechanisms such as Conjunctive Queries (CQs) (iii) optimization of inference techniques with respect to data size, which typically dominates the size of ontologies. This calls for investigating data complexity of query answering in expressive DLs. While the complexity of DLs has been studied extensively, data complexity has been characterized only for answering atomic queries, and was still open for answering CQs in expressive DLs. We tackle this issue and prove a tight CONP upper bound for the problem in SHIQ, as long as no transitive roles occur in the query. We thus establish that for a whole range of DLs from AL to SHIQ, answering CQs with no transitive roles has CONP-complete data complexity. We obtain our result by a novel tableaux-based algorithm for checking query entailment, inspired by the one in , but which manages the technical challenges of simultaneous inverse roles and number restrictions (which leads to a DL lacking the finite model property).|Magdalena Ortiz,Diego Calvanese,Thomas Eiter","80728|VLDB|2007|Mining Approximate Top-K Subspace Anomalies in Multi-Dimensional Time-Series Data|Market analysis is a representative data analysis process with many applications.

Moreover, the time series data correspond to market segments, which are described by a set of attributes, such as age, gender, education, income level, and product-category, that form a multi-dimensional structure. To better understand market dynamics and predict future trends, it is crucial to study the dynamics of time-series in multi-dimensional market segments.

This facilitates the detection of anomalies based on expected values derived from higher level, \"more general\" time-series. Anomaly detection in a time-series data cube poses computational challenges, especially for high-dimensional, large data sets.

Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions.

This paper considers transfer learning with Markov logic networks (MLNs), a powerful formalism for learning in relational domains. We present a complete MLN transfer system that first autonomously maps the predicates in the source MLN to the target domain and then revises the mapped structure to further improve its accuracy. Our results in several real-world domains demonstrate that our approach successfully reduces the amount of time and training data needed to learn an accurate model of a target domain over learning from scratch.|Lilyana Mihalkova,Tuyen N.

Our aim is to respond to the changing environment of video gaming that has resulted from the growth of the Internet, and to provide bug-free programs in a short time. We have already proposed a bucket brigade algorithm (a reinforcement learning method for classifiers) and a procedure for choosing what to learn depending on the frequency of events with the aim of facilitating real-time learning while a game is in progress. We have also proposed a hybrid system configuration that combines existing algorithm strategies with a classifier system, and we have reported on the effectiveness of this hybrid system. In this paper, we report on the results of performing reinforcement learning with different reward values assigned to reflect differences in the roles performed by forward, midfielder and defense players, and we describe the results obtained when learning is performed with different combinations of success rewards for various type of play such as dribbling and passing. In  matches played against an existing soccer game incorporating an algorithm devised by humans, a better win ratio and better convergence were observed compared with the case where learning was performed with no roles assigned to all of the in-game agents.|Yuji Sato,Yosuke Akatsuka,Takenori Nishizono","58220|GECCO|2007|Initial results from the use of learning classifier systems to control neuronal networks|In this paper we describe the use of a learning classifier system to control the electrical stimulation of cultured neuronal networks.

Previously, researchers have developed two types of supervised learning approaches for extracting web data methods that create precise, site-specific extraction rules and methods that learn less-precise site-independent extraction rules. In either case, significant training is required. AutoFeed follows a third, more ambitious approach, in which unsupervised learning is used to analyze sites and discover their structure. Our method relies on a set of heterogeneous \"experts\", each of which is capable of identifying certain types of generic structure. Each expert represents its discoveries as \"hints\". Based on these hints, our system clusters the pages and identifies semi-structured data that can be extracted. To identify a good clustering, we use a probabilistic model of the hint-generation process. This paper summarizes our formulation of the fully-automatic web-extraction problem, our clustering approach, and our results on a set of experiments.|Bora Gazen,Steven Minton","57748|GECCO|2006|A representational ecology for learning classifier systems|The representation used by a learning algorithm introduces a bias which is more or less well-suited to any given learning problem. It is well known that, across all possible problems, one algorithm is no better than any other. Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies. The result is an ecology in which the representations are species.|James A. R.

Natural Language Processing advances in syntax and semantics have made it possible to extract a limited form of meaning from sentences. Knowledge Representation research has shown that it is possible to model and reason over topics in interesting areas of human knowledge. It is useful for these two communities to reunite periodically to see where we stand with respect to the common goal of text understanding. In this paper, we describe a coordinated effort among researchers from the Natural Language and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning communities. We routed the output of existing NL software into existing KR software to extract knowledge from texts for integration with engineered knowledge bases. We tested the system on a suite of roughly  small English texts about the form and function of the human heart, as well as a handful of \"confuser\" texts from other domains. We then manually evaluated the knowledge extracted from novel texts. Our conclusion is that the technology from these fields is mature enough to start producing unified machine reading systems.

Recently, various techniques have been proposed for speeding up these analyses by distributing the link graph among multiple sites. However, none of these advanced methods is suitable for a fully decentralized PR computation in a peer-to-peer (PP) network with autonomous peers, where each peer can independently crawl Web fragments according to the user's thematic interests. In such a setting the graph fragments that different peers have locally available or know about may arbitrarily overlap among peers, creating additional complexity for the PR computation.This paper presents the JXP algorithm for dynamically and collaboratively computing PR scores of Web pages that are arbitrarily distributed in a PP network. The algorithm runs at every peer, and it works by combining locally computed PR scores with random meetings among the peers in the network. It is scalable as the number of peers on the network grows, and experiments as well as theoretical arguments show that JXP scores converge to the true PR scores that one would obtain by a centralized computation.|Josiane Xavier Parreira,Debora Donato,Sebastian Michel,Gerhard Weikum","80842|VLDB|2007|XSeek A Semantic XML Search Engine Using Keywords|We present XSeek, a keyword search engine that enables users to easily access XML data without the need of learning XPath or XQuery and studying possibly complex data schemas.

This structure is incrementally built Each time it is extended, a sequential plan is searched. Different search strategies may be employed. Currently, it is a forward chaining search based on problem decomposition with action sets partitioning. Various techniques are used to reduce the search space, such as memorizing nogood states or estimating goals reachability. In addition, the planner implements two different techniques to avoid enumerating some equivalent action sequences.

Interactive Web search divides the search process into several rounds, and for each round the search engine interacts with the user for more knowledge of the user's information requirement. Previous research mainly uses the text information on Web pages, while little attention is paid to other modalities. This article shows that Web search performance can be significantly improved if imagery is considered in interactive Web search. Compared with text, imagery has its own advantage the time for &ldquoreading&rdquo an image is as little as that for reading one or two words, while the information brought by an image is as much as that conveyed by a whole passage of text. In order to exploit the advantages of imagery, a novel interactive Web search framework is proposed, where image snippets are first extracted from Web pages and then provided, along with the text snippets, to the user for result presentation and relevance feedback, as well as being presented alone to the user for image suggestion. User studies show that it is more convenient for the user to identify the Web pages he or she expects and to reformulate the initial query. Further experiments demonstrate the promise of introducing multimodal techniques into the proposed interactive Web search framework.|Xiao-Bing Xue,Zhi-Hua Zhou,Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang","66048|AAAI|2007|A Planning Approach for Message-Oriented Semantic Web Service Composition|In this paper, we consider the problem of composing a set of web services, where the requirements are specified in terms of the input and output messages of the composite workflow.

We posit that data-integration systems need to handle uncertainty at three levels, and do so in a principled fashion. First, the semantic mappings between the data sources and the mediated schema may be approximate because there may be too many of them to be created and maintained or because in some domains (e.g., bioinformatics) it is not clear what the mappings should be. Second, queries to the system may be posed with keywords rather than in a structured form. Third, the data from the sources may be extracted using information extraction techniques and so may yield imprecise data. As a first step to building such a system, we introduce the concept of probabilistic schema mappings and analyze their formal foundations.

A crucial problem to be addressed in this context concerns the enforcement of selective authorization policies and the support of policy updates in dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel solution to the enforcement of access control and the management of its evolution. Our proposal is based on the application of selective encryption as a means to enforce authorizations. Two layers of encryption are imposed on data the inner layer is imposed by the owner for providing initial protection, the outer layer is imposed by the server to reflect policy modifications. The combination of the two layers provides an efficient and robust solution. The paper presents a model, an algorithm for the management of the two layers, and an analysis to identify and therefore counteract possible information exposure risks.|Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati,Sara Foresti,Sushil Jajodia,Stefano Paraboschi,Pierangela Samarati","80834|VLDB|2007|Self-Organizing Schema Mappings in the GridVine Peer Data Management System|GridVine is a Peer Data Management System based on a decentralized access structure.

In this demonstration, we present a set of algorithms to automatically organize the network of schema mappings.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries. A thorough experimental study evaluates the efficiency of the proposed technique.|Gautam Das,Dimitrios Gunopulos,Nick Koudas,Nikos Sarkas","80674|VLDB|2006|Safety Guarantee of Continuous Join Queries over Punctuated Data Streams|Continuous join queries (CJQ) are needed for correlating data from multiple streams. One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

The demand for such applications, as the market grows, exceeds the capacity of individual businesses to provide fast and reliable services, making outsourcing technologies a key player in alleviating issues of scale. Consider a stock broker that needs to provide a real-time stock trading monitoring service to clients. Since the cost of multicasting this information to a large audience might become prohibitive, the broker could outsource the stock feed to third-party providers, who are in turn responsible for forwarding the appropriate sub-feed to clients. Evidently, in critical applications the integrity of the third-party should not be taken for granted. In this work we study a variety of authentication algorithms for selection and aggregation queries over sliding windows. Our algorithms enable the end-users to prove that the results provided by the third-party are correct, i.e., equal to the results that would have been computed by the original provider. Our solutions are based on Merkle hash trees over a forest of space partitioning data structures, and try to leverage key features, like update, query, signing, and authentication costs.

When overloaded, the system must shed load in order to maintain low-latency query results. In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

Their execution is typically divided between the federated server and the remote data sources. Outdated and incomplete statistics have a bigger impact on federated DBMS than on regular DBMS, as maintenance of federated statistics is unequally more complicated and expensive than the maintenance of the local statistics consequently bad performance commonly occurs for federated queries due to the selection of a suboptimal query plan. To solve this problem we propose a progressive optimization technique for federated queries called POPFED by extending the state of the art for progressive reoptimization for local source queries, POP . POPFED uses (a) an opportunistic, but risk controlled reoptimization technique for federated DBMS, (b) a technique for multiple reoptimizations during federated query processing with a strategy to discover redundant and eliminate partial results, and (c) a mechanism to eagerly procure statistics in a federated environment. In this demonstration we showcase POPFED implemented in a prototype version of WebSphere Information Integrator for DB using the TPC-H benchmark database and its workload. For selected queries of the workload we show unique features including multi-round reoptimizations using both a new graphical reoptimization progress monitor POPMonitor and the DB graphical plan explain tool.|Holger Kache,Wook-Shin Han,Volker Markl,Vijayshankar Raman,Stephan Ewen","80828|VLDB|2007|Processing Forecasting Queries|Forecasting future events based on historic data is useful in many domains like system management, adaptive query processing, environmental monitoring, and financial planning.

This model can be used to define optimization of linear and nonlinear expressions over object attributes as well as many existing query types studied in database research literature. A significant and important subset of this general model relevant to real-world applications include queries where the optimization function and constraints are convex. We cast such queries as members of the convex optimization (CP) model and provide a unified query processing framework for CP queries that IO optimally accesses data and space partitioning index structures without changing the underlying structures. We perform experiments to show the generality of the technique and where possible, compare to techniques developed for specialized optimization queries. We find that we achieve nearly identical performance to the limited optimization query types with optimal solutions, while providing generic modeling and processing for a much broader class of queries, and while effectively handling problem constraints.|Michael Gibas,Ning Zheng,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu","80852|VLDB|2007|Efficient Processing of Top-k Dominating Queries on Multi-Dimensional Data|The top-k dominating query returns k data objects which dominate the highest number of objects in a dataset.

Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme. The proposed scheme reduces Pareto-size and the appropriate number of clusters can usually be determined.|Nobukazu Matake,Tomoyuki Hiroyasu,Mitsunori Miki,Tomoharu Senda","57644|GECCO|2006|A new discrete particle swarm algorithm applied to attribute selection in a bioinformatics data set|Many data mining applications involve the task of building a model for predictive classification.

The approach deals with categorical data, which consists of a set of gene expressionprofiles belonging to one category, and a set belonging to anothercategory. An evolutionary algorithm (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES) is used to learn an ensemble of classification models distinguishing the two categories, based on inputs that are features corresponding to gene expression values. Each feature is associated with a model-based vector, which encodes quantitative information regarding the utilization of the feature across the ensembles of models. Two different ways of constructing these vectors are explored. These model-based vectors are then clustered using a variant of hierarchical clustering called Omniclust. The result is a set of model-based clusters, in which features are gathered together if they are often considered together by classification models -- which may be because they're co-expressed, or may be for subtler reasons involving multi-gene interactions. The method is illustrated by applying it to two datasets regarding human gene expression, one drawn from brain cells and pertinent to the neurogenetics of aging, and the other drawn from blood cells and relating to differentiating between types of lymphoma. We find that, compared to traditional expression-based clustering, the new method often yields clusters that have higher mathematical quality (in the sense of homogeneity and separation) and also yield novel and meaningful insights into the underlying biological processes.|Moshe Looks,Ben Goertzel,Lúcio de Souza Coelho,Mauricio Mudado,Cassio Pennachin","58128|GECCO|2007|Suppression based immune mechanism to find arepresentative training set in data classification tasks|This article proposes a new classifier inspired by a biolog-ical immune systems' characteristic which also belongs tothe class of k-nearest-neighbors algorithms.

With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of (n .) to (n .), where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence nonetheless, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building.|Martin Pelikan,Kumara Sastry,David E.

Moreover, as the number of streams gets larger, our estimator is still computationally simple, but the MLE becomes intractable due to the complexity of the likelihood. Let N be the cardinality of the union of all streams, and &verbarS&verbar be the cardinality of a set expression S to be estimated.

Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used -bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A -bit coding scheme as well as a restricted -bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multi-step problems, and function approximation problems.|Martin V.

The main idea of the approach is to approximate the optimal value function by a Set of basis functions and optimize their weights by linear programming. The quality of this approximation naturally depends on its basis functions. However, basis functions leading to good approximations are rarely known in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach that discovers these functions automatically. The method relies on a class of parametric basis function models, which are optimized using the dual formulation of a relaxed HALP.

We define team activity recognition as the process of identifying team behaviors from traces of agent positions over time for many physical domains, military or athletic, coordinated team behaviors create distinctive spatio-temporal patterns that can be used to identify low-level action sequences. This paper focuses on the novel problem of recovering agent-to-team assignments for complex team tasks where team composition, the mapping of agents into teams, changes over time. Without a priori knowledge of current team assignments, the behavior recognition problem is challenging since behaviors are characterized by the aggregate motion of the entire team and cannot generally be determined by observing the movements of a single agent in isolation. To handle this problem, we introduce a new algorithm, Simultaneous Team Assignment and Behavior Recognition (STABR), that generates behavior annotations from spatio-temporal agent traces. The proposed approach is able to perform accurate team behavior recognition without an exhaustive search over the combinatorial space of potential team assignments, as demonstrated on several scenarios of simulated military maneuvers.|Gita Sukthankar,Katia P.

The optimal actions can now depend on the total reward that has been accumulated so far in addition to the current state. We extend our previous work on functional value iteration from one-switch utility functions to all utility functions that can be approximated with piecewise linear utility functions (with and without exponential tails) by using functional value iteration to find a plan that maximizes the expected total utility for the approximate utility function. Functional value iteration does not maintain a value for every state but a value function that maps the total reward that has been accumulated so far into a value. We describe how functional value iteration represents these value functions in finite form, how it performs dynamic programming by manipulating these representations and what kinds of approximation guarantees it is able to make.

However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) of the time series, the similarity search over directly indexed time series usually encounters a serious problem, known as the \"dimensionality curse\". Thus, many dimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing the dimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods, only Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries, which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initial studies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods, however, show that PLA performs no worse than others. Motivated by this, in this paper, we re-investigate PLA for approximating and indexing time series. Specifically, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced PLA-space, and prove that this function indeed results in a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original time series, which can lead to no false dismissals during the similarity search. As a second step, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds to improve the search efficiency. Our extensive experiments over a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data sets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of PLA together with the newly proposed lower bound distance, in terms of both pruning power and wall clock time, compared with two state-of-the-art reduction methods, Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA) and Chebyshev Polynomials (CP).|Qiuxia Chen,Lei Chen 0002,Xiang Lian,Yunhao Liu,Jeffrey Xu Yu","66248|AAAI|2007|Automatic Algorithm Configuration Based on Local Search|The determination of appropriate values for free algorithm parameters is a challenging and tedious task in the design of effective algorithms for hard problems. Such parameters include categorical choices (e.g., neighborhood structure in local search or variablevalue ordering heuristics in tree search), as well as numerical parameters (e.g., noise or restart timing). In practice, tuning of these parameters is largely carried out manually by applying rules of thumb and crude heuristics, while more principled approaches are only rarely used. In this paper, we present a local search approach for algorithm configuration and prove its convergence to the globally optimal parameter configuration. Our approach is very versatile it can, e.g., be used for minimising run-time in decision problems or for maximising solution quality in optimisation problems. It further applies to arbitrary algorithms, including heuristic tree search and local search algorithms, with no limitation on the number of parameters. Experiments in four algorithm configuration scenarios demonstrate that our automatically determined parameter settings always outperform the algorithm defaults, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. Our approach also shows better performance and greater flexibility than the recent CALIBRA system.

The outcome of this step influences the number of cut out pieces, the amount of material used in the production phase, and the speed of the work order processing. The optimization task is demanding since a number of factors affect production costs and several conflicting criteria can be involved in marker assessment. We consider minimum number of markers per work order as an optimization criterion and transform the problem into the knapsack problem which is then solved with several variants of an evolutionary algorithm.

As the continuous domain does not allow the tight optimality results that are possible in the discrete case (for example by A*), we instead propose and analyze an approximate forward-search algorithm that has the following provable properties. Given a desired accuracy , and a bound d on the length of the plan, the algorithm computes a lower bound L on the cost of any plan. It either (a) returns a plan of cost L that is at most  more than the optimal plan, or (b) if, according to the heuristic estimate, there may exist a plan of cost L of length  d, returns a partial plan that traces the first d steps of such plan.

Exploration time and efficiency are highly dependent on the size and the ruggedness of the search space. For instance, the Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) is not totally suited to traverse very large landscapes, especially deceptive ones. The approach introduced here aims at improving the exploration process of the SGA by adding a second search process through the way the solutions are coded. An \"observer\" is defined as each possible encoding that aims at reducing the search space. Adequacy of one observer is computed by applying this specific encoding and evaluating how this observer is beneficial for the SGA run. The observers are trained for a specific time by a second evolutionary stage. During the evolution of the observers, the most suitable observer helps the SGA to find a solution to the tackled problem faster. These observers aim at collapsing the search space and smoothing its ruggedness through a simplification of the genotype.

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems.

The (+) EA applies global mutations than can reach any point in the search space in one step together with an elitist selection mechanism. Simulated annealing restricts its search to a neighborhood but employs a randomized selection scheme where the probability for accepting a move to a new point in the search space depends on the difference in function values as well as on the current time step. Otherwise, the two algorithms are equal. It is known that the different philosophies of search implemented in the two heuristics can lead to exponential performance gaps between the two algorithms with respect to the expected optimization time. Even for very restricted classes of objective functions where the differences in function values between neighboring points are strictly limited the performance differences can be huge.

The results demonstrate promising performance of the proposed algorithm.|Alfonsas Misevicius","57910|GECCO|2007|A genetic algorithm for resident physician scheduling problem|This paper formally presents the resident physician scheduling problem, which is one of the most important scheduling problems in hospital. The resident physician scheduling problem is characterized as satisfying the fair schedule constraint, the physician specification constraint and the safe schedule constraint simultaneously. To minimize the penalties from violating the constraints, this study adopts the evolutionary approach to propose a genetic algorithm for solving the problems. In addition the well-known genetic operators, this study proposed a new mutation operator called dynamic mutation for solving the resident physician scheduling problem. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in searching optimal schedules.|Chi-Way Wang,Lei-Ming Sun,Ming-Hui Jin,Chung-Jung Fu,Li Liu,Chen-hsiung Chan,Cheng-Yan Kao"]]}}
