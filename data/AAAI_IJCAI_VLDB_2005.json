Although support vector machines (SVMs) have been a dominant machine learning technique for the past decade, they have generally been applied to supervised learning problems. Developing unsupervised extensions to SVMs has in fact proved to be difficult. In this paper, we present a principled approach to unsupervised SVM training by formulating convex relaxations of the natural training criterion find a labeling that would yield an optimal SVM classifier on the resulting training data. The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well. While previous work has concentrated on the two-class case, we present a general, multi-class formulation that can be applied to a wider range of natural data sets. The resulting training procedures are computationally intensive, but produce high quality generalization results.|Linli Xu,Dale Schuurmans","80579|VLDB|2005|Robust Real-time Query Processing with QStream|Processing data streams with Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees is an emerging area in existing streaming applications.

The upcoming release of Microsoft's SQL Server supports XQuery as the query language over such XML data using its relational infrastructure.XQuery is an emerging WC recommendation for querying XML data. It provides a set of language constructs (FLWOR), the ability to dynamically shape the query result, and a large set of functions and operators. It includes the emerging WC recommendation XPath . for path-based navigational access. XQuery's type system is compatible with that of XML Schema and allows static type checking.This paper describes the experiences and the challenges in implementing XQuery in Microsoft's SQL Server . XQuery language constructs are compiled into an enhanced set of relational operators while preserving the semantics of XQuery. The query tree is optimized using relational optimization techniques, such as cost-based decisions, and rewrite rules based on XML schemas. Novel techniques are used for efficiently managing document order and XML hierarchy.|Shankar Pal,Istvan Cseri,Oliver Seeliger,Michael Rys,Gideon Schaller,Wei Yu,Dragan Tomic,Adrian Baras,Brandon Berg,Denis Churin,Eugene Kogan","16057|IJCAI|2005|TimeML-Compliant Text Analysis for Temporal Reasoning|Reasoning with time needs more than just a list of temporal expressions.

Hard as TimeML-compliant analysis is, the small size of the only currently available annotated corpus makes it even harder.

However, comprehensive real data is often hard to come by, and there is no flexible data generation framework capable of modelling varying rich data distributions. This has led individual researchers to develop their own ad-hoc data generators for specific tasks. As a consequence, the resulting data distributions and query workloads are often hard to reproduce, analyze, and modify, thus preventing their wider usage. In this paper we present a flexible, easy to use, and scalable framework for database generation. We then discuss how to map several proposed synthetic distributions to our framework and report preliminary results.|Nicolas Bruno,Surajit Chaudhuri","65390|AAAI|2005|Learning Support Vector Machines from Distributed Data Sources|In this paper we address the problem of learning Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers from distributed data sources.

These techniques represent the input in terms broader characteristics and improve efficiency of various applications, e.g., learning, classification, event detection, among many others. In a recent past, the synopsis techniques have gained more currency due to the emerging areas like data stream management.In this tutorial, we propose to revisit algorithms for Wavelet and Histogram synopsis construction. In the recent years, a significant number of papers have appeared which has advanced the state-of-the-art in synopsis construction considerably. In particular, we have seen the development of a large number of efficient algorithms which are also guaranteed to be near optimal. Furthermore, these synopsis construction problems have found deep roots in theory and database systems, and have influenced a wide range of problems. In a different level, a large number of the synopsis construction algorithms use a similar set of techniques. It is extremely valuable to discuss and analyze these techniques, and we expect broader pictures and paradigms to emerge. This would allow us to develop algorithms for newer problems with greater ease. Understanding these recurrent themes and intuition behind the development of these algorithms is one of the main thrusts of the tutorial.Our goal will be to cover a wide spectrum of these topics and make the researchers in VLDB community aware of the new algorithms, optimum or approximate, offline or streaming. The tutorial will be self contained and develop most of the mathematical and database backgrounds needed.|Sudipto Guha,Kyuseok Shim"],["16169|IJCAI|2005|Learning with Labeled Sessions|Traditional supervised learning deals with labeled instances. In many applications such as physiological data modeling and speaker identification, however, training examples are often labeled objects and each of the labeled objects consists of multiple unlabeled instances. When classifying a new object, its class is determined by the majority of its instance classes. As a consequence of this decision rule, one challenge to learning with labeled objects (or sessions) is to determine during training which subset of the instances inside an object should belong to the class of the object. We call this type of learning 'session-based learning' to distinguish it from the traditional supervised learning. In this paper, we introduce session-based learning problems, give a formal description of session-based learning in the context of related work, and propose an approach that is particularly designed for session-based learning. Empirical studies with UCI datasets and real-world data show that the proposed approach is effective for session-based learning.|Rong Jin,Huan Liu","65433|AAAI|2005|Extending Continuous Time Bayesian Networks|Continuous-time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) (Nodelman, Shelton, & Koller  ), are an elegant modeling language for structured stochastic processes that evolve over continuous time. The CTBN framework is based on homogeneous Markov processes, and defines two distributions with respect to each local variable in the system, given its parents an exponential distribution over when the variable transitions, and a multinomial over what is the next value. In this paper, we present two extensions to the framework that make it more useful in modeling practical applications. The first extension models arbitrary transition time distributions using Erlang-Coxian approximations, while maintaining tractable learning. We show how the censored data problem arises in learning the distribution, and present a solution based on expectation-maximization initialized by the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The second extension is a general method for reasoning about negative evidence, by introducing updates that assert no observable events occur over an interval of time. Such updates were not defined in the original CTBN framework, and we show that their inclusion can significantly improve the accuracy of filtering and prediction. We illustrate and evaluate these extensions in two real-world domains, email use and GPS traces of a person traveling about a city.|Karthik Gopalratnam,Henry A. Kautz,Daniel S.

A Bayesian approach to learning such models from data is taken, with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm being used to approximately sample from the posterior. By only using proposal distributions closely tied to the prior, acceptance probabilities are easily computable via marginal likelihood ratios, whatever the prior used. Our approach is empirically tested by varying (i) the data, (ii) the prior and (iii) the proposal distribution. A comparison with related work is given.|Nicos Angelopoulos,James Cussens","65616|AAAI|2005|Hidden Naive Bayes|The conditional independence assumption of naive Bayes essentially ignores attribute dependencies and is often violated. On the other hand, although a Bayesian network can represent arbitrary attribute dependencies, learning an optimal Bayesian network from data is intractable. The main reason is that learning the optimal structure of a Bayesian network is extremely time consuming. Thus, a Bayesian model without structure learning is desirable. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called hidden naive Bayes (HNB). In an HNB, a hidden parent is created for each attribute which combines the influences from all other attributes. We present an approach to creating hidden parents using the average of weighted one-dependence estimators. HNB inherits the structural simplicity of naive Bayes and can be easily learned without structure learning. We propose an algorithm for learning HNB based on conditional mutual information. We experimentally test HNB in terms of classification accuracy, using the  UCI data sets recommended by Weka (Witten & Frank ), and compare it to naive Bayes (Langley, Iba, & Thomas ), C. (Quinlan ), SBC (Langley & Sage ), NBTree (Kohavi ), CL-TAN (Friedman, Geiger, & Goldszmidt ), and AODE (Webb, Boughton, & Wang ). The experimental results show that HNB outperforms naive Bayes, C., SBC, NBTree, and CL-TAN, and is competitive with AODE.|Harry Zhang,Liangxiao Jiang,Jiang Su","65576|AAAI|2005|Discriminative Training of Markov Logic Networks|Many machine learning applications require a combination of probability and first-order logic. Markov logic networks (MLNs) accomplish this by attaching weights to first-order clauses, and viewing these as templates for features of Markov networks. Model parameters (i.e., clause weights) can be learned by maximizing the likelihood of a relational database, but this can be quite costly and lead to suboptimal results for any given prediction task. In this paper we propose a discriminative approach to training MLNs, one which optimizes the conditional likelihood of the query predicates given the evidence ones, rather than the joint likelihood of all predicates. We extend Collins's () voted perceptron algorithm for HMMs to MLNs by replacing the Viterbi algorithm with a weighted satisfiability solver. Experiments on entity resolution and link prediction tasks show the advantages of this approach compared to generative MLN training, as well as compared to purely probabilistic and purely logical approaches.|Parag Singla,Pedro Domingos","65546|AAAI|2005|Robust Textual Inference Via Learning and Abductive Reasoning|We present a system for textual inference (the task of inferring whether a sentence follows from another text) that uses learning and a logical-formula semantic representation of the text. More precisely, our system begins by parsing and then transforming sentences into a logical formula-like representation similar to the one used by (Harabagiu et al., ). An abductive theorem prover then tries to find the minimum \"cost\" set of assumptions necessary to show that one statement follows from the other. These costs reflect how likely different assumptions are, and are learned automatically using information from syntacticsemantic features and from linguistic resources such as WordNet. If one sentence follows from the other given only highly plausible, low cost assumptions, then we conclude that it can be inferred. Our approach can be viewed as combining statistical machine learning and classical logical reasoning, in the hope of marrying the robustness and scalability of learning with the preciseness and elegance of logical theorem proving. We give experimental results from the recent PASCAL RTE  challenge competition on recognizing textual inferences, where a system using this inference algorithm achieved the highest confidence weighted score.|Rajat Raina,Andrew Y.

Our new method extends a recent advice-giving technique, called Knowledge-Based Kernel Regression (KBKR), that accepts advice concerning a single action of a reinforcement learner. In KBKR, users can say that in some set of states, an action's value should be greater than some linear expression of the current state. In our new technique, which we call Preference KBKR (Pref-KBKR), the user can provide advice in a more natural manner by recommending that some action is preferred over another in the specified set of states. Specifying preferences essentially means that users are giving advice about policies rather than Q values, which is a more natural way for humans to present advice. We present the motivation for preference advice and a proof of the correctness of our extension to KBKR. In addition, we show empirical results that our method can make effective use of advice on a novel reinforcement-learning task, based on the RoboCup simulator, which we call Breakaway. Our work demonstrates the significant potential of advice-giving techniques for addressing complex reinforcement learning problems, while further demonstrating the use of support-vector regression for reinforcement learning.|Richard Maclin,Jude W.

Of particular interest is the way in which new beliefs are acquired and determined and old beliefs are retained or discarded. A parallel can be drawn to symbolic machine learning approaches where examples to be categorised are presented to the learning system and a theory is subsequently derived, usually over a number of iterations. It is therefore not surprising that the term 'theory revision' is used to describe this process Ourston and Mooney, . Viewing a machine learning system as a rational reasoner allows us to begin seeing these seemingly disparate mechanisms in a similar light. In this paper we are concerned with characterising the well known inverse resolution operations Muggleton,   (and more recently, inverse entailment Muggleton, ) as AGM-style belief change operations. In particular, our account is based on the abductive expansion operation Pagnucco et al.,  Pagnucco,  and characterised by using the notion of epistemic entrenchment Grdenfors and Makinson,  extended for this operation. This work provides a basis for reconciling work in symbolic machine learning and belief revision. Moreover, it allows machine learning techniques to be understood as forms of nonmonotonic reasoning.|Maurice Pagnucco,David Rajaratnam","16139|IJCAI|2005|Learning Coordination Classifiers|We present a new approach to ensemble classification that requires learning only a single base classifier.

We argue that the approach is statistically well motivated, even for independent identically distributed (iid) data. In fact, we present experimental results that show improvements in classification accuracy over single-example classifiers, across a range of iid data sets and over a set of base classifiers. Like boosting, the technique increases representational capacity while controlling variance through a principled form of classifier combination.|Yuhong Guo,Russell Greiner,Dale Schuurmans","65490|AAAI|2005|Distribution-Free Learning of Bayesian Network Structure in Continuous Domains|In this paper we present a method for learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) without making any assumptions on the probability distribution of the domain. This is mainly useful for continuous domains, where there is little guidance and many choices for the parametric distribution families to be used for the local conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network, and only a few have been examined analytically. We therefore focus on BN structure learning in continuous domains. We address the problem by developing a conditional independence test for continuous variables, which can be readily used by any existing independence-based BN structure learning algorithm. Our test is non-parametric, making no assumptions on the distribution of the domain. We also provide an effective and computationally efficient method for calculating it from data. We demonstrate the learning of the structure of graphical models in continuous domains from real-world data, to our knowledge for the first time using independence-based methods and without distributional assumptions. We also experimentally show that our test compares favorably with existing statistical approaches which use prediscretization, and verify desirable properties such as statistical consistency.|Dimitris Margaritis"],["65452|AAAI|2005|Non-Stationary Policy Learning in -Player Zero Sum Games|A key challenge in multiagent environments is the construction of agents that are able to learn while acting in the presence of other agents that are simultaneously learning and adapting. These domains require on-line learning methods without the benefit of repeated training examples, as well as the ability to adapt to the evolving behavior of other agents in the environment. The difficulty is further exacerbated when the agents are in an adversarial relationship, demanding that a robust (i.e. winning) non-stationary policy be rapidly learned and adapted. We propose an on-line sequence learning algorithm, ELPH, based on a straightforward entropy pruning technique that is able to rapidly learn and adapt to non-stationary policies. We demonstrate the performance of this method in a non-stationary learning environment of adversarial zero-sum matrix games.|Steven Jensen,Daniel Boley,Maria L. Gini,Paul R.

While successfully tackling key challenges in multi-agent settings, model-based diagnosis has left open the diagnosis of coordination failures, where failures often lie in the boundaries between agents, and thus the inputs to the model--with which the diagnoser simulates the system to detect discrepancies--are not known. However, it is possible to diagnose such failures using a model of the coordination between agents. This paper formalizes model-based coordination diagnosis, using two coordination primitives (concurrence and mutual exclusion). We define the consistency-based and abductive diagnosis problems within this formalization, and show that both are NP-Hard by mapping them to other known problems.|Meir Kalech,Gal A.

The allocator in our model is responsible for the performance of dynamically arriving tasks using a second price reverse auction as the allocation protocol. Since the agents are self-interested (i.e. each agent attempts to maximize its own revenue), previous models concerning cooperative agents aiming for a joint goal are not applicable. Thus the main challenge is to identify a set of equilibrium strategies - a stable solution where no agent can benefit from changing its strategy given the other agents' strategies - for any specific environmental settings. We formulate the model and discuss the difficulty in extracting the agents' equilibrium strategies directly from the model's equations. Consequently we propose an efficient algorithm to accurately approximate the agents' equilibrium strategies. A comparative illustration through simulation of the system performance in a closed and open environments is given, emphasizing the advantage of the allocator operating in the latter environment, reaching results close to those obtained by a central enforceable allocation.|David Sarne,Sarit Kraus","65428|AAAI|2005|Agent-Organized Networks for Multi-Agent Production and Exchange|As multi-agent systems grow in size and complexity, social networks that govern the interactions among the agents will directly impact system behavior at the individual and collective levels.

One way of dealing with the uncertain and dynamic nature of such environments is to endow agents with the ability to modify the agent social network by autonomously adapting their local connectivity structure. In this paper, we present a framework for agent-organized networks (AONs) in the context of multi-agent production and exchange, and experimentally evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of specific AON strategies.

The traditional categorization of self-interested and cooperative agents is unified by adopting a utility view. We illustrate mathematically that the degree of cooperativeness of an agent and the degree of its selfdirectness are not directly related. We also show how OAR can be used to evaluate different negotiation strategies and to develop distributed mechanisms that optimize the performance dynamically.

The agents' collective goal is to minimize the distance between hosts and services, even if the topology is changing constantly.

QBF provides a natural framework for capturing problem solving and planning in multi-agent settings. However, contrarily to single-agent planning, which can be effectively formulated as SAT, we show that a QBF approach to planning in a multi-agent setting leads to significant unexpected computational difficulties. We identify as a key difficulty of the QBF approach the fact that QBF solvers often end up exploring a much larger search space than the natural search space of the original problem. This is in contrast to the experience with SAT approaches. We also show how one can alleviate these problems by introducing two special QBF formulations and a new QBF solution strategy.

It has been shown that a solver based on an encoding of QCSP into QBF can outperform the existing direct QCSP approaches by several orders of magnitude. In this paper we introduce an efficient QCSP solver. We show how knowledge learned from the successful encoding of QCSP into QBF can be utilized to enhance the existing QCSP techniques and speed up search by orders of magnitude. We also show how the performance of the solver can be further enhanced by incorporating advanced look-back techniques such as CBJ and solution-directed pruning. Experiments demonstrate that our solver is several orders of magnitude faster than existing direct approaches to QCSP solving, and significantly outperforms approaches based on encoding QCSPs as QBFs.|Ian P.

Meanwhile, virtually all these problems require classifiers that minimize a nonuniform loss function associated with the classification decisions (rather than the accuracy or number of errors). For example, to train pattern classification models for a network intrusion detection task, experts need to analyze network events and assign them labels. This can be a very costly procedure if the instances to be labeled are selected at random. In the meantime, the loss associated with mislabeling an intrusion is much higher than the loss associated with the opposite error (i.e., labeling a legal event as being an intrusion).

A complicated function (the target function in ML or the fitness function in EC) may require an exponential amount of computation to learnevaluate, and thus approximations by simpler functions are needed. We consider the problem of approximating pseudo-Boolean functions by simpler (e.g., linear) functions when the instance space is associated with a probability distribution. We consider , n as a sample space with a (possibly nonuniform) probability measure on it, thus making pseudo-Boolean functions into random variables. This is also in the spirit of the PAC learning framework of Valiant Valiant,  where the instance space has a probability distribution on it. The best approximation to a target function f is then defined as the function g (from all possible approximating functions of the simpler form) that minimizes the expected distance to f.

Evolino uses evolution to discover good RNN hidden node weights, while using methods such as linear regression or quadratic programming to compute optimal linear mappings from hidden state to output. Using the Long Short-Term Memory RNN Architecture, the method is tested in three very different problem domains ) context-sensitive languages, ) multiple superimposed sine waves, and ) the Mackey-Glass system. Evolino performs exceptionally well across all tasks, where other methods show notable deficiencies in some.|Jürgen Schmidhuber,Daan Wierstra,Faustino J.

This is mainly useful for continuous domains, where there is little guidance and many choices for the parametric distribution families to be used for the local conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network, and only a few have been examined analytically. We therefore focus on BN structure learning in continuous domains. We address the problem by developing a conditional independence test for continuous variables, which can be readily used by any existing independence-based BN structure learning algorithm. Our test is non-parametric, making no assumptions on the distribution of the domain. We also provide an effective and computationally efficient method for calculating it from data. We demonstrate the learning of the structure of graphical models in continuous domains from real-world data, to our knowledge for the first time using independence-based methods and without distributional assumptions. We also experimentally show that our test compares favorably with existing statistical approaches which use prediscretization, and verify desirable properties such as statistical consistency.|Dimitris Margaritis"],["16230|IJCAI|2005|Networked Distributed POMDPs A Synergy of Distributed Constraint Optimization and POMDPs|In many real-world multiagent applications such as distributed sensor nets, a network of agents is formed based on each agent's limited interactions with a small number of neighbors.

We show with computational experiments that the clustering coefficient of the networks within which agents interact is an important condition for efficiency. We also develop an analytical approximation of the simulation model that sheds some light to the original model behavior. Finally, we combine two decision mechanisms, local optimization and imitation, to study the competition between efficient and attractive actions. Our main result is that in clustered networks a society converges to an efficient convention and is stable against invasion of sub-optimal conventions under a much larger range of conditions than in a non-clustered network. On the contrary, in non-clustered networks the convention finally established heavily depends on its initial support.|Josep M.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs.

This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task.

However, in many application domains the classical super solutions framework is not expressive enough since it only reasons about the number of breaks in a solution and the number of changes that are necessary to find a repair. For example, in combinatorial auctions we may wish to guarantee that we can always find a repair solution whose revenue exceeds some threshold while limiting the cost associated with forming such a repair. In this paper we present the weighted super solution framework that involves two important extensions. Firstly, the set of variables that may lose their values is determined using a probabilistic approach enabling us to find repair solutions for assignments that are most likely to fail. Secondly, we include a mechanism for reasoning about the cost of repair.

Our approach clusters local grid maps to identify the possible configurations. We furthermore describe how these clusters can be utilized within a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to localize a mobile robot in a non-static environment. In practical experiments carried out with a mobile robot in a typical office environment, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach compared to alternative techniques for mapping and localization in dynamic environments.|Cyrill Stachniss,Wolfram Burgard","16200|IJCAI|2005|Growth of Motor Coordination in Early Robot Learning|We present an implementation of a model of very early sensory-motor development, guided by results from developmental psychology.

Existing research on scene understanding is typically focused on classifying a scene into classes that are of the same category type. These approaches, although they solve some scene-understanding tasks successfully, in general fail to address the semantics in scene understanding. For example, how does an agent learn the concept label \"red\" and \"ball\" without being told that it is a color or a shape label in advance To cope with this problem, we have proposed a novel research called semantic scene concept learning. Our proposed approach models the task of scene understanding as a \"multi-labeling\" classification problem. Each scene instance perceived by the agent may receive multiple labels coming from different concept categories, where the goal of learning is to let the agent discover the semantic meanings, i.e., the set of relevant visual features, of the scene labels received. Our preliminary experiments have shown the effectiveness of our proposed approach in solving this special intra- and inter-category mixing learning task.|Weiyu Zhu","65410|AAAI|2005|Scavenging with a Laptop Robot|This synopsis presents Harvey Mudd College's entry into the  AAAI scavenger hunt competition.

In order to cope with this problem, a two-sorted counterpart of possibilistic logic is introduced. Pieces of information are encoded as clauses where special literals refer to the weights. Constraints between weights translate into logical formulas of the corresponding sort and are gathered in a distinct auxiliary knowledge base. An inference relation, which is sound and complete with respect to preferential model semantics, enables us to draw plausible conclusions from the two knowledge bases.

However, most approaches define new languages for querying RDF data, which has the following shortcomings ) They are difficult to integrate with SQL queries used in database applications, and ) They incur inefficiency as data has to be transformed from SQL to the corresponding language data format. This paper proposes a SQL based scheme that avoids these problems. Specifically, it introduces a SQL table function RDFMATCH to query RDF data. The results of RDFMATCH table function can be further processed by SQL's rich querying capabilities and seamlessly combined with queries on traditional relational data. Furthermore, the RDFMATCH table function invocation is rewritten as a SQL query, thereby avoiding run-time table function procedural overheads. It also enables optimization of rewritten query in conjunction with the rest of the query. The resulting query is executed efficiently by making use of B-tree indexes as well as specialized subject-property materialized views. This paper describes the functionality of the RDFMATCH table function for querying RDF data, which can optionally include user-defined rulebases, and discusses its implementation in Oracle RDBMS. It also presents an experimental study characterizing the overhead eliminated by avoiding procedural code at runtime, characterizing performance under various input conditions, and demonstrating scalability using  million RDF triples from UniProt protein and annotation data.|Eugene Inseok Chong,Souripriya Das,George Eadon,Jagannathan Srinivasan","16330|IJCAI|2005|Decision Diagrams for the Computation of Semiring Valuations|This paper describes a new approach to computation in a semiring-based system, which includes semiring-based CSPs (in particular weighted CSPs, fuzzy CSPs and standard CSPs) as well as Bayesian networks.

A method is given for generating an SLDD that represents e.g., a particular instance of a semiring-based CSP it is shown how this can be used to perform various computations of interest, such as solving a semiring-based CSP, finding optimal solutions, determining the possible values of each variable and counting solutions of a CSP.|Nic Wilson","65523|AAAI|2005|Markov Decision Processes for Control of a Sensor Network-based Health Monitoring System|Optimal use of energy is a primary concern in fielddeployable sensor networks.

Phases are introduced into a model to represent relevant execution history, but there is no physical manifestation of phases in the real world. We treat phases as partially observable state features and show how a belief distribution over phase configurations can be derived from observable state features through the use of transient analysis for Markov chains. This results in an efficient method for phase tracking during execution that can be combined with the QMDP value method for POMDPs to make action choices. We also discuss, briefly, how the structure of MDPs with phase transitions can be exploited in structured value iteration with symbolic representation of vectors and matrices.|Håkan L. S.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we show that in the current state of the art, DNNF dominates OBDD in efficiency and scalability for some typical diagnostic tasks. This result is based on a step-by-step comparison of the complexities of diagnostic algorithms for DNNF and OBDD, together with a known succinctness relation between the two representations.

Prior work introduced probabilistic, hierarchical, constraint-based automata (PHCA) to allow the uniform and compact encoding of both hard-ware and software behavior. This paper focuses on PHCA-based monitoring and diagnosis to ensure the robustness of complex systems.

This makes such systems particularly interesting because they can tolerate faults, and are able to cope with dynamic environments. We propose the first self stabilizing mechanism for multiagent combinatorial optimization, which works on general networks and stabilizes in a state corresponding to the optimal solution of the optimization problem. Our algorithm is based on dynamic programming, and requires a linear number of messages to find the optimal solution in the absence of faults. We show how our algorithm can be made super-stabilizing, in the sense that while transiting from one stable state to the next, our system preserves the assignments from the previous optimal state, until the new optimal solution is found. We offer equal bounds for the stabilization and the superstabilization time. Furthermore, we describe a general scheme for fault containment and fast response time upon low impact failures. Multiple, isolated failures are handled effectively.

Because in many practical cases, sets of assignments can be represented implicitly and compactly using symbolic techniques such as decision diagrams, the set-based algorithm can compute bounds faster than explicitly searching over individual assignments, while memory explosion can be avoided by limiting the size of the sets. Varying the size of the sets yields a family of algorithms that includes known search and inference algorithms as special cases.

The proposed algorithms search for the speech segment maximizing the average observation probability along the most likely path in the hypothesized keyword model. As known, this approach (sometimes referred to as sliding model method) requires a relaxation of the beginendpoints of the Viterbi matching, as well as a time normalization of the resulting score.

We present here two altemative (quite simple and efficient) solutions to this problem. a) First we provide a method that finds the optimal segmentation according to the criteria of maximizing the average observation probability. It uses Dynamic Programming as a step, but does not require scoring for all possible beginendpoints. While the worst case remains O(LN), this technique converged in at most (L+)N basic operations in each experiment for two very different applications. b) The second proposed algorithm does not provide a segmentation but can be used for the decision problem of whether the utterance should be classified as containing the keyword or not (provided a predefined threshold on the acceptable average observation probability).

In this paper, we propose novel algorithmic solutions for the problem of continuously tracking a broad class of complex aggregate queries in such a distributed-streams setting. Our tracking schemes maintain approximate query answers with provable error guarantees, while simultaneously optimizing the storage space and processing time at each remote site, and the communication cost across the network. They rely on tracking general-purpose randomized sketch summaries of local streams at remote sites along with concise prediction models of local site behavior in order to produce highly communication- and spacetime-efficient solutions. The result is a powerful approximate query tracking framework that readily incorporates several complex analysis queries (including distributed join and multi-join aggregates, and approximate wavelet representations), thus giving the first known low-overhead tracking solution for such queries in the distributed-streams model.|Graham Cormode,Minos N.

Sifting through these documents is time-consuming and sometimes leads to an unsuccessful search. One problem is that most search engines rely on matching a query to documents based solely on topical keywords. However, many users of search engines have a particular genre in mind for the desired documents. The genre of a document concerns aspects of the document such as the style or readability, presentation layout, and meta-content such as words in the title or the existence of graphs or photos. By including genre in Web searches, we hypothesize that Web document retrieval could greatly improve accuracy by better matching documents to the user's information needs. Before implementing a search engine capable of discriminating on both genre and topic, a feasibility analysis of genre classification is needed. Our previous research achieved % classification accuracy across ten genres, whereas similar research range between  and % accuracy. However, the ten genres used in our research were mostly distinct and only exemplar Web documents (consisting of only one genre) were chosen.
