However, much less of such type of work has been done for efficient XSLT processing of XML documents stored and managed by the database. This is partially due to the observation that the rule based template driven XSLT execution model does not fit nicely with the traditional declarative query language processing model which leverages index probing and iterator based pull mode that can be scaled to handle large size data. In this paper, we share our experience of efficient processing of XSLT in Oracle XML DB. We present the technique of processing XSLT efficiently in database by rewriting XSLT stylesheets into highly efficient XQuery through partially evaluating XSLT over the XML documents structural information. Consequently, we can leverage all the work done for efficient XQueryXPath processing in database to achieve combined optimisations of XSLT with XQueryXPath and SQLXML in Oracle XMLDB. This effectively makes XSLT processing scale to large size XML documents using classical declarative query processing techniques in DBMS.|Zhen Hua Liu,Anguel Novoselsky","80710|VLDB|2006|Efficient Secure Query Evaluation over Encrypted XML Databases|Motivated by the \"database-as-service\" paradigm wherein data owned by a client is hosted on a third-party server, there is significant interest in secure query evaluation over encrypted databases. We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan","80712|VLDB|2006|State-Slice New Paradigm of Multi-query Optimization of Window-based Stream Queries|Modern stream applications such as sensor monitoring systems and publishsubscription services necessitate the handling of large numbers of continuous queries specified over high volume data streams. Efficient sharing of computations among multiple continuous queries, especially for the memory- and CPU-intensive window-based operations, is critical. A novel challenge in this scenario is to allow resource sharing among similar queries, even if they employ windows of different lengths. This paper first reviews the existing sharing methods in the literature, and then illustrates the significant performance shortcomings of these methods.This paper then presents a novel paradigm for the sharing of window join queries. Namely we slice window states of a join operator into fine-grained window slices and form a chain of sliced window joins. By using an elaborate pipelining methodology, the number of joins after state slicing is reduced from quadratic to linear. This novel sharing paradigm enables us to push selections down into the chain and flexibly select subsequences of such sliced window joins for computation sharing among queries with different window sizes. Based on the state-slice sharing paradigm, two algorithms are proposed for the chain buildup. One minimizes the memory consumption while the other minimizes the CPU usage. The algorithms are proven to find the optimal chain with respect to memory or CPU usage for a given query workload. We have implemented the slice-share paradigm within the data stream management system CAPE. The experimental results show that our strategy provides the best performance over a diverse range of workload settings among all alternate solutions in the literature.|Song Wang,Elke A.

Interestingly, until now no approach was proposed that is able to represent all of the above data in a single, powerful yet simple data model. This paper fills this gap. We present the iMeMex Data Model (iDM) for personal information management. iDM is able to represent unstructured, semi-structured and structured data inside a single model. Moreover, iDM is powerful enough to represent graph-structured data, intensional data as well as infinite data streams. Further, our model enables to represent the structural information available inside files. As a consequence, the artifical boundary between inside and outside a file is removed to enable a new class of queries. As iDM allows the representation of the whole personal dataspace  of a user in a single model, it is the foundation of the iMeMex Personal Dataspace Management System (PDSMS) , , . This paper also presents results of an evaluation of an initial iDM implementation in iMeMex that show that iDM can be efficiently supported in a real PDSMS.|Jens-Peter Dittrich,Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles","80599|VLDB|2006|FIX Feature-based Indexing Technique for XML Documents|Indexing large XML databases is crucial for efficient evaluation of XML twig queries. In this paper, we propose a feature-based indexing technique, called FIX, based on spectral graph theory. The basic idea is that for each twig pattern in a collection of XML documents, we calculate a vector of features based on its structural properties. These features are used as keys for the patterns and stored in a B+tree. Given an XPath query, its feature vector is first calculated and looked up in the index. Then a further refinement phase is performed to fetch the final results. We experimentally study the indexing technique over both synthetic and real data sets. Our experiments show that FIX provides great pruning power and could gain an order of magnitude performance improvement for many XPath queries over existing evaluation techniques.|Ning Zhang 0002,M.

We show that unlike standard on-line systems, scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will be different than policies that optimize for average slowdown which is more appropriate metric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. We also propose a hybrid scheduling policy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness. We further discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploit sharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs. Finally, we experimentally show using real data that our policies outperform currently used ones.|Mohamed A. Sharaf,Panos K.

In many applications, e.g., XML security enforcement, it is prohibitively expensive to materialize and maintain a large number of views. Therefore, views are necessarily virtual. An immediate question then is how to answer queries on XML virtual views. A common approach is to rewrite a query on the view to an equivalent one on the underlying document, and evaluate the rewritten query. This is the approach used in the Secure MOdular Query Engine (SMOQE). The demo presents SMOQE, the first system to provide efficient support for answering queries over virtual and possibly recursively defined XML views. We demonstrate a set of novel techniques for the specification of views, the rewriting, evaluation and optimization of XML queries. Moreover, we provide insights into the internals of the engine by a set of visual tools.|Wenfei Fan,Floris Geerts,Xibei Jia,Anastasios Kementsietsidis","80701|VLDB|2006|AQAX A System for Approximate XML Query Answers|On-line, interactive exploration of large databases becomes prohibitively expensive as the size of the database grows. Approximate query answering offers a cost-effective solution to this problem, by enabling the fast generation of approximate results based on concise data summaries. We apply this paradigm in the context of XML databases, where the increased complexity of data and queries amplifies the challenges behind interactive exploration. We have developed an on-line XML exploration system, termed AQAX that relies on accurate XML summaries in order to enable the rapid exploration of large data sets. To effectively support the exploration of semi-structured query answers, our system employs a tight coupling between the main query processor and the graphical clients that visualize the results. This demonstration will showcase the functionality of our system and the effectiveness of approximate query answering in the context of XML databases.|Joshua Spiegel,Emmanuel D.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs. It is also robust and bears negligible computational overhead.|Yi-Cheng Tu,Song Liu,Sunil Prabhakar,Bin Yao"],["80669|VLDB|2006|myPortal Robust Extraction and Aggregation of Web Content|We demonstrate myPortal - an application for web content block extraction and aggregation.

However, the task of table extraction from web pages is difficult, because of HTML's design purpose to convey visual instead of semantic information. In this paper, we propose a robust technique for table extraction from arbitrary web pages. This technique relies upon the positional information of visualized DOM element nodes in a browser and, hereby, separates the intricacies of code implementation from the actual intended visual appearance. The novel aspect of the proposed web table extraction technique is the effective use of spatial reasoning on the CSS visual box model, which shows a high level of robustness even without any form of learning (F-measure  %).

Viewing software components as web services, the current solutions to web services composition based on business web services (using WSDL, BPEL, SOAP etc.) or semantic web services (using ontologies, goal-directed reasoning etc.) are both piecemeal and insufficient for building practical applications. Inspired by the work in Al planning on decoupling causal (planning) and resource reasoning (scheduling), we introduced the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the current approaches. The solution is based on a novel two-staged composition approach that addresses the information modeling aspects of web services, provides support for contextual information while composing services, employs efficient decoupling of functional and non-functional requirements, and leads to improved scalability and failure handling. A prototype of the solution has been implemented in the Synthy service composition system and applied to a number of composition scenarios from the telecom domain. The application of planning to web services has also brought new plan and planner usability-driven research issues to the fore for AI.|Biplav Srivastava","65782|AAAI|2006|Automatically Labeling the Inputs and Outputs of Web Services|Information integration systems combine data from multiple heterogeneous Web services to answer complex user queries, provided a user has semantically modeled the service first. To model a service, the user has to specify semantic types of the input and output data it uses and its functionality. As large number of new services come online, it is impractical to require the user to come up with a semantic model of the service or rely on the service providers to conform to a standard. Instead, we would like to automatically learn the semantic model of a new service. This paper addresses one part of the problem namely, automatically recognizing semantic types of the data used by Web services. We describe a metadata-based classification method for recognizing input data types using only the terms extracted from a Web Service Definition file. We then verify the classifier's predictions by invoking the service with some sample data of that type. Once we discover correct classification, we invoke the service to produce output data samples. We then use content-based classifiers to recognize semantic types of the output data. We provide performance results of both classification methods and validate our approach on several live Web services.|Kristina Lerman,Anon Plangprasopchok,Craig A.

Interactive Web search divides the search process into several rounds, and for each round the search engine interacts with the user for more knowledge of the user's information requirement. Previous research mainly uses the text information on Web pages, while little attention is paid to other modalities. This article shows that Web search performance can be significantly improved if imagery is considered in interactive Web search. Compared with text, imagery has its own advantage the time for &ldquoreading&rdquo an image is as little as that for reading one or two words, while the information brought by an image is as much as that conveyed by a whole passage of text. In order to exploit the advantages of imagery, a novel interactive Web search framework is proposed, where image snippets are first extracted from Web pages and then provided, along with the text snippets, to the user for result presentation and relevance feedback, as well as being presented alone to the user for image suggestion. User studies show that it is more convenient for the user to identify the Web pages he or she expects and to reformulate the initial query.

In particular, we show that the per-time-step complexities of iLSTD and TD() are O(n), where n is the number of features, whereas that of LSTD is O(n). This difference can be decisive in modern applications of reinforcement learning where the use of a large number features has proven to be an effective solution strategy.

The agents need to ensure that the service providers they select are trustworthy. Because the agents are autonomous and there is no central trusted authority, the agents help each other determine the trustworthiness of the service providers they are interested in. This help is rendered via a series of referrals to other agents, culminating in zero or more trustworthy service providers being identified. A trust network is a multiagent system where each agent potentially rates the trustworthiness of another agent. This paper develops a formal treatment of trust networks. At the base is a recently proposed representation of trust via a probability certainty distribution. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of two operators, concatenation and aggregation, using which trust ratings can be combined in a trust network. This paper motivates and establishes some important properties regarding these operators, thereby ensuring that trust can be combined correctly. Further, it shows that effects of malicious agents, who give incorrect information, are limited.|Yonghong Wang,Munindar P.

When the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide, we get the ranking systems setting. A famous type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines. Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered. In this paper we define three measures for quantifying the incentive compatibility of ranking systems. We apply these measures to several known ranking systems, such as PageRank, and prove tight bounds on the level of incentive compatibility under two basic properties strong monotonicity and non-imposition. We also introduce two novel nonimposing ranking systems, one general, and the other for the case of systems with three participants. A full axiomatization is provided for the latter.|Alon Altman,Moshe Tennenholtz","65705|AAAI|2006|The Complexity of Bribery in Elections|We study the complexity of influencing elections through bribery How computationally complex is it for an external actor to determine whether by a certain amount of bribing voters a specified candidate can be made the election's winner We study this problem for election systems as varied as scoring protocols and Dodgson voting, and in a variety of settings regarding homogeneous-vs.-nonhomogeneous electorate bribability, bounded-size-vs.-arbitrary-sized candidate sets, weighted-vs.-unweighted voters, and succinct-vs.-nonsuccinct input specification. We obtain both polynomial-time bribery algorithms and proofs of the intractability of bribery, and indeed our results show that the complexity of bribery is extremely sensitive to the setting. For example, we find settings in which bribery is NP-complete but manipulation (by voters) is in P, and we find settings in which bribing weighted voters is NP-complete but bribing voters with individual bribe thresholds is in P. For the broad class of elections (including plurality, Borda, k-approval, and veto) known as scoring protocols, we prove a dichotomy result for bribery of weighted voters We find a simple-to-evaluate condition that classifies every case as either NP-complete or in P.|Piotr Faliszewski,Edith Hemaspaandra,Lane A.

The stochastic nature of the environment plus the stochastic nature of agents' decisions can result in estimates with intractably large variances This paper examines the problem of finding low variance estimates of agent performance. In particular, we assume that some agent-environment dynamics are known, such as the random outcome of drawing a card or rolling a die. Other dynamics are unknown, such as the reasoning of a human or other black-box agent. Using the known dynamics, we describe the complete set of all unbiased estimators, that is, for any possible unknown dynamics the estimate's expectation is always the agent's expected utility. Then, given a belief abcut the unknown dynamics, we identify the unbiased estimator with minimum variance. If the belief is correct our estimate is optimal, and if the belief is wrong it is at least unbiased. Finally, we apply our unbiased estimator to the game of poker, demonstrating dramatically reduced variance and faster evaluation.|Martin Zinkevich,Michael H.

Unfortunately, Kemeny rankings are NP-hard to compute. Recent work on computing Kemeny rankings has focused on producing good bounds to use in search-based methods. In this paper, we extend on this work by providing various improved bounding techniques. Some of these are based on cycles in the pairwise majority graph, others are based on linear programs.

To solve the GMAP, we introduce a novel distributed solution protocol using Lagrangian decomposition and distributed constraint satisfaction, where the agents solve their individual optimization problems and coordinate their locally optimized solutions through a distributed constraint satisfaction technique. Next, to produce quick agreement between the agents on a feasible solution with reasonably good quality, we provide a parameter that controls the range of \"noise\" mixed with an incrementdecrement in a Lagrange multiplier. Our experimental results indicate that the parameter may allow us to control tradeoffs between the quality of a solution and the cost of finding it.|Katsutoshi Hirayama","65673|AAAI|2006|Motion-Based Autonomous Grounding Inferring External World Properties from Encoded Internal Sensory States Alone|How can we build artificial agents that can autonomously explore and understand their environments An immediate requirement for such an agent is to learn how its own sensory state corresponds to the external world properties It needs to learn the semantics of its internal state (i.e., grounding). In principle, we as programmers can provide the agents with the required semantics, but this will compromise the autonomy of the agent. To overcome this problem, we may fall back on natural agents and see how they acquire meaning of their own sensory states, their neural firing patterns. We can learn a lot about what certain neural spikes mean by carefully controlling the input stimulus while observing how the neurons fire. However, neurons embedded in the brain do not have direct access to the outside stimuli, so such a stimulus-to-spike association may not be learnable at all. How then can the brain solve this problem (We know it does.) We propose that motor interaction with the environment is necessary to overcome this conundrum. Further, we provide a simple yet powerful criterion, sensory invariance, for learning the meaning of sensory states. The basic idea is that a particular form of action sequence that maintains invariance of a sensory state will express the key property of the environmental stimulus that gave rise to the sensory state. Our experiments with a sensorimotor agent trained on natural images show that sensory invariance can indeed serve as a powerful objective for semantic grounding.|Yoonsuck Choe,Noah H. Smith","65679|AAAI|2006|Nonexistence of Voting Rules That Are Usually Hard to Manipulate|Aggregating the preferences of self-interested agents is a key problem for multiagent systems, and one general method for doing so is to vote over the alternatives (candidates). Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm"],["80604|VLDB|2006|Scalable Continuous Query Processing by Tracking Hotspots|This paper considers the problem of scalably processing a large number of continuous queries.

Our approach partitions the collection of continuous queries into groups based on the clustering patterns of the query ranges, and then applies specialized processing strategies to those heavily-clustered groups (or hotspots). To maintain the partition dynamically, we present efficient algorithms that maintain a nearly optimal partition in nearly amortized logarithmic time. We show how to use the hotspots to scalably process large numbers of continuous select-join and band-join queries, which are much more challenging than simple range selection queries. Experiments demonstrate that this approach can improve the processing throughput by orders of magnitude. As another application of hotspots, we show how to use them to build a high-quality histogram for intervals in linear time.|Pankaj K.

Efficient sharing of computations among multiple continuous queries, especially for the memory- and CPU-intensive window-based operations, is critical. A novel challenge in this scenario is to allow resource sharing among similar queries, even if they employ windows of different lengths. This paper first reviews the existing sharing methods in the literature, and then illustrates the significant performance shortcomings of these methods.This paper then presents a novel paradigm for the sharing of window join queries. Namely we slice window states of a join operator into fine-grained window slices and form a chain of sliced window joins. By using an elaborate pipelining methodology, the number of joins after state slicing is reduced from quadratic to linear. This novel sharing paradigm enables us to push selections down into the chain and flexibly select subsequences of such sliced window joins for computation sharing among queries with different window sizes. Based on the state-slice sharing paradigm, two algorithms are proposed for the chain buildup. One minimizes the memory consumption while the other minimizes the CPU usage. The algorithms are proven to find the optimal chain with respect to memory or CPU usage for a given query workload. We have implemented the slice-share paradigm within the data stream management system CAPE. The experimental results show that our strategy provides the best performance over a diverse range of workload settings among all alternate solutions in the literature.|Song Wang,Elke A.

All existing methods, however, assume the Euclidean distance metric. In this paper we study k-NN monitoring in road networks, where the distance between a query and a data object is determined by the length of the shortest path connecting them. We propose two methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns, as well as fluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing only updates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the shared execution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections. We experimentally verify the applicability of the proposed techniques to continuous monitoring of large data and query sets.|Kyriakos Mouratidis,Man Lung Yiu,Dimitris Papadias,Nikos Mamoulis","80685|VLDB|2006|Towards Robustness in Query Auditing|We consider the online query auditing problem for statistical databases.

When overloaded, the system must shed load in order to maintain low-latency query results. In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

We also propose a hybrid scheduling policy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness. We further discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploit sharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs.

Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature.

Applications such as endsystem-based network management are characterized by data stored on large numbers of endsystems, with frequent local updates and relatively infrequent global one-shot queries. The challenges are scale ( to  endsystems) and endsystem unavailability. In such large systems, a significant fraction of endsystems and their data will be unavailable at any given time. Existing methods to provide high data availability despite endsystem unavailability involve centralizing, redistributing or replicating the data. At large scale these methods are not scalable. We advocate a design that trades query delay for completeness, incrementally returning results as endsystems become available. We also introduce the idea of completeness prediction, which provides the user with explicit feedback about this delaycompleteness trade-off. Completeness prediction is based on replication of compact data summaries and availability models. This metadata is orders of magnitude smaller than the data. Seaweed is a scalable query infrastructure supporting incremental results, online in-network aggregation and completeness prediction. It is built on a distributed hash table (DHT) but unlike previous DHT based approaches it does not redistribute data across the network. It exploits the DHT infrastructure for failure-resilient metadata replication, query dissemination, and result aggregation. We analytically compare Seaweed's scalability against other approaches and also evaluate the Seaweed prototype running on a large-scale network simulator driven by real-world traces.|Dushyanth Narayanan,Austin Donnelly,Richard Mortier,Antony I.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs. It is also robust and bears negligible computational overhead.|Yi-Cheng Tu,Song Liu,Sunil Prabhakar,Bin Yao"],["80607|VLDB|2006|On Biased Reservoir Sampling in the Presence of Stream Evolution|The method of reservoir based sampling is often used to pick an unbiased sample from a data stream. A large portion of the unbiased sample may become less relevant over time because of evolution. An analytical or mining task (eg. query estimation) which is specific to only the sample points from a recent time-horizon may provide a very inaccurate result. This is because the size of the relevant sample reduces with the horizon itself. On the other hand, this is precisely the most important case for data stream algorithms, since recent history is frequently analyzed. In such cases, we show that an effective solution is to bias the sample with the use of temporal bias functions. The maintenance of such a sample is non-trivial, since it needs to be dynamically maintained, without knowing the total number of points in advance. We prove some interesting theoretical properties of a large class of memory-less bias functions, which allow for an efficient implementation of the sampling algorithm. We also show that the inclusion of bias in the sampling process introduces a maximum requirement on the reservoir size. This is a nice property since it shows that it may often be possible to maintain the maximum relevant sample with limited storage requirements. We not only illustrate the advantages of the method for the problem of query estimation, but also show that the approach has applicability to broader data mining problems such as evolution analysis and classification.|Charu C.

Schema mappings are fundamental components for both data exchange and data integration. To date, a language for specifying (or programming) schema mappings exists. However, developmental support for programming schema mappings is still lacking. In particular, a tool for debugging schema mappings has not yet been developed. In this paper, we propose to build a debugger for understanding and exploring schema mappings. We present a primary feature of our debugger, called routes, that describes the relationship between source and target data with the schema mapping. We present two algorithms for computing all routes or one route for selected target data. Both algorithms execute in polynomial time in the size of the input. In computing all routes, our algorithm produces a concise representation that factors common steps in the routes. Furthermore, every minimal route for the selected data can, essentially, be found in this representation. Our second algorithm is able to produce one route fast, if there is one, and alternative routes as needed.

When the number of dimension attributes is n, the data cube computes n group-bys, each of which is called a cuboid. A data cube is often precomputed and stored as materialized views in data warehouses. The data cube needs to be updated when source relations change. The incremental maintenance of a data cube is to compute and propagate only changes of source relations rather than recompute the entire data cube from the source relations.To maintain a data cube incrementally, previous methods compute a delta cube which represents the change of the data cube. We call a cuboid in a delta cube a delta cuboid. For a data cube with n cuboids, a delta cube consists of n delta cuboids. Thus, as the number of dimension attributes increases, the cost of computing the delta cube increases significantly. In this paper, we propose an incremental maintenance method for data cubes that can maintain a data cube by using only (n n) delta cuboids. As a result, the cost of computing delta cuboids is substantially reduced.

One approach to monitoring such systems is to \"sniff\" these distributed logs and to store their transformed content in a DBMS. This centralizes the state and exposes it for querying unfortunately, it also creates uncertainty with respect to the recency and consistency of the data. Previous related work has focused on allowing queries to express currency and consistency constraints, which are then enforced by \"pulling\" data from the distributed sources on demand, or by requiring synchronous updates of a centralized data store. In some instances this is impossible due to legacy system issues or inefficient as the system scales to large numbers of processors. Accordingly, we propose that instead of enforcing consistency and recency, such monitoring systems should report these properties along with query results, with the hope that this will allow the data to be appropriately interpreted. We present techniques for reporting consistency and recency for queries and evaluate them with respect to efficiency and precision.

These reports, collected in a passive surveillance mode, contain multi-dimensional, heterogeneous and sparse snippets of spedfic information about the consumers' demographics, the kinds, brands and sources of the food involved, symptoms of possible sickness, characteristics of foreign objects which could have been found in food, involved locations and times of occurrences, etc. Statistical data mining component of the system empowers its users, allowing for increased accuracy, specificity and timeliness of detection of naturally occurring problems as well as of potential acts of agro-terrorism. The system's main purpose is to enhance discovery and mitigation of food borne threats to public health in the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service regulated products. As such, it is being envisioned as one of the key components of the nationwide biosecurity protection infrastructure. It has been accepted for use and it is currently going through the final stages of deployment.

Among the methods proposed are Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE), Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) and Local Discriminant Embedding (LDE) which have been used in such applications as face recognition and imagevideo retrieval. However, although the data in these applications are more naturally represented as higher-order tensors, the embedding methods can only work with vectorized data representations which may not capture well some useful information in the original data. Moreover, high-dimensional vectorized representations also suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the high computational demand. In this paper, we propose some novel tensor embedding methods which, unlike previous methods, take data directly in the form of tensors of arbitrary order as input. These methods allow the relationships between dimensions of a tensor representation to be efficiently characterized. Moreover, they also allow the intrinsic local geometric and topological properties of the manifold embedded in a tensor space to be naturally estimated. Furthermore, they do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the high computational demand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tensor embedding methods on a face recognition application and compare them with some previous methods. Extensive experiments show that our methods are not only more effective but also more efficient.|Guang Dai,Dit-Yan Yeung","65831|AAAI|2006|CM-Extractor An Application for Automating Medical Quality Measures Abstraction in a Hospital Setting|In the US, health care providers are required to report evidence-based quality measures to various governmental and independent regulatory agencies.

Many complex engineered systems comprise embedded features to perform self-diagnosis or self-reconfiguration. These features require fast response times in order to be useful in domains where embedded systems are typically deployed. Researchers often advocate the use of compilation-based approaches to store the set of environments (resp. solutions) to a diagnosis (resp. reconfiguration) problem, in some compact representation. However, the size of a compiled representation may be exponential in the treewidth of the problem. In this paper we propose a novel method for compiling the most preferred environments in order to reduce the large space requirements of our compiled representation. We show that approximate compilation is an effective means of generating the highest-valued environments, while obtaining a representation whose size can be tailored to any embedded application. The method also provides a graceful way to tradeoff space requirements with the completeness of our coverage of the environment space.|Barry O'Sullivan,Gregory M.

Recent advances in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have made use of the quickly spreading nature of these attacks to identify them with high sensitivity and at low false positive (FP) rates. However, slowly propagating attacks are much more difficult to detect because they are cloaked under the veil of normal network traffic, yet can be just as dangerous due to their exponential spread pattern. We extend the idea of using collaborative IDSs to corroborate the likelihood of attack by imbuing end hosts with probabilistic graphical models and using random messaging to gossip state among peer detectors. We show that such a system is able to boost a weak anomaly detector D to detect an order-of-magnitude slower worm, at false positive rates less than a few per week, than would be possible using D alone at the end-host or on a network aggregation point. We show that this general architecture is scalable in the sense that a fixed absolute false positive rate can be achieved as the network size grows, spreads communication bandwidth uniformly throughout the network, and makes use of the increased computation power of a distributed system. We argue that using probabilistic models provides more robust detections than previous collaborative counting schemes and allows the system to account for heterogeneous detectors in a principled fashion.|Denver Dash,Branislav Kveton,John Mark Agosta,Eve M.

We often have daily counts of some variable that are indicative of the number of individuals in a given community becoming sick each day with a particular disease. By monitoring these daily counts we can possibly detect an outbreak in an early stage. A number of classical time-series methods have been applied to outbreak detection based on monitoring daily counts of some variables. These classical methods only give us an alert as to whether there may be an outbreak. They do not predict properties of the outbreak such as its size, duration, and how far we are into the outbreak. Knowing the probable values of these variables can help guide us to a cost-effective decision that maximizes expected utility. Bayesian networks have become one of the most prominent architectures for reasoning under uncertainty in artificial intelligence. We present an intelligent system, implemented using a Bayesian network, which not only detects an outbreak, but predicts its size and duration, and estimates how far we are into the outbreak. We show results of investigating the performance of the system using simulated outbreaks based on real outbreak data. These results indicate that the system shows promise of being able to predict properties of an outbreak.|Xia Jiang,Garrick L.

Unfortunately, even approximate planning in POMDPs is known to be hard, and developing heuristic planners that can deliver reasonable results in practice has proved to be a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to approximate value-iteration for POMDP planning that is based on quadratic rather than piecewise linear function approximators. Specifically, we approximate the optimal value function by a convex upper bound composed of a fixed number of quadratics, and optimize it at each stage by semidefinite programming. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive approximation quality to current techniques while still maintaining a bounded size representation of the function approximator. Moreover, an upper bound on the optimal value function can be preserved if required. Overall, the technique requires computation time and space that is only linear in the number of iterations (horizon time).|Tao Wang,Pascal Poupart,Michael H.

A number of optimal basis functions are determined by the algorithm to minimize the Bellman residual incrementally, via efficient computations. We show that, by using optimally determined basis functions, the policy can be improved successively on a set of most probable belief points sampled from the reachable belief set. As the ILSPI is based on belief sample points, it represents a point-based policy iteration method.

First, credit must be assigned for an action taken at time step t that results in a reward at time step t  t. Second, credit must be assigned for the contribution of agent i to the overall system performance. The first credit assignment problem is typically addressed with temporal difference methods such as Q-learning.

In most real-world problems, learning this value function requires a function approximator, which maps state-action pairs to values via a concise, parameterized function. In practice, the success of function approximators depends on the ability of the human designer to select an appropriate representation for the value function. A recently developed approach called evolutionary function approximation uses evolutionary computation to automate the search for effective representations. While this approach can substantially improve the performance of TD methods, it requires many sample episodes to do so. We present an enhancement to evolutionary function approximation that makes it much more sample-efficient by exploiting the off-policy nature of certain TD methods. Empirical results in a server job scheduling domain demonstrate that the enhanced method can learn better policies than evolution or TD methods alone and can do so in many fewer episodes than standard evolutionary function approximation.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone","65731|AAAI|2006|Active Learning with Near Misses|Assume that we are trying to build a visual recognizer for a particular class of objects--chairs, for example--using existing induction methods.

Previous approaches to the HIPP problem have focused on integer programming models and branch-and-bound algorithms. In contrast, this paper proposes the utilization of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). The proposed solution entails a SAT model, a number of key pruning techniques, and an iterative algorithm that enumerates the possible solution values for the target optimization problem. Experimental results, obtained on a wide range of instances, demonstrate that the SAT-based approach can be several orders of magnitude faster than existing solutions. Besides being more efficient, the SAT-based approach is also the only capable of computing the solution for a large number of instances.|InÃªs Lynce,JoÃ£o Marques-Silva","65681|AAAI|2006|Adaptive Sampling Based Large-Scale Stochastic Resource Control|We consider closed-loop solutions to stochastic optimization problems of resource allocation type. They concern with the dynamic allocation of reusable resources over time to non-preemtive interconnected tasks with stochastic durations. The aim is to minimize the expected value of a regular performance measure. First, we formulate the problem as a stochastic shortest path problem and argue that our formulation has favorable properties, e.g., it has finite horizon, it is acyclic, thus, all policies are proper, and moreover, the space of control policies can be safely restricted. Then, we propose an iterative solution. Essentially, we apply a reinforcement learning based adaptive sampler to compute a sub-optimal control policy. We suggest several approaches to enhance this solution and make it applicable to large-scale problems. The main improvements are () the value function is maintained by feature-based support vector regression () the initial exploration is guided by rollout algorithms () the state space is partitioned by clustering the tasks while keeping the precedence constraints satisfied () the action space is decomposed and, consequently, the number of available actions in a state is decreased and, finally, () we argue that the sampling can be effectively distributed among several processors. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by experimental results on both artificial (benchmark) and real-world (industry related) data.|BalÃ¡zs CsanÃ¡d CsÃ¡ji,LÃ¡szlÃ³ Monostori","65843|AAAI|2006|Strategy Variations in Analogical Problem Solving|While it is commonly agreed that analogy is useful in human problem solving, exactly how analogy can and should be used remains an intriguing problem. VanLehn () for instance argues that there are differences in how novices and experts use analogy, but the VanLehn and Jones () Cascade model does not implement these differences. This paper analyzes several variations in strategies for using analogy to explore possible sources of noviceexpert differences. We describe a series of ablation experiments on an expert model to examine the effects of strategy variations in using analogy in problem solving. We provide evidence that failing to use qualitative reasoning when encoding problems, being careless in validating analogical inferences, and not using multiple retrievals can degrade the efficiency of problem-solving.|Tom Y.

We adapt the classical notion of set bounds consistency for WCSPs, and propose efficient representation schemes for set variables and common unary, binary, and ternary set constraints, as well as cardinality constraints. Instead of reasoning consistency on an entire set variable directly, we propose local consistency check at the set element level, and demonstrate that this apparent \"micro\"-management of consistency does imply set bounds consistency at the variable level. In addition, we prove that our framework captures classical CSPs with set variables, and degenerates to the classical case when the weights in the problem contain only  and T. Last but not least, we verify the feasibility and efficiency of our proposal with a prototype implementation, the efficiency of which is competitive against ILOG Solver on classical problems and orders of magnitude better than WCSP models using - variables to simulate set variables on soft problems.|J.

Our problem domain is also a generalization of the well-known Sudoku puzzle we consider Sudoku instances of arbitrary order, with the additional generalization that the block regions can have rectangular shape, in addition to the standard square shape. We evaluate the computational hardness of Generalized Sudoku instances, for different parameter settings. Our experimental hardness results show that we can generate instances that are considerably harder than QCPQWH instances of the same size. More interestingly, we show the impact of different balancing strategies on problem hardness.

The expected first hitting time is one of the most important theoretical issues of evolutionary algorithms, since it implies the average computational time complexity. In this paper, we establish a bridge between the expected first hitting time and another important theoretical issue, i.e., convergence rate. Through this bridge, we propose a new general approach to estimating the expected first hitting time. Using this approach, we analyze EAs with different configurations, including three mutation operators, withwithout population, a recombination operator and a time variant mutation operator, on a hard problem. The results show that the proposed approach is helpful for analyzing a broad range of evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we give an explanation of what makes a problem hard to EAs, and based on the recognition, we prove the hardness of a general problem.|Yang Yu,Zhi-Hua Zhou","65722|AAAI|2006|Exploiting Tree Decomposition and Soft Local Consistency In Weighted CSP|Several recent approaches for processing graphical models (constraint and Bayesian networks) simultaneously exploit graph decomposition and local consistency enforcing. Graph decomposition exploits the problem structure and offers space and time complexity bounds while hard information propagation provides practical improvements of space and time behavior inside these theoretical bounds. Concurrently, the extension of local consistency to weighted constraint networks has led to important improvements in branch and bound based solvers. Indeed, soft local consistencies give incrementally computed strong lower bounds providing inexpensive yet powerful pruning and better informed heuristics. In this paper, we consider combinations of tree decomposition based approaches and soft local consistency enforcing for solving weighted constraint problems. The intricacy of weighted information processing leads to different approaches, with different theoretical properties. It appears that the most promising combination sacrifices a bit of theory for improved practical efficiency.|Simon de Givry,Thomas Schiex,GÃ©rard Verfaillie","65666|AAAI|2006|B-ROC Curves for the Assessment of Classifiers over Imbalanced Data Sets|The class imbalance problem appears to be ubiquitous to a large portion of the machine learning and data mining communities.

One important voting rule is the Slater rule. It selects a ranking of the alternatives (or candidates) to minimize the number of pairs of candidates such that the ranking disagrees with the pairwise majority vote on these two candidates. The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates. We show that this technique suffices to compute a Slater ranking in linear time if the pairwise majority graph is hierarchically structured. For the general case, we also give an efficient algorithm for finding a set of similar candidates. We provide experimental results that show that this technique significantly (sometimes drastically) speeds up search algorithms, Finally, we also use the technique of similar sets to show that computing an optimal Slater ranking is NP-hard. even in the absence of pairwise ties.|Vincent Conitzer","65757|AAAI|2006|Diagnosis of Multi-Robot Coordination Failures Using Distributed CSP Algorithms|With increasing deployment of systems involving multiple coordinating agents, there is a growing need for diagnosing coordination failures in such systems.

In this paper we propose a distributed approach to model-based coordination failure diagnosis. We model the coordination between the agents as a constraint graph, and adapt several algorithms from the distributed CSP area, to use as the basis for the diagnosis algorithms. We evaluate the algorithms in extensive experiments with simulated and real Sony Aibo robots and show that in general a trade-off exists between the computational requirements of the algorithms, and their diagnosis results. Surprisingly, in contrast to results in distributed CSPs, the asynchronous backtracking algorithm outperforms stochastic local search in terms of both quality and runtime.|Meir Kalech,Gal A.

When the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide, we get the ranking systems setting. A famous type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines. Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered. In this paper we define three measures for quantifying the incentive compatibility of ranking systems. We apply these measures to several known ranking systems, such as PageRank, and prove tight bounds on the level of incentive compatibility under two basic properties strong monotonicity and non-imposition. We also introduce two novel nonimposing ranking systems, one general, and the other for the case of systems with three participants.

We obtain both polynomial-time bribery algorithms and proofs of the intractability of bribery, and indeed our results show that the complexity of bribery is extremely sensitive to the setting. For example, we find settings in which bribery is NP-complete but manipulation (by voters) is in P, and we find settings in which bribing weighted voters is NP-complete but bribing voters with individual bribe thresholds is in P. For the broad class of elections (including plurality, Borda, k-approval, and veto) known as scoring protocols, we prove a dichotomy result for bribery of weighted voters We find a simple-to-evaluate condition that classifies every case as either NP-complete or in P.|Piotr Faliszewski,Edith Hemaspaandra,Lane A.

In contrast, our approach is to allow an agent to impersonate several different agents. We design the mechanisms such that only a limited set of impersonations are reasonable to rational agents. Our mechanisms make sure that for any choice of such impersonations by the agents, an approximation to the social welfare is achieved. We demonstrate our results on the well studied domain of Combinatorial Auctions (CA).

However, learning in multi-agent systems does not necessarily involve the participation of other agents directly in the inductive process itself. Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately, or single-agent learning. In this paper we present a new framework, named the Multi-Agent Inductive Learning System (MAILS), that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents. The MAILS framework combines inverse entailment with an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge in a multi-agent setting, facilitating a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates when required. The benefits of the new approach are demonstrated for inducing declarative program fragments in a multi-agent distributed programming system.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm","65933|AAAI|2006|Hard Constrained Semi-Markov Decision Processes|In multiple criteria Markov Decision Processes (MDP) where multiple costs are incurred at every decision point, current methods solve them by minimising the expected primary cost criterion while constraining the expectations of other cost criteria to some critical values. However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted. Based on the semi-MDP (sMDP) model, we study the hard constrained (HC) problem in continuous time, state and action spaces with respect to both finite and infinite horizons, and various cost criteria. We show that the HCsMDP problem is NP-hard and that there exists an equivalent discrete-time MDP to every HCsMDP. Hence, classical methods such as reinforcement learning can solve HCsMDPs.|Wai-Leong Yeow,Chen-Khong Tham,Wai-Choong Wong","65652|AAAI|2006|An Iterative Algorithm for Solving Constrained Decentralized Markov Decision Processes|Despite the significant progress to extend Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to cooperative multi-agent systems, developing approaches that can deal with realistic problems remains a serious challenge. Existing approaches that solve Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) suffer from the fact that they can only solve relatively small problems without complex constraints on task execution. OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings.

To model a service, the user has to specify semantic types of the input and output data it uses and its functionality. As large number of new services come online, it is impractical to require the user to come up with a semantic model of the service or rely on the service providers to conform to a standard. Instead, we would like to automatically learn the semantic model of a new service.

We describe a metadata-based classification method for recognizing input data types using only the terms extracted from a Web Service Definition file. We then verify the classifier's predictions by invoking the service with some sample data of that type. Once we discover correct classification, we invoke the service to produce output data samples. We then use content-based classifiers to recognize semantic types of the output data.

The agents need to ensure that the service providers they select are trustworthy. Because the agents are autonomous and there is no central trusted authority, the agents help each other determine the trustworthiness of the service providers they are interested in. This help is rendered via a series of referrals to other agents, culminating in zero or more trustworthy service providers being identified. A trust network is a multiagent system where each agent potentially rates the trustworthiness of another agent. This paper develops a formal treatment of trust networks. At the base is a recently proposed representation of trust via a probability certainty distribution. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of two operators, concatenation and aggregation, using which trust ratings can be combined in a trust network.

In the case of a deviation, AWDRAT conducts a diagnosis that figures out which computational resources are likely to have been compromised and then adds these assessments to its trust-model. The trust model in turn guides the recovery process, particularly by guiding the system in its choice among functionally equivalent methods and resources. AWDRAT has been used on an example application system, a graphical editor for constructing mission plans. We present data showing the effectiveness of AWDRAT in detecting a variety of compromises to the application system.|Howard E. Shrobe,Robert Laddaga,Robert Balzer,Neil M.

However, they are not able to handle large graphs, andor they do not allow interaction. We are interested on large graphs, with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Such graphs bring two challenges the first one is that any straightforward interactive manipulation will be prohibitively slow. The second one is sensory overload even if we could plot and replot the graph quickly, the user would be overwhelmed with the vast volume of information because the screen would be too cluttered as nodes and edges overlap each other.Our GMine system addresses both these issues, by using summarization and multi-resolution. GMine offers multi-resolution graph exploration by partitioning a given graph into a hierarchy of communities-within-communities and storing it into a novel R-treelike structure which we name G-Tree.

Previously, researchers have developed two types of supervised learning approaches for extracting web data methods that create precise, site-specific extraction rules and methods that learn less-precise site-independent extraction rules. In either case, significant training is required. AutoFeed follows a third, more ambitious approach, in which unsupervised learning is used to analyze sites and discover their structure. Our method relies on a set of heterogeneous \"experts\", each of which is capable of identifying certain types of generic structure. Each expert represents its discoveries as \"hints\". Based on these hints, our system clusters the pages and identifies semi-structured data that can be extracted. To identify a good clustering, we use a probabilistic model of the hint-generation process. This paper summarizes our formulation of the fully-automatic web-extraction problem, our clustering approach, and our results on a set of experiments.|Bora Gazen,Steven Minton","65909|AAAI|2006|Reinforcement Learning with Human Teachers Evidence of Feedback and Guidance with Implications for Learning Performance|As robots become a mass consumer product, they will need to learn new skills by interacting with typical human users.

We present findings from a human user study showing that people use the reward signal not only to provide feedback about past actions, but also to provide future directed rewards to guide subsequent actions.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

Compression techniques based on run-length encoding are used to improve the storage performance. However, these techniques introduce significant overheads in query processing even when only a few rows are queried. We propose a new bitmap encoding scheme based on multiple hashing, where the bitmap is kept in a compressed form, and can be directly accessed without decompression. Any subset of rows andor columns can be retrieved efficiently by reconstructing and processing only the necessary subset of the bitmap. The proposed scheme provides approximate results with a trade-off between the amount of space and the accuracy. False misses are guaranteed not to occur, and the false positive rate can be estimated and controlled. We show that query execution is significantly faster than WAH-compressed bitmaps, which have been previously shown to achieve the fastest query response times. The proposed scheme achieves accurate results (%-%) and improves the speed of query processing from  to  orders of magnitude compared to WAH.|Tan Apaydin,Guadalupe Canahuate,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu,Ali Saman Tosun","80604|VLDB|2006|Scalable Continuous Query Processing by Tracking Hotspots|This paper considers the problem of scalably processing a large number of continuous queries.

Our approach partitions the collection of continuous queries into groups based on the clustering patterns of the query ranges, and then applies specialized processing strategies to those heavily-clustered groups (or hotspots). To maintain the partition dynamically, we present efficient algorithms that maintain a nearly optimal partition in nearly amortized logarithmic time. We show how to use the hotspots to scalably process large numbers of continuous select-join and band-join queries, which are much more challenging than simple range selection queries. Experiments demonstrate that this approach can improve the processing throughput by orders of magnitude.

Holistic twig query processing techniques ,  have been developed to minimize the intermediate results, namely, those root-to-leaf path matches that are not in the final twig results. However, useless path matches cannot be completely avoided, especially when there is a parent-child relationship in the twig query. Furthermore, existing approaches do not consider the fact that in practice, in order to process XPath or XQuery statements, a more powerful form of twig queries, namely, Generalized-Tree-Pattern (GTP)  queries, is required. Most existing works on processing GTP queries generally calls for costly post-processing for eliminating redundant data andor grouping of the matching results.In this paper, we first propose a novel hierarchical stack encoding scheme to compactly represent the twig results. We introduce TwigStack, a bottom-up algorithm for processing twig queries based on this encoding scheme. Then we show how to efficiently enumerate the query results from the encodings for a given GTP query. To our knowledge, this is the first GTP matching solution that avoids any post path-join, sort, duplicate elimination and grouping operations. Extensive performance studies on various data sets and queries show that the proposed TwigStack algorithm not only has better twig query processing performance than state-of-the-art algorithms, but is also capable of efficiently processing the more complex GTP queries.|Songting Chen,Hua-Gang Li,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Wang-Pin Hsiung,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

Our main result is an algorithm for arranging a query's web service calls into a pipelined execution plan that optimally exploits parallelism among web services to minimize the query's total running time. Surprisingly, the optimal plan can be found in polynomial time even in the presence of arbitrary precedence constraints among web services, in contrast to traditional query optimization where the analogous problem is NP-hard. We also give an algorithm for determining the optimal granularity of data \"chunks\" to be used for each web service call.

To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a theoretical framework with a focus on an algebraic query model having a novel query semantics. Based on this semantics, XML fragments that look meaningful to a keyword-based query are effectively retrieved by the operations defined in the model. In contrast to earlier work, our model supports filters for restricting the size of a query result, which otherwise may contain a large number of potentially irrelevant fragments. We introduce a class of filters having a special property that enables significant reduction in query processing cost. Many practically useful filters fall in this class and hence, the proposed model can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents. Several other issues regarding algebraic manipulation of the operations defined in our query model are also formally discussed.|Sujeet Pradhan","80606|VLDB|2006|Query Co-Processing on Commodity Processors|The rapid increase in the data volumes for the past few decades has intensified the need for high processing power for database and data mining applications.

In most real-world problems, learning this value function requires a function approximator, which maps state-action pairs to values via a concise, parameterized function. In practice, the success of function approximators depends on the ability of the human designer to select an appropriate representation for the value function. A recently developed approach called evolutionary function approximation uses evolutionary computation to automate the search for effective representations. While this approach can substantially improve the performance of TD methods, it requires many sample episodes to do so. We present an enhancement to evolutionary function approximation that makes it much more sample-efficient by exploiting the off-policy nature of certain TD methods. Empirical results in a server job scheduling domain demonstrate that the enhanced method can learn better policies than evolution or TD methods alone and can do so in many fewer episodes than standard evolutionary function approximation.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone","65703|AAAI|2006|CUI Networks A Graphical Representation for Conditional Utility Independence|We introduce CUI networks, a compact graphical representation of utility functions over multiple attributes.

Probabilistic planners can reason over the missing information and produce plans that take into account the uncertainty about the environment. Unfortunately though, they can rarely scale up to the problems that are of interest in real-world. In this paper, however, we show that for a certain subset of problems we can develop a very efficient probabilistic planner. The proposed planner, called PPCP, is applicable to the problems for which it is clear what values of the missing information would result in the best plan. In other words, there exists a clear preference for the actual values of the missing information. For example, in the problem of robot navigation in partially-known environments it is always preferred to find out that an initially unknown location is traversable rather than not. The planner we propose exploits this property by using a series of deterministic A*-like searches to construct and refine a policy in anytime fashion. On the theoretical side, we show that once converged, the policy is guaranteed to be optimal under certain conditions. On the experimental side, we show the power of PPCP on the problem of robot navigation in partially-known terrains. The planner can scale up to very large environments with thousands of initially unknown locations. We believe that this is several orders of magnitude more unknowns than what the current probabilistic planners developed for the same problem can handle. Also, despite the fact that the problem we experimented on in general does not satisfy the conditions for the solution optimality, PPCP still produces the solutions that are nearly always optimal.|Maxim Likhachev,Anthony Stentz","65761|AAAI|2006|Learning Systems of Concepts with an Infinite Relational Model|Relationships between concepts account for a large proportion of semantic knowledge.

Among the methods proposed are Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE), Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) and Local Discriminant Embedding (LDE) which have been used in such applications as face recognition and imagevideo retrieval. However, although the data in these applications are more naturally represented as higher-order tensors, the embedding methods can only work with vectorized data representations which may not capture well some useful information in the original data. Moreover, high-dimensional vectorized representations also suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the high computational demand. In this paper, we propose some novel tensor embedding methods which, unlike previous methods, take data directly in the form of tensors of arbitrary order as input. These methods allow the relationships between dimensions of a tensor representation to be efficiently characterized. Moreover, they also allow the intrinsic local geometric and topological properties of the manifold embedded in a tensor space to be naturally estimated. Furthermore, they do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the high computational demand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tensor embedding methods on a face recognition application and compare them with some previous methods. Extensive experiments show that our methods are not only more effective but also more efficient.|Guang Dai,Dit-Yan Yeung","65813|AAAI|2006|Spinning Multiple Social Networks for Semantic Web|Social networks are important for the Semantic Web.

We empirically evaluate the performance of these algorithms within a generic model of a multi-sensor network performing wide area surveillance. These results show that the polynomial algorithm typically generated solutions much closer to the optimal than the theoretical bound, and prove the effectiveness of our pruning procedure.|Viet Dung Dang,Rajdeep K.

The semantic object hierarchy in WordNet grounds this ill-posed segmentation problem, so that true boundaries are defined as edges between instances of different classes, and all other edges are clutter. To avoid fully classifying each pixel, which is very difficult in generic images, we evaluate the semantic similarity of the two regions bounding each edge in an initial oversegmentation. Semantic similarity is computed using WordNet enhanced with appearance information, and is largely orthogonal to visual similarity. Hence two regions with very similar visual attributes, but from different categories, can have a large semantic distance and therefore evidence of a strong boundary between them, and vice versa. The ontology is trained with images from the UC Berkeley image segmentation benchmark, extended with manual labeling of the semantic content of each image segment. Results on boundary detection against the benchmark images show that semantic similarity computed through WordNet can significantly improve boundary detection compared to generic segmentation.|Anthony Hoogs,Roderic Collins","65756|AAAI|2006|Using Semantic Web Technologies for Policy Management on the Web|With policy management becoming popular as a means of providing flexible Web security, the number of policy languages being proposed for the Web is constantly increasing.

Previous work presented centralized methods for coordination failure diagnosis however, these are not always applicable, due to the significant computational and communication requirements, and the brittleness of a single point of failure. In this paper we propose a distributed approach to model-based coordination failure diagnosis. We model the coordination between the agents as a constraint graph, and adapt several algorithms from the distributed CSP area, to use as the basis for the diagnosis algorithms. We evaluate the algorithms in extensive experiments with simulated and real Sony Aibo robots and show that in general a trade-off exists between the computational requirements of the algorithms, and their diagnosis results. Surprisingly, in contrast to results in distributed CSPs, the asynchronous backtracking algorithm outperforms stochastic local search in terms of both quality and runtime.|Meir Kalech,Gal A.

One approach to monitoring such systems is to \"sniff\" these distributed logs and to store their transformed content in a DBMS. This centralizes the state and exposes it for querying unfortunately, it also creates uncertainty with respect to the recency and consistency of the data. Previous related work has focused on allowing queries to express currency and consistency constraints, which are then enforced by \"pulling\" data from the distributed sources on demand, or by requiring synchronous updates of a centralized data store. In some instances this is impossible due to legacy system issues or inefficient as the system scales to large numbers of processors. Accordingly, we propose that instead of enforcing consistency and recency, such monitoring systems should report these properties along with query results, with the hope that this will allow the data to be appropriately interpreted. We present techniques for reporting consistency and recency for queries and evaluate them with respect to efficiency and precision. Finally, we describe our prototype implementation and present experimental results of our techniques.|Jiansheng Huang,Jeffrey F.

We develop this idea for the evaluation of boolean XPath queries over a tree that is fragmented, both horizontally and vertically over a number of sites. The key idea is to send the whole query to each site which partially evaluates, in parallel, the query and sends the results as compact boolean functions to a coordinator which combines these to obtain the result. This approach has several advantages. First, each site is visited only once, even if several fragments of the tree are stored at that site. Second, no prior constraints on how the tree is decomposed are needed, nor is any structural information about the tree required, such as a DTD. Third, there is a satisfactory bound on the total computation performed on all sites and on the total network traffic. We also develop a simple incremental maintenance algorithm that requires communication only with the sites at which changes have taken place moreover the network traffic depends neither on the data nor on the update. These results, we believe, illustrate the usefulness and potential of partial evaluation in distributed systems as well as centralized xml stores for evaluating XPath queries and beyond.|Peter Buneman,Gao Cong,Wenfei Fan,Anastasios Kementsietsidis","80698|VLDB|2006|Next Generation Data Management in Enterprise Application Platforms|As a leading provider of applications and application infrastructure software, SAP has been always interested in the entire spectrum of enterprise data management from transactional to analytical, structured and unstructured, as well as high-volatility event data streams. The underlying architecture for enterprise applications has fundamentally changed in the last decade, with the adoption of service-oriented architectures representing the latest shift. However, DBMS architecture has not evolved sufficiently to meet the challenges that these new application characteristics pose. As a result, at SAP we have been rethinking the way enterprise applications manage their data. In this talk, we will present some key aspects of this rethinking. We will start with a description of the shift in application architecture and the challenges that this shift poses on data management. We will then describe the failings of a single overarching DBMS architecture against these needs, and then describe some examples of usage-specific data management in enterprise application platforms. In particular we will focus on our approach to managing analytical, transactional and master data. We will present some results that describe how, with a combination of better utilization of main-memory based data management techniques, addressing the needs of the next generation application infrastructure and advances in the underlying computing and storage infrastructure, we can do significantly more efficient data management.|Vishal Sikka","80671|VLDB|2006|An Integrated Approach to Recovery and High Availability in an Updatable Distributed Data Warehouse|Any highly available data warehouse will use some form of data replication to tolerate machine failures. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can leverage this data redundancy to build an integrated approach to recovery and high availability. Our approach, called HARBOR, revives a crashed site by querying remote, online sites for missing updates and uses timestamps to determine which tuples need to be copied or updated. HARBOR does not require a stable log, recovers without quiescing the system, allows replicated data to be stored non-identically, and is simpler than a log-based recovery algorithm.We compare the runtime overhead and recovery performance of HARBOR to those of two-phase commit and ARIES, the gold standard for log-based recovery, on a three-node distributed database system. Our experiments demonstrate that HARBOR suffers lower runtime overhead, has recovery performance comparable to ARIES's, and can tolerate the fault of a worker and efficiently bring it back online.|Edmond Lau,Samuel Madden","65736|AAAI|2006|A New Approach to Distributed Task Assignment using Lagrangian Decomposition and Distributed Constraint Satisfaction|We present a new formulation of distributed task assignment, called Generalized Mutual Assignment Problem (GMAP), which is derived from an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that has been studied for many years in the operations research community. To solve the GMAP, we introduce a novel distributed solution protocol using Lagrangian decomposition and distributed constraint satisfaction, where the agents solve their individual optimization problems and coordinate their locally optimized solutions through a distributed constraint satisfaction technique. Next, to produce quick agreement between the agents on a feasible solution with reasonably good quality, we provide a parameter that controls the range of \"noise\" mixed with an incrementdecrement in a Lagrange multiplier. Our experimental results indicate that the parameter may allow us to control tradeoffs between the quality of a solution and the cost of finding it.|Katsutoshi Hirayama","65723|AAAI|2006|Embedding Heterogeneous Data Using Statistical Models|Embedding algorithms are a method for revealing low dimensional structure in complex data.

The joint distributions of the heterogenous objects are modeled as exponentials of squared Euclidean distances in a low-dimensional embedding space. This construction links the problem to convex optimization over positive semidefinite matrices. We quantify the performance of our method on two text datasets, and show that it consistently and significantly outperforms standard methods of statistical correspondence modeling, such as multidimensional scaling and correspondence analysis.|Amir Globerson,Gal Chechik,Fernando Pereira,Naftali Tishby","80705|VLDB|2006|Online Outlier Detection in Sensor Data Using Non-Parametric Models|Sensor networks have recently found many popular applications in a number of different settings.

Previous investigations of overhearing assumed that all inter-agent communications are accessible to a single overhearing agent. However, as multi-agent systems grow both in size and distribution two problems arise. First, in large-scale settings, an overhearing agent cannot monitor all agents and their conversations, and must therefore be selective in carefully choosing its targets. Second, a single overhearer would encounter difficulties overhearing agents acting in a geographically-distributed environment. This paper tackles these challenges by addressing distributed teams of overhearing agents involved in selective overhearing. Building on prior work on centralized selective overhearing, we consider the consequences of transitioning from overhearing teams working in a centrally-coordinated manner to distributed overhearing teams. In doing so, we distinguish the various factors influencing the level of distribution within these teams and determine their importance in terms of effective selective overhearing.|Gery Gutnik,Gal A.

For example, consider the problem of multirobot surveillance (Ahmadi & Stone ), in which a team of robots must collaboratively patrol a given area. If any two robots can directly communicate at all times, the robots can coordinate for efficient behavior. This condition holds trivially in environments that are smaller than the robots' communication range. However in larger environments, the robots must actively maintain physical locations such that any two robots can communicate -- possibly through a series of other robots. Otherwise, the robots may lose track of each others' activities and become miscoordinated. Furthermore, since robots are relatively unreliable andor may need to change tasks (for example if a robot is suddenly called by a human user to perform some other task), in a stable multirobot surveillance system, if one of the robots leaves or crashes, the rest should still be able to communicate. Some examples of other tasks that could benefit from any pair of robots being able to communicate with each other, are multi-robot exploration, search and rescue, and cleaning robots. We say that robot R is connected to robot R if there is a series of robots, each within communication range of the previous, which can pass a message from R to R. It is not possible to maintain connectivity in the face of arbitrary numbers of robot departures if there are any two robots that are not within communication of one another and all other robots simultaneously depart, the system becomes disconnected. Thus we focus on the property of remaining robust to any single failure under the assumption that the team can readjust its positioning in response to a departure more quickly than a second departure will occur. In order for the team to stay connected, even in the face of any single departure, it must be the case that every robot is connected to each other robot either directly or via two distinct paths that do not share any robots in common. We call this property biconnectivity the removal of any one robot from the system does not disconnect the remaining robots from each other.|Mazda Ahmadi,Peter Stone","65895|AAAI|2006|Real-Time Evolution of Neural Networks in the NERO Video Game|A major goal for AI is to allow users to interact with agents that learn in real time, making new kinds of interactive simulations, training applications, and digital entertainment possible.

This definition is motivated by the observation that in many strategic situations such as parlor games, competitive economic scenarios, and some social choice settings, players are merely interested in performing optimal relative to their opponents rather than in absolute measures. A simple but important subclass of ranking games are single-winner games where in any outcome one agent wins and all others lose. We investigate the computational complexity of a variety of common game-theoretic solution concepts in ranking games and deliver hardness results for iterated weak dominance and mixed Nash equilibria when there are more than two players and pure Nash equilibria when the number of players is unbounded.

Probabilistic planners can reason over the missing information and produce plans that take into account the uncertainty about the environment. Unfortunately though, they can rarely scale up to the problems that are of interest in real-world. In this paper, however, we show that for a certain subset of problems we can develop a very efficient probabilistic planner. The proposed planner, called PPCP, is applicable to the problems for which it is clear what values of the missing information would result in the best plan. In other words, there exists a clear preference for the actual values of the missing information. For example, in the problem of robot navigation in partially-known environments it is always preferred to find out that an initially unknown location is traversable rather than not. The planner we propose exploits this property by using a series of deterministic A*-like searches to construct and refine a policy in anytime fashion. On the theoretical side, we show that once converged, the policy is guaranteed to be optimal under certain conditions. On the experimental side, we show the power of PPCP on the problem of robot navigation in partially-known terrains. The planner can scale up to very large environments with thousands of initially unknown locations. We believe that this is several orders of magnitude more unknowns than what the current probabilistic planners developed for the same problem can handle.

Simple models make it difficult to accurately model a user's information need. The model presented in the paper is based on Markov random fields and allows almost arbitrary features to be encoded. This provides a powerful mechanism for modeling many of the implicit constraints a user has in mind when formulating a query. Simple instantiations of the model that consider dependencies between the terms in a query have shown to significantly outperform bag of words models. Further extensions of the model are possible to incorporate even more complex constraints based other domain knowledge. Finally, we describe what place our model has within the broader realm of artificial intelligence and propose several open questions that may be of general interest to the field.|Donald Metzler,W.

However, combining conditional planning with goal preferences adds some new difficulties to the problem. Indeed, even the notion of optimal plan is far from trivial, since plans in nondeterministic domains can result in several different behaviors satisfying conditions with different preferences. Planning for optimal conditional plans must therefore take into account the different behaviors, and conditionally search for the highest preference that can be achieved. In this paper, we address this problem. We formalize the notion of optimal conditional plan, and we describe a correct and complete planning algorithm that is guaranteed to find optimal solutions. We implement the algorithm using BDD-based techniques, and show the practical potentialities of our approach through a preliminary experimental evaluation.|Dmitry Shaparau,Marco Pistore,Paolo Traverso"],["80710|VLDB|2006|Efficient Secure Query Evaluation over Encrypted XML Databases|Motivated by the \"database-as-service\" paradigm wherein data owned by a client is hosted on a third-party server, there is significant interest in secure query evaluation over encrypted databases. We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

Compression techniques based on run-length encoding are used to improve the storage performance. However, these techniques introduce significant overheads in query processing even when only a few rows are queried. We propose a new bitmap encoding scheme based on multiple hashing, where the bitmap is kept in a compressed form, and can be directly accessed without decompression. Any subset of rows andor columns can be retrieved efficiently by reconstructing and processing only the necessary subset of the bitmap. The proposed scheme provides approximate results with a trade-off between the amount of space and the accuracy. False misses are guaranteed not to occur, and the false positive rate can be estimated and controlled. We show that query execution is significantly faster than WAH-compressed bitmaps, which have been previously shown to achieve the fastest query response times. The proposed scheme achieves accurate results (%-%) and improves the speed of query processing from  to  orders of magnitude compared to WAH.|Tan Apaydin,Guadalupe Canahuate,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu,Ali Saman Tosun","80629|VLDB|2006|TwigStack Bottom-up Processing of Generalized-Tree-Pattern Queries over XML Documents|Tree pattern matching is one of the most fundamental tasks for XML query processing. Holistic twig query processing techniques ,  have been developed to minimize the intermediate results, namely, those root-to-leaf path matches that are not in the final twig results. However, useless path matches cannot be completely avoided, especially when there is a parent-child relationship in the twig query. Furthermore, existing approaches do not consider the fact that in practice, in order to process XPath or XQuery statements, a more powerful form of twig queries, namely, Generalized-Tree-Pattern (GTP)  queries, is required. Most existing works on processing GTP queries generally calls for costly post-processing for eliminating redundant data andor grouping of the matching results.In this paper, we first propose a novel hierarchical stack encoding scheme to compactly represent the twig results. We introduce TwigStack, a bottom-up algorithm for processing twig queries based on this encoding scheme. Then we show how to efficiently enumerate the query results from the encodings for a given GTP query. To our knowledge, this is the first GTP matching solution that avoids any post path-join, sort, duplicate elimination and grouping operations. Extensive performance studies on various data sets and queries show that the proposed TwigStack algorithm not only has better twig query processing performance than state-of-the-art algorithms, but is also capable of efficiently processing the more complex GTP queries.|Songting Chen,Hua-Gang Li,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Wang-Pin Hsiung,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

This paper tackles a first basic WSMS problem query optimization for Select-Project-Join queries spanning multiple web services. Our main result is an algorithm for arranging a query's web service calls into a pipelined execution plan that optimally exploits parallelism among web services to minimize the query's total running time. Surprisingly, the optimal plan can be found in polynomial time even in the presence of arbitrary precedence constraints among web services, in contrast to traditional query optimization where the analogous problem is NP-hard. We also give an algorithm for determining the optimal granularity of data \"chunks\" to be used for each web service call.

To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a theoretical framework with a focus on an algebraic query model having a novel query semantics. Based on this semantics, XML fragments that look meaningful to a keyword-based query are effectively retrieved by the operations defined in the model. In contrast to earlier work, our model supports filters for restricting the size of a query result, which otherwise may contain a large number of potentially irrelevant fragments. We introduce a class of filters having a special property that enables significant reduction in query processing cost. Many practically useful filters fall in this class and hence, the proposed model can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents. Several other issues regarding algebraic manipulation of the operations defined in our query model are also formally discussed.|Sujeet Pradhan","80701|VLDB|2006|AQAX A System for Approximate XML Query Answers|On-line, interactive exploration of large databases becomes prohibitively expensive as the size of the database grows.

We have developed an on-line XML exploration system, termed AQAX that relies on accurate XML summaries in order to enable the rapid exploration of large data sets. To effectively support the exploration of semi-structured query answers, our system employs a tight coupling between the main query processor and the graphical clients that visualize the results.

Column values are encoded into variable length codes to exploit skew in their frequencies. The codes in each tuple are concatenated and the resulting tuplecodes are sorted and delta-coded to exploit the lack of ordering in a relation. Correlation is exploited either by co-coding correlated columns, or by using a sort order that leverages the correlation. We prove that this method leads to near-optimal compression (within . bitstuple of entropy), and in practice, we obtain up to a  fold compression ratio on vertical partitions tuned for TPC-H queries.We also describe initial investigations into efficient querying over compressed data. We present a novel Huffman coding scheme, called segregated coding, that allows range and equality predicates on compressed data, without accessing the full dictionary. We also exploit the delta coding to speed up scans, by reusing computations performed on nearly identical records. Initial results from a prototype suggest that with these optimizations, we can efficiently scan, tokenize and apply predicates on compressed relations.|Vijayshankar Raman,Garret Swart","65702|AAAI|2006|DNNF-based Belief State Estimation|As embedded systems grow increasingly complex, there is a pressing need for diagnosing and monitoring capabilities that estimate the system state robustly.

Among the methods proposed are Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE), Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) and Local Discriminant Embedding (LDE) which have been used in such applications as face recognition and imagevideo retrieval. However, although the data in these applications are more naturally represented as higher-order tensors, the embedding methods can only work with vectorized data representations which may not capture well some useful information in the original data. Moreover, high-dimensional vectorized representations also suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the high computational demand. In this paper, we propose some novel tensor embedding methods which, unlike previous methods, take data directly in the form of tensors of arbitrary order as input. These methods allow the relationships between dimensions of a tensor representation to be efficiently characterized. Moreover, they also allow the intrinsic local geometric and topological properties of the manifold embedded in a tensor space to be naturally estimated. Furthermore, they do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the high computational demand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tensor embedding methods on a face recognition application and compare them with some previous methods.

In most real-world problems, learning this value function requires a function approximator, which maps state-action pairs to values via a concise, parameterized function. In practice, the success of function approximators depends on the ability of the human designer to select an appropriate representation for the value function. A recently developed approach called evolutionary function approximation uses evolutionary computation to automate the search for effective representations. While this approach can substantially improve the performance of TD methods, it requires many sample episodes to do so. We present an enhancement to evolutionary function approximation that makes it much more sample-efficient by exploiting the off-policy nature of certain TD methods. Empirical results in a server job scheduling domain demonstrate that the enhanced method can learn better policies than evolution or TD methods alone and can do so in many fewer episodes than standard evolutionary function approximation.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone","65901|AAAI|2006|Integrating Joint Intention Theory Belief Reasoning and Communicative Action for Generating Team-Oriented Dialogue|The goal of this research is to develop an architecture that can guide an agent during collaborative teamwork.

As an interpreter of joint actions, the architecture enables agent programmers to describe a domain declaratively, specifying an agent's individual and joint intentions, plans and actions at a high level. The interpreter attempts to fulfill the agent's individual and joint intentions, subject to its beliefs and mutual beliefs.

Empirically, we provide experimental results showing that the quality of approximations can be improved without incurring much additional computational cost.
