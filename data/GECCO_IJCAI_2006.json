Besides classification and reinforcement learning tasks, XCS was applied as an effective function approximator. Hereby, XCS learns space partitions to enable a maximally accurate and general function approximation. Recently, the function approximation approach was improved by replacing () hyperrectangular conditions with hyper-ellipsoids and () iterative linear approximation with the recursive least squares method. This paper combines the two approaches assessing the usefulness of each. The evolutionary process is further improved by changing the mutation operator implementing an angular mutation that rotates ellipsoidal structures explicitly. Both enhancements improve XCS performance in various non-linear functions. We also analyze the evolving ellipsoidal structures confirming that XCS stretches and rotates the evolving ellipsoids according to the shape of the underlying function. The results confirm that improvements in both the evolutionary approach and the gradient approach can result in significantly better performance.|Martin V. Butz,Pier Luca Lanzi,Stewart W.

We show that XCS with standard parameter settings is quite robust to considerable class imbalances. For high class imbalances, XCS suffers from biases toward the majority class. We analyze XCS's behavior under such extreme imbalances and prove that appropriate parameter tuning improves significantly XCS's performance. Specifically, we counterbalance the imbalance ratio by equalizing the reproduction probabilities of the most occurring and least occurring niches. The study provides guidelines to tune XCS's parameters for unbalanced datasets, based on the dataset imbalance ratio. We propose a method to estimate the imbalance ratio during XCS's training and adapt XCS's parameters online.|Albert Orriols-Puig,Ester Bernadó-Mansilla","57712|GECCO|2006|Standard and averaging reinforcement learning in XCS|This paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) in XCS. First, it formally shows that XCS implements a method of generalized RL based on linear approximators, in which the usual input mapping function translates the state-action space into a niche relative fitness space. Then, it shows that, although XCS has always been related to standard RL, XCS is actually a method of averaging RL. More precisely, XCS with gradient descent can be actually derived from the typical update of averaging RL. It is noted that the use of averaging RL in XCS introduces an intrinsic preference toward classifiers with a smaller fitness in the niche. It is argued that, because of the accuracy pressure in XCS, this results in an additional preference toward specificity. A very simple experiment is presented to support this hypothesis. The same approach is applied to XCS with computed prediction (XCSF) and similar conclusions are drawn.|Pier Luca Lanzi,Daniele Loiacono","57594|GECCO|2006|Smart crossover operator with multiple parents for a Pittsburgh learning classifier system|This paper proposes a new smart crossover operator for a Pittsburgh Learning Classifier System. This operator, unlike other recent LCS approaches of smart recombination, does not learn the structure of the domain, but it merges the rules of N parents (N  ) to generate a new offspring. This merge process uses an heuristic that selects the minimum subset of candidate rules that obtains maximum training accuracy. Moreover the operator also includes a rule pruning scheme to avoid the inclusion of over-specific rules, and to guarantee as much as possible the robust behaviour of the LCS. This operator takes advantage from the fact that each individual in a Pittsburgh LCS is a complete solution, and the system has a global view of the solution space that the proposed rule selection algorithm exploits. We have empirically evaluated this operator using a recent LCS called GAssist. First with the standard LCS benchmark, the  bits multiplexer, and later using  standard real datasets. The results of the experiments over these datasets indicate that the new operator manages to increase the accuracy of the system over the classical crossover in  of the  datasets, and never having a significantly worse performance than the classic operator.|Jaume Bacardit,Natalio Krasnogor","57733|GECCO|2006|Fast rule matching for learning classifier systems via vector instructions|Over the last ten years XCS has become the standard for Michigan-style learning classifier systems (LCS). Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time. The proposed fast matching scheme also fits in any other LCS other than XCS.|Xavier Llorà,Kumara Sastry","57616|GECCO|2006|Studying XCSBOA learning in Boolean functions structure encoding and random Boolean functions|Recently, studies with the XCS classifier system on Boolean functions have shown that in certain types of functions simple crossover operators can lead to disruption and, consequently, a more effective recombination mechanism is required. Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used -bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A -bit coding scheme as well as a restricted -bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multi-step problems, and function approximation problems.|Martin V.

We have already proposed a bucket brigade algorithm (a reinforcement learning method for classifiers) and a procedure for choosing what to learn depending on the frequency of events with the aim of facilitating real-time learning while a game is in progress. We have also proposed a hybrid system configuration that combines existing algorithm strategies with a classifier system, and we have reported on the effectiveness of this hybrid system. In this paper, we report on the results of performing reinforcement learning with different reward values assigned to reflect differences in the roles performed by forward, midfielder and defense players, and we describe the results obtained when learning is performed with different combinations of success rewards for various type of play such as dribbling and passing. In  matches played against an existing soccer game incorporating an algorithm devised by humans, a better win ratio and better convergence were observed compared with the case where learning was performed with no roles assigned to all of the in-game agents.|Yuji Sato,Yosuke Akatsuka,Takenori Nishizono","57748|GECCO|2006|A representational ecology for learning classifier systems|The representation used by a learning algorithm introduces a bias which is more or less well-suited to any given learning problem. It is well known that, across all possible problems, one algorithm is no better than any other. Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies. The result is an ecology in which the representations are species.|James A. R.

Previous techniques calculate the mean effective objective (for robust) by using samples without much evenly distributing over the neighborhood. The samples by using orthogonal array distribute evenly. Therefore the calculation of mean effective objective more robust. The new technique is generalized from the ODEA algorithm . An orthogonal design method is employed on the niches for the mutation operator to find a potentially good solution that may become the representative in the niche. The fitness of the offspring is therefore likely to be higher than that of its parent. We propose a complex benchmark, consisting of moving function peaks, to test our new approach. Numerical experiments show that the moving solutions of the algorithm are a little worse in objective value but robust.|Sanyou Y. Zeng,Rui Wang,Hui Shi,Guang Chen,Hugo de Garis,Lishan Kang,Lixin X.

To achieve convergence, most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms today employ Pareto-ranking as the main criteria for fitness calculation. The computation of Pareto-rank in a population is time consuming, and arguably the most computationally expensive component in an iteration of the said algorithms. This paper proposes a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm which avoids Pareto-ranking altogether by employing the transitivity of the domination relation. The proposed algorithm is an elitist algorithm with explicit diversity preservation procedure. It applies a measure reflecting the degree of domination between solutions in a steady-state replacement strategy to determine which individuals survive to the next iteration. Results on nine standard test functions demonstrated that the algorithm performs favorably compared to the popular NSGA-II in terms of convergence as well as diversity of the Pareto-set approximation, and is computationally more efficient.|Dipti Srinivasan,Lily Rachmawati","57652|GECCO|2006|D airspace sectoring by evolutionary computation real-world applications|This paper presents a new method for D cutting of geometrical space with application to airspace sectoring.

The algorithm facilitates better decision making in contexts where high marginal rates of return are desirable for Decision Makers. The proposed approach computes a transformation of the original objectives based on weighted-sum functions. The transformed functions identify niches which correspond to knee regions in the objective space.

The proposed approach is illustrated with an example from genomics (in particular, Alzheimer's disease) by constructing virtual reality spaces resulting from multi-objective optimization. Selected solutions along the Pareto front approximation are used as nonlinearly transformed features for new spaces that compromise similarity structure preservation (from an unsupervised perspective) and class separability (from a supervised pattern recognition perspective), simultaneously. The possibility of spanning a range of solutions between these two important goals, is a benefit for the knowledge discovery and data understanding process. The quality of the set of discovered solutions is superior to the ones obtained separately, from the point ofview of visual data mining.|Julio J. Valdés,Alan J.

Such problems can be solved efficiently only through simultaneous improvements to each decision variable. Evaluation of EMO algorithms with respect to this class of problem has relevance to real-world problems, which are seldom separable. However, many EMO test problems do not have this characteristic. The proposed set of test problems in this paper is intended to address this important requirement. The design principles of these test problems and a description of each new test problem are presented. Experimental results on these problems using a Differential Evolution Multi-objective Optimization algorithm are presented and contrasted with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II).|Antony W.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa","57843|GECCO|2006|Multiobjective evolutionary optimization for visual data mining with virtual reality spaces application to Alzheimer gene expressions|This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization approach to the problem of computing virtual reality spaces for the visual representation of relational structures (e.g. databases), symbolic knowledge and others, in the context of visual data mining and knowledge discovery. Procedures based on evolutionary computation are discussed. In particular, the NSGA-II algorithm is used as a framework for an instance of this methodology simultaneously minimizing Sammon's error for dissimilarity measures, and mean cross-validation error on a k-nn pattern classifier. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example from genomics (in particular, Alzheimer's disease) by constructing virtual reality spaces resulting from multi-objective optimization. Selected solutions along the Pareto front approximation are used as nonlinearly transformed features for new spaces that compromise similarity structure preservation (from an unsupervised perspective) and class separability (from a supervised pattern recognition perspective), simultaneously. The possibility of spanning a range of solutions between these two important goals, is a benefit for the knowledge discovery and data understanding process. The quality of the set of discovered solutions is superior to the ones obtained separately, from the point ofview of visual data mining.|Julio J. Valdés,Alan J.

The agent perceives the environment from a video camera and conveys its actions to the car via standard radio control transmitter. In order to cope with the video feed latency we propose an anticipatory modeling in which the agent considers its current actions based on the anticipated intrinsic (rather than currently available, outdated) state of the car and its surrounding. The agent is first evolved on software models of the car and tracks, and then adapted to the real world. During the adaptation, the lap times improve steadily to the values close to the values obtained from the evolution on the models. An evolutionary optimization of the avoidance of a small obstacle results in lap times that are virtually the same as the best lap times achieved on the same track without obstacles.

When the GA is initialized with a population close to the fitness peak, the GA will be able to stay close to the fitness peak. Roughly speaking, the parameter settings involve strong recombination, weak selection, and require mutation. This \"bistability\" phenomenon has been previously investigated with needle-in-the-haystack fitness functions, but this fitness, when used with a GA with random initialization, requires a population size exponential in the string length for the GA to have nontrivial behavior. We introduce sloping-plateau fitness functions which show the bistability phenomenon and should scale to arbitrary string lengths. We introduce and use an unitation infinite population model to investigate the bistability phenomenon. For the fitnesses and GAs considered in the paper, we show that the use of crossover moves the GA to its fixed point faster in comparison to the same GA without crossover.|Alden H. Wright,J.

Our approach uses fully decentralized operators for reproduction like mutation, recombination and selection, regulated by market mechanisms. The novelty of this approach lies in the decentralized bottom-up adaption method for decentralized systems and we use a logistic scenario as an example. Our proposed method is based on a formal model explaining how adaption occurs in the number and strategies of agents and thus of logistic networks. The implementation and experimental results are given to illustrate the expected outcomes.|Stephan Otto,Stefan Kirn","57685|GECCO|2006|A new proposal for multi-objective optimization using differential evolution and rough sets theory|This paper presents a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on differential evolution and rough sets theory. The proposed approach adopts an external archive in order to retain the nondominated solutions found during the evolutionary process. Additionally, the approach also incorporates the concept of pa-dominance to get a good distribution of the solutions retained. The main idea of the approach is to use differential evolution (DE) as our main search engine, trying to translate its good convergence properties exhibited in single-objective optimization to the multi-objective case. Rough sets theory is adopted in a second stage of the search in order to improve the spread of the nondominated solutions that have been found so far. Our hybrid approach is validated using standard test functions and metrics commonly adopted in the specialized literature. Our results are compared with respect to the NSGA-II, which is a MOEA representative of the state-of-the-art in the area.|Alfredo García Hernández-Díaz,Luis V. Santana-Quintero,Carlos A.

The genetic programming systems use common mutation and crossover operators as well as fitness-proportional selection. In addition, the mutation and crossover rates are annealed to zero in predefined fashion over the course of the algorithm, and power-law scaling is used for the (possibly population-dependent) initial fitness function with (unbounded) logarithmic growth in the exponent.We assume that a set of globally optimal creatures for the optimization problem instance exists. In addition, it is assumed that the ratio of the best fitness of globally optimal creatures vs the fitness of other creatures is greater or equal a constant  in any population they jointly reside in. We discuss how both conditions can usually be satisfied in application settings. Under the above conditions, a selected, traceable sequence of probability distributions over the possible states of the properly scaled genetic programming system converge in time towards the convex set of probability distributions over uniform populations that contain only globally optimal creatures.|Lothar M.

Genetically robust solutions are solutions that are less likely to be degraded by genetic operators, such as crossover. Previous work has shown that there is significant evolutionary pressure in favor of genetically robust solutions and that evolving programs adopt a number of strategies to increase genetic robustness, notably an increase in inoperative 'genes' (individual genetic units that don't influence fitness) and a preference for 'genes' with a relatively small effect on fitness.Here we examine the role of genes that cancel each other out. We find that allowing such 'canceling genes' leads to an overall increase in the rate of code growth, both through the inclusion of self-canceling code and through a general increase in introns. Finally, we find that the evolution generally follows a two-step process. Initially the operative code evolves rapidly to achieve a (near) optimal fitness. Then, the inoperative code begins to evolve most rapidly to increase robustness. In an extreme case of a problem that can be solved with no operative genes, individuals evolve by losing all operative genes and then losing all inoperative genes.|Xue Zhong,Terence Soule","57706|GECCO|2006|On the local performance of simulated annealing and the  evolutionary algorithm|Simulated annealing and the (+) EA, a simple evolutionary algorithm, are both general randomized search heuristics that optimize any objective function with probability converging to . But they use very different techniques to achieve this global convergence. The (+) EA applies global mutations than can reach any point in the search space in one step together with an elitist selection mechanism. Simulated annealing restricts its search to a neighborhood but employs a randomized selection scheme where the probability for accepting a move to a new point in the search space depends on the difference in function values as well as on the current time step. Otherwise, the two algorithms are equal. It is known that the different philosophies of search implemented in the two heuristics can lead to exponential performance gaps between the two algorithms with respect to the expected optimization time. Even for very restricted classes of objective functions where the differences in function values between neighboring points are strictly limited the performance differences can be huge. Here, a more local point of view is taken. Considering obstacles in the fitness landscapes it is proven that the local performance of the two algorithms is remarkably similar in spite of their different search behaviors.|Thomas Jansen,Ingo Wegener","57802|GECCO|2006|Evaluation relaxation using substructural information and linear estimation|The paper presents an evaluation-relaxation scheme where a fitness surrogate automatically adapts to the problem structure and the partial contributions of subsolutions to the fitness of an individual are estimated efficiently and accurately.

Using the surrogate avoids the need for expensive fitness evaluation for some of the solutions, and thereby yields significant efficiency enhancement. Results show that a surrogate, which automatically adapts to problem knowledge mined from probabilistic models, yields substantial speedup (.--.) on a class of boundedly-difficult additively-decomposable problems with and without additive Gaussian noise.

In order to study the interplay between neutrality, which exists in many real-world applications, and performances of metaheuristics, it is useful to design landscapes which make it possible to tune precisely neutral degree distribution. Even though many neutral landscape models have already been designed, none of them are general enough to create landscapes with specific neutral degree distributions. We propose three steps to design such landscapes first using an algorithm we construct a landscape whose distribution roughly fits the target one, then we use a simulated annealing heuristic to bring closer the two distributions and finally we affect fitness values to each neutral network.

To achieve convergence, most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms today employ Pareto-ranking as the main criteria for fitness calculation. The computation of Pareto-rank in a population is time consuming, and arguably the most computationally expensive component in an iteration of the said algorithms. This paper proposes a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm which avoids Pareto-ranking altogether by employing the transitivity of the domination relation. The proposed algorithm is an elitist algorithm with explicit diversity preservation procedure. It applies a measure reflecting the degree of domination between solutions in a steady-state replacement strategy to determine which individuals survive to the next iteration. Results on nine standard test functions demonstrated that the algorithm performs favorably compared to the popular NSGA-II in terms of convergence as well as diversity of the Pareto-set approximation, and is computationally more efficient.|Dipti Srinivasan,Lily Rachmawati","57815|GECCO|2006|Single and multi-objective genetic operators in object-oriented conceptual software design|This poster paper investigates the potential of single and multi-objective genetic operators with an object-oriented conceptual design space.

The genetic programming systems use common mutation and crossover operators as well as fitness-proportional selection. In addition, the mutation and crossover rates are annealed to zero in predefined fashion over the course of the algorithm, and power-law scaling is used for the (possibly population-dependent) initial fitness function with (unbounded) logarithmic growth in the exponent.We assume that a set of globally optimal creatures for the optimization problem instance exists. In addition, it is assumed that the ratio of the best fitness of globally optimal creatures vs the fitness of other creatures is greater or equal a constant  in any population they jointly reside in. We discuss how both conditions can usually be satisfied in application settings. Under the above conditions, a selected, traceable sequence of probability distributions over the possible states of the properly scaled genetic programming system converge in time towards the convex set of probability distributions over uniform populations that contain only globally optimal creatures.|Lothar M.

It is well known that, across all possible problems, one algorithm is no better than any other. Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies.

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems. Initial results indicate that the approach improves algorithm performance, especially in problems where the frequency of objective change is high.|Iason Hatzakis,David Wallace","57670|GECCO|2006|On the effect of populations in evolutionary multi-objective optimization|Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become increasingly popular as multi-objective problem solving techniques.

The ability of the algorithms in finding, locating, and maintaining multiple optima is judged using two performance measures (i) number of peaks maintained, and (ii) computational time.

Although promising results have already been obtained when combined with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), an important question remains what is the best way to integrate the use of gradient techniques in the evolutionary cycle of a MOEA. In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA. During optimization, the effectivity of the gradient techniques is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective operator to spend the most resources. In addition, we indicate how the multi-objective search can be stimulated to also search $mboxemphalong $ the Pareto front, ultimately resulting in a better and wider spread of solutions. We perform tests on a few well-known benchmark problems as well as two novel benchmark problems with specific gradient properties. We compare the results of our adaptive resource-allocation scheme with the same MOEA without the use of gradient techniques and a scheme in which resource allocation is constant. The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

Roughly speaking, the parameter settings involve strong recombination, weak selection, and require mutation.

Unfortunately, under certain realistic conditions, not all bit combinations will represent valid solutions. This means that in many instances, useful solutions are sparse in the search space. We implement a new crossover operator that preserves valid solutions under this representation. Our results show that this reproductive strategy is more efficient, effective, and robust than previous work.

They are simple, easy to understand and inspire confidence. Many of these HAs are good for some problem instances while very poor for other cases. While Meta-Heuristics try to find which is the best heuristic andor parameters to apply for a given problem instance Hyper-Heuristics (HH) try to combine several heuristics in the same solution searching process, switching among them whenever the circumstances vary. Besides, instead to solve a single problem instance it tries to find a general algorithm to apply to whole families of problems. HH use evolutionary methods to search for such a problem-solving algorithm and, once produced, to apply it to any new problem instance desired. Learning Classifier Systems (LCS), and in particular XCS, represents an elegant and simple way to try to fabricate such a composite algorithm. This represents a different kind of problem to those already studied by the LCS community. Previous work, using single step environments, already showed the usefulness of the approach. This paper goes further and studies the novel use of multi-step environments for HH and an alternate way to consider states to see if chains of actions can be learnt. A non-trivial, NP-hard family of problems, the Bin Packing one, is used as benchmark for the procedure. Results of the approach are very encouraging, showing outperformance over all HAs used individually and over previously reported work by the authors, including non-LCS (a GA based approach used for the same BP set of problems) and LCS (using single step environments).|Javier G.

This operator, unlike other recent LCS approaches of smart recombination, does not learn the structure of the domain, but it merges the rules of N parents (N  ) to generate a new offspring. This merge process uses an heuristic that selects the minimum subset of candidate rules that obtains maximum training accuracy. Moreover the operator also includes a rule pruning scheme to avoid the inclusion of over-specific rules, and to guarantee as much as possible the robust behaviour of the LCS. This operator takes advantage from the fact that each individual in a Pittsburgh LCS is a complete solution, and the system has a global view of the solution space that the proposed rule selection algorithm exploits. We have empirically evaluated this operator using a recent LCS called GAssist. First with the standard LCS benchmark, the  bits multiplexer, and later using  standard real datasets. The results of the experiments over these datasets indicate that the new operator manages to increase the accuracy of the system over the classical crossover in  of the  datasets, and never having a significantly worse performance than the classic operator.|Jaume Bacardit,Natalio Krasnogor","57713|GECCO|2006|Classifier prediction based on tile coding|This paper introduces XCSF extended with tile coding prediction each classifier implements a tile coding approximator the genetic algorithm is used to adapt both classifier conditions (i.e., to partition the problem) and the parameters of each approximator thus XCSF evolves an ensemble of tile coding approximators instead of the typical monolithic approximator used in reinforcement learning.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time.

Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres.

Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used -bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A -bit coding scheme as well as a restricted -bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multi-step problems, and function approximation problems.|Martin V.

Typically, timing constraints must be satisfied so that real-time embedded systems work properly and safely. Execution time testing involves finding the best and worst case execution times to determine if timing constraints are respected. Evolutionary real-time testing (ERTT) is used to dynamically search for the extreme execution times. It can be shown that ERTT outperforms the traditional methods based on static analysis. However, during the evolutionary search, some parts of the source code are never accessed. Moreover, it turns out that ERTT delivers different extreme execution times in a high number of generations for the same test object, the results are neither reliable nor efficient. We propose a new approach to ERTT which makes use of seeding the evolutionary algorithm with test data achieving a high structural coverage. Using such test data ensures a comprehensive exploration of the search space and leads to rise the confidence in the results. We present also another improvement method based on restricting the range of the input variables in the initial population in order to reduce the search space. Experiments with these approaches demonstrate an increase of reliability in terms of constant extreme execution times and a gain in efficiency in terms of number of generations needed.|Marouane Tlili,Stefan Wappler,Harmen Sthamer","57638|GECCO|2006|Properties of symmetric fitness functions|The properties of symmetric fitness functions are investigated.

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems.

In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA.

The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

When the GA is initialized with a population close to the fitness peak, the GA will be able to stay close to the fitness peak. Roughly speaking, the parameter settings involve strong recombination, weak selection, and require mutation. This \"bistability\" phenomenon has been previously investigated with needle-in-the-haystack fitness functions, but this fitness, when used with a GA with random initialization, requires a population size exponential in the string length for the GA to have nontrivial behavior. We introduce sloping-plateau fitness functions which show the bistability phenomenon and should scale to arbitrary string lengths.

The approach introduced here aims at improving the exploration process of the SGA by adding a second search process through the way the solutions are coded.

Adequacy of one observer is computed by applying this specific encoding and evaluating how this observer is beneficial for the SGA run. The observers are trained for a specific time by a second evolutionary stage. During the evolution of the observers, the most suitable observer helps the SGA to find a solution to the tackled problem faster.

We devised a chromosome repairing method for hybrid genetic search, which helps exploit clusters when combined with gene reordering. Experimental tests showed that the suggested reordering scheme significantly improves the performance of genetic algorithms over previous reordering methods.|Inwook Hwang,Yong-Hyuk Kim,Byung Ro Moon","57741|GECCO|2006|A crossover operator for the anonymity problem|Recent dissemination of personal data has created an important optimization problem what is the minimal transformation of a dataset that is needed to guarantee the anonymity of the underlying individuals One natural representation for this problem is a bit-string, which makes a genetic algorithm a logical choice for optimization. Unfortunately, under certain realistic conditions, not all bit combinations will represent valid solutions. This means that in many instances, useful solutions are sparse in the search space. We implement a new crossover operator that preserves valid solutions under this representation. Our results show that this reproductive strategy is more efficient, effective, and robust than previous work. We also investigate how the population size and uniqueness can affect the performance of genetic search on this application.|Monte Lunacek,Darrell Whitley,Indrakshi Ray","57753|GECCO|2006|Spectral techniques for graph bisection in genetic algorithms|Various applications of spectral techniques for enhancing graph bisection in genetic algorithms are investigated. Several enhancements to a genetic algorithm for graph bisection are introduced based on spectral decompositions of adjacency matrices of graphs and subpopulation matrices. First, the spectral decompositions give initial populations for the genetic algorithm to start with. Next, spectral techniques are used to engineer new individuals and reorder the schema to strategically group certain sets of vertices together on the chromosome. The operators and techniques are found to be beneficial when added to a plain genetic algorithm and when used in conjunction with other local optimization techniques for graph bisection. In addition, several world record minimum bisections have been obtained from the methods described in this study.|Jacob G. Martin","57847|GECCO|2006|Comparative analysis of the sailor assignment problem|In this work the performance of several local search and metaheuristic methods is compared to previously reported work using evolutionary algorithms. The results show that while multiple algorithms are competitive on the Sailor Assignment Problem, the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm tend to provide the best performance. Additionally, some relevant features of the Sailor Assignment Problem are analyzed and used to explain the observed performance characteristics.|Joseph Vannucci,Deon Garrett,Dipankar Dasgupta"]]}}
