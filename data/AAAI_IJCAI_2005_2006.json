This approach has several novel features () agents can easily aggregate into arbitrary user-specified shapes, using a formation process that is independent of the number of agents () the system automatically adapts to influx and death of agents, as well as accidental displacement.

However, it holds the promise of greatly increasing the localization, mapping, and navigation ability of mobile robots. To help in scene understanding, objects in the field of vision must be extracted and represented in a fashion useful to the system. At the same time, methods must be in place for dealing with the large volume of data that stereo vision produces, in order that a practical frame rate may be obtained.

In order for coalitions to be stable, a key question that must be answered is how the gains from cooperation are to be distributed. Recent research has revealed that traditional solution concepts, such as the Shapley value, core, least core, and nucleolus, are vulnerable to various manipulations in open anonymous environments such as the Internet. These manipulations include submitting false names, collusion, and hiding some skills. To address this, a solution concept called the anonymity-proof core, which is robust against such manipulations, was developed. However, the representation size of the outcome function in the anonymity-proof core (and similar concepts) requires space exponential in the number of agentsskills. This paper proposes a compact representation of the outcome function, given that the characteristic function is represented using a recently introduced compact language that explicitly specifies only coalitions that introduce synergy. This compact representation scheme can successfully express the outcome function in the anonymity-proof core. Furthermore, this paper develops a new solution concept, the anonymity-proof nucleolus, that is also expressible in this compact representation. We show that the anonymity-proof nucleolus always exists, is unique, and is in the anonymity-proof core (if the latter is nonempty). and assigns the same value to symmetric skills.|Naoki Ohta,Atsushi Iwasaki,Makoto Yokoo,Kohki Maruono,Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm","65626|AAAI|2006|Quantifying Incentive Compatibility of Ranking Systems|Reasoning about agent preferences on a set of alternatives, and the aggregation of such preferences into some social ranking is a fundamental issue in reasoning about multi-agent systems. When the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide, we get the ranking systems setting. A famous type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines. Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered. In this paper we define three measures for quantifying the incentive compatibility of ranking systems. We apply these measures to several known ranking systems, such as PageRank, and prove tight bounds on the level of incentive compatibility under two basic properties strong monotonicity and non-imposition. We also introduce two novel nonimposing ranking systems, one general, and the other for the case of systems with three participants.

Examples of such large-scale, networked multi-agent systems include peer-to-peer networks, distributed information retrieval, and agent-based supply chains. One way of dealing with the uncertain and dynamic nature of such environments is to endow agents with the ability to modify the agent social network by autonomously adapting their local connectivity structure. In this paper, we present a framework for agent-organized networks (AONs) in the context of multi-agent production and exchange, and experimentally evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of specific AON strategies. We find that decentralized network adaptation can significantly improve organizational performance. Additionally, we analyze several properties of the resulting network structures and consider their relationship to the observed increase in organizational performance.|Matthew E.

The restriction of communication to neighboring hosts makes determining the global state especially difficult, if not impractical. This paper addresses the problem of coordinating the positions of an arbitrary number of services, encapsulated by mobile agents, in a dynamic peer-to-peer network. The agents' collective goal is to minimize the distance between hosts and services, even if the topology is changing constantly. We propose a distributed algorithm to efficiently calculate the stationary distribution of the network.

Finally, we show that the agent-based hill climbing approach is temporally-stable relative to the instantaneous optimum.|Evan Sultanik,William C.

VOs are an emerging means to model, enact, and manage large-scale computations. VOs consist of autonomous, heterogeneous members, often dynamic exhibiting complex behaviors. Thus, VOs are best modeled via multiagent systems. An agent can be an individual such as a person, business partner, or a resource. An agent may also be a VO. A VO is an agent that comprises other agents. Contracts provide a natural arms-length abstraction for modeling interaction among autonomous and heterogeneous agents. The interplay of contracts and VOs is the subject of this paper. The core of this paper is an approach to formalize VOs and contracts based on commitments. Our main contributions are () a formalization of VOs, () a discussion of certain key properties of VOs, and () an identification of a variety of VO structures and an analysis of how they support contract enactment. We evaluate our approach with an analysis of several scenarios involving the handling of exceptions and conflicts in contracts.|Yathiraj B. Udupi,Munindar P.

VCG mechanisms have received wide attention in the AI community because they are efficient and strategy-proof a special case of the Groves family of mechanisms, VCG mechanisms are the only direct-revelation mechanisms that are allocatively efficient and strategy-proof. Unfortunately, they are only weakly budget-balanced. We consider self-interested agents in a network flow domain, and show that in this domain, it is possible to design a mechanism that is both allocatively-efficient and almost completely budget-balanced. This is done by choosing a mechanism that is not strategy-proof but rather strategy-resistant. Instead of using the VCG mechanism, we propose a mechanism in which finding a beneficial manipulation is an NP-complete problem, and the payments from the agents to the mechanism may be minimized as much as desired.|Yoram Bachrach,Jeffrey S.

Although support vector machines (SVMs) have been a dominant machine learning technique for the past decade, they have generally been applied to supervised learning problems. Developing unsupervised extensions to SVMs has in fact proved to be difficult. In this paper, we present a principled approach to unsupervised SVM training by formulating convex relaxations of the natural training criterion find a labeling that would yield an optimal SVM classifier on the resulting training data. The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well. While previous work has concentrated on the two-class case, we present a general, multi-class formulation that can be applied to a wider range of natural data sets. The resulting training procedures are computationally intensive, but produce high quality generalization results.|Linli Xu,Dale Schuurmans","65718|AAAI|2006|Incremental Least-Squares Temporal Difference Learning|Approximate policy evaluation with linear function approximation is a commonly arising problem in reinforcement learning, usually solved using temporal difference (TD) algorithms. In this paper we introduce a new variant of linear TD learning, called incremental least-squares TD learning, or iLSTD. This method is more data efficient than conventional TD algorithms such as TD() and is more computationally efficient than non-incremental least-squares TD methods such as LSTD (Bradtke & Barto  Boyan ). In particular, we show that the per-time-step complexities of iLSTD and TD() are O(n), where n is the number of features, whereas that of LSTD is O(n). This difference can be decisive in modern applications of reinforcement learning where the use of a large number features has proven to be an effective solution strategy. We present empirical comparisons, using the test problem introduced by Boyan (), in which iLSTD converges faster than TD() and almost as fast as LSTD.|Alborz Geramifard,Michael H. Bowling,Richard S.

Our aim is to develop three kernels - one that makes use of knowledge derived from unlabeled text, the second using semantic knowledge from ontologies, and finally a third, additive kernel consisting of the first two kernels - and study their effect on the tasks of word sense disambiguation and automatic expansion of ambiguous acronyms.|Mahesh Joshi,Ted Pedersen,Richard Maclin,Serguei V.

However, an important open problem in the field is to identify the least restrictive set of assumptions and corresponding algorithms under which learning the optimal network becomes polynomial. In this paper, we present a technique for learning the skeleton of a Bayesian network, called Polynomial Max-Min Skeleton (PMMS), and compare It with Three Phase Dependency Analysis, another state-of-the-art polynomial algorithm. This analysis considers both the theoretical and empirical differences between the two algorithms, and demonstrates PMMS's advantages in both respects. When extended with a greedy hill-climbing Bayesian-scoring search to orient the edges, the novel algorithm proved more time efficient, scalable, and accurate in quality of reconstruction than most state-of-the-art Bayesian network learning algorithms. The results show promise of the existence of polynomial algorithms that are provably correct under minimal distributional assumptions.|Laura E. Brown,Ioannis Tsamardinos,Constantin F.

Our new method extends a recent advice-giving technique, called Knowledge-Based Kernel Regression (KBKR), that accepts advice concerning a single action of a reinforcement learner. In KBKR, users can say that in some set of states, an action's value should be greater than some linear expression of the current state. In our new technique, which we call Preference KBKR (Pref-KBKR), the user can provide advice in a more natural manner by recommending that some action is preferred over another in the specified set of states. Specifying preferences essentially means that users are giving advice about policies rather than Q values, which is a more natural way for humans to present advice. We present the motivation for preference advice and a proof of the correctness of our extension to KBKR. In addition, we show empirical results that our method can make effective use of advice on a novel reinforcement-learning task, based on the RoboCup simulator, which we call Breakaway. Our work demonstrates the significant potential of advice-giving techniques for addressing complex reinforcement learning problems, while further demonstrating the use of support-vector regression for reinforcement learning.|Richard Maclin,Jude W.

Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","16190|IJCAI|2005|An MCMC Approach to Solving Hybrid Factored MDPs|Hybrid approximate linear programming (HALP) has recently emerged as a promising framework for solving large factored Markov decision processes (MDPs) with discrete and continuous state and action variables.

Existing approaches that solve Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) suffer from the fact that they can only solve relatively small problems without complex constraints on task execution. OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings.

One important voting rule is the Slater rule.

The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates. We show that this technique suffices to compute a Slater ranking in linear time if the pairwise majority graph is hierarchically structured. For the general case, we also give an efficient algorithm for finding a set of similar candidates.

Beyond that, we see that among our studied systems no one system offers the best protection against destructive control. Rather, the choice of a preference aggregation system will depend closely on which types of control one wishes to be protected against. We also find concrete cases where the complexity of or susceptibility to control varies dramatically based on the choice among natural tie-handling rules.|Edith Hemaspaandra,Lane A.

We mainly focus on programs with monotone and antimonotone aggregates (LPm,aA programs). We define a new notion of unfounded set for (LPm,aA programs, and prove that it is a sound generalization of the standard notion of unfounded set for aggregate-free programs. We show that the answer sets of an LPm,aA program are precisely its unfounded-free models. We define a well-founded operator WP for LPm,aA programs we prove that its total fixpoints are precisely the answer sets of P, and its least fixpoint WPw() is contained in the intersection of all answer sets (if P admits an answer set). WPW() is efficiently computable, and for aggregate-free programs it coincides with the well-founded model. We carry out an in-depth complexity analysis in the general framework, including also nonmonotone aggregates. We prove that monotone and anti-monotone aggregates do not increase the complexity of cautious reasoning, which remains in co-NP. Nonmonotone aggregates, instead, do increase the complexity by one level in the polynomial hierarchy. Our results allow also to generalize and speed-up ASP systems with aggregates.|Francesco Calimeri,Wolfgang Faber,Nicola Leone,Simona Perri","65678|AAAI|2006|Improved Bounds for Computing Kemeny Rankings|Voting (or rank aggregation) is a general method for aggregating the preferences of multiple agents. One voting rule of particular interest is the Kemeny rule, which minimizes the number of cases where the final ranking disagrees with a vote on the order of two alternatives. Unfortunately, Kemeny rankings are NP-hard to compute. Recent work on computing Kemeny rankings has focused on producing good bounds to use in search-based methods. In this paper, we extend on this work by providing various improved bounding techniques. Some of these are based on cycles in the pairwise majority graph, others are based on linear programs. We completely characterize the relative strength of all of these bounds and provide some experimental results.|Vincent Conitzer,Andrew J.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm"],["65757|AAAI|2006|Diagnosis of Multi-Robot Coordination Failures Using Distributed CSP Algorithms|With increasing deployment of systems involving multiple coordinating agents, there is a growing need for diagnosing coordination failures in such systems.

In this paper we propose a distributed approach to model-based coordination failure diagnosis. We model the coordination between the agents as a constraint graph, and adapt several algorithms from the distributed CSP area, to use as the basis for the diagnosis algorithms. We evaluate the algorithms in extensive experiments with simulated and real Sony Aibo robots and show that in general a trade-off exists between the computational requirements of the algorithms, and their diagnosis results. Surprisingly, in contrast to results in distributed CSPs, the asynchronous backtracking algorithm outperforms stochastic local search in terms of both quality and runtime.|Meir Kalech,Gal A.

That is, each robot must be able to communicate with each other robot, perhaps through a series of other robots. Ideally, this property should be robust to the removal of any single robot from the system. In (Ahmadi & Stone a) we define a property of a team's communication graph that ensures this property, called biconnectivity. In that paper, a distributed algorithm to check if a team of robots is biconnected and its correctness proof are also presented. In this paper we provide distributed algorithms to add and remove robots tofrom a multi-robot team while maintaining the biconnected property. These two algorithms are implemented and tested in the PlayerStage simulator.|Mazda Ahmadi,Peter Stone","65629|AAAI|2006|Biconnected Structure for Multi-Robot Systems|Many applications of distributed autonomous robotic systems can benefit from, or even may require, the team of robots staying within communication connectivity. For example, consider the problem of multirobot surveillance (Ahmadi & Stone ), in which a team of robots must collaboratively patrol a given area. If any two robots can directly communicate at all times, the robots can coordinate for efficient behavior. This condition holds trivially in environments that are smaller than the robots' communication range. However in larger environments, the robots must actively maintain physical locations such that any two robots can communicate -- possibly through a series of other robots. Otherwise, the robots may lose track of each others' activities and become miscoordinated. Furthermore, since robots are relatively unreliable andor may need to change tasks (for example if a robot is suddenly called by a human user to perform some other task), in a stable multirobot surveillance system, if one of the robots leaves or crashes, the rest should still be able to communicate. Some examples of other tasks that could benefit from any pair of robots being able to communicate with each other, are multi-robot exploration, search and rescue, and cleaning robots. We say that robot R is connected to robot R if there is a series of robots, each within communication range of the previous, which can pass a message from R to R. It is not possible to maintain connectivity in the face of arbitrary numbers of robot departures if there are any two robots that are not within communication of one another and all other robots simultaneously depart, the system becomes disconnected. Thus we focus on the property of remaining robust to any single failure under the assumption that the team can readjust its positioning in response to a departure more quickly than a second departure will occur. In order for the team to stay connected, even in the face of any single departure, it must be the case that every robot is connected to each other robot either directly or via two distinct paths that do not share any robots in common. We call this property biconnectivity the removal of any one robot from the system does not disconnect the remaining robots from each other.|Mazda Ahmadi,Peter Stone","65458|AAAI|2005|Towards Model-Based Diagnosis of Coordination Failures|With increasing deployment of multi-agent and distributed systems, there is an increasing need for failure diagnosis systems. While successfully tackling key challenges in multi-agent settings, model-based diagnosis has left open the diagnosis of coordination failures, where failures often lie in the boundaries between agents, and thus the inputs to the model--with which the diagnoser simulates the system to detect discrepancies--are not known. However, it is possible to diagnose such failures using a model of the coordination between agents. This paper formalizes model-based coordination diagnosis, using two coordination primitives (concurrence and mutual exclusion). We define the consistency-based and abductive diagnosis problems within this formalization, and show that both are NP-Hard by mapping them to other known problems.|Meir Kalech,Gal A.

To be dependable, these groups must plan, carry out and adapt their activities in a way that is robust to failure and uncertainty. Previous work has produced contingent plan execution systems that provide robustness during their plan extraction phase, by choosing between functionally redundant methods, and during their execution phase, by dispatching temporally flexible plans. Previous contingent execution systems use a centralized architecture in which a single agent conducts planning for the entire group. This can result in a communication bottleneck at the time when plan activities are passed to the other agents for execution, and state information is returned. This paper introduces the plan extraction component of a robust, distributed executive for contingent plans. Contingent plans are encoded as Temporal Plan Networks (TPNs), which use a non-deterministic choice operator to compose temporally flexible plan fragments into a nested hierarchy of contingencies. To execute a TPN, the TPN is first distributed over multiple agents, by creating a hierarchical ad-hoc network and by mapping the TPN onto this hierarchy. Second, candidate plans are extracted from the TPN using a distributed, parallel algorithm that exploits the structure of the TPN. Third, the temporal consistency of each candidate plan is tested using a distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm. Each stage of plan extraction distributes communication to adjacent agents in the TPN, and in so doing eliminates communication bottlenecks. In addition, the distributed algorithm reduces the computational load on each agent. The algorithm is empirically validated on a range of randomly generated contingent plans.|Stephen A.

The agents need to ensure that the service providers they select are trustworthy. Because the agents are autonomous and there is no central trusted authority, the agents help each other determine the trustworthiness of the service providers they are interested in. This help is rendered via a series of referrals to other agents, culminating in zero or more trustworthy service providers being identified. A trust network is a multiagent system where each agent potentially rates the trustworthiness of another agent. This paper develops a formal treatment of trust networks. At the base is a recently proposed representation of trust via a probability certainty distribution. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of two operators, concatenation and aggregation, using which trust ratings can be combined in a trust network. This paper motivates and establishes some important properties regarding these operators, thereby ensuring that trust can be combined correctly.

To model a service, the user has to specify semantic types of the input and output data it uses and its functionality. As large number of new services come online, it is impractical to require the user to come up with a semantic model of the service or rely on the service providers to conform to a standard. Instead, we would like to automatically learn the semantic model of a new service. This paper addresses one part of the problem namely, automatically recognizing semantic types of the data used by Web services. We describe a metadata-based classification method for recognizing input data types using only the terms extracted from a Web Service Definition file. We then verify the classifier's predictions by invoking the service with some sample data of that type. Once we discover correct classification, we invoke the service to produce output data samples. We then use content-based classifiers to recognize semantic types of the output data.

Large action sets, however, have received considerably less attention. This paper demonstrates the use of knowledge transfer between related tasks to accelerate learning with large action sets. We introduce action transfer, a technique that extracts the actions from the (near-)optimal solution to the first task and uses them in place of the full action set when learning any subsequent tasks. When optimal actions make up a small fraction of the domain's action set, action transfer can substantially reduce the number of actions and thus the complexity of the problem. However, action transfer between dissimilar tasks can be detrimental. To address this difficulty, we contribute randomized task perturbation (RTP), an enhancement to action transfer that makes it robust to unrepresentative source tasks. We motivate RTP action transfer with a detailed theoretical analysis featuring a formalism of related tasks and a bound on the suboptimality of action transfer. The empirical results in this paper show the potential of RTP action transfer to substantially expand the applicability of RL to problems with large action sets.|Alexander A.

Wilson,Matthai Philipose","65922|AAAI|2006|Sample-Efficient Evolutionary Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning|Reinforcement learning problems are commonly tackled with temporal difference methods, which attempt to estimate the agent's optimal value function. In most real-world problems, learning this value function requires a function approximator, which maps state-action pairs to values via a concise, parameterized function. In practice, the success of function approximators depends on the ability of the human designer to select an appropriate representation for the value function. A recently developed approach called evolutionary function approximation uses evolutionary computation to automate the search for effective representations. While this approach can substantially improve the performance of TD methods, it requires many sample episodes to do so. We present an enhancement to evolutionary function approximation that makes it much more sample-efficient by exploiting the off-policy nature of certain TD methods. Empirical results in a server job scheduling domain demonstrate that the enhanced method can learn better policies than evolution or TD methods alone and can do so in many fewer episodes than standard evolutionary function approximation.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone","16041|IJCAI|2005|Sequential-Simultaneous Information Elicitation in Multi-Agent Systems|We introduce a general setting for information elicitation in multi-agent systems, where agents may be approached both sequentially and simultaneously in order to compute a function that depends on their private secrets. We consider oblivious mechanisms for sequential-simultaneous information elicitation. In such mechanisms the ordering of agents to be approached is fixed in advance. Surprisingly, we show that these mechanisms, which are easy to represent and implement are sufficient for very general settings, such as for the classical uniform model, where agents' secret bits are uniformly distributed, and for the computation of the majority function and other classical threshold functions. Moreover, we provide efficient algorithms for the verification of the existence of the desired elicitation mechanisms, and for synthesizing such mechanisms.|Gal Bahar,Moshe Tennenholtz","65912|AAAI|2006|Contract Enactment in Virtual Organizations A Commitment-Based Approach|A virtual organization (VO) is a dynamic collection of entities (individuals, enterprises, and information resources) collaborating on some computational activity. VOs are an emerging means to model, enact, and manage large-scale computations. VOs consist of autonomous, heterogeneous members, often dynamic exhibiting complex behaviors. Thus, VOs are best modeled via multiagent systems. An agent can be an individual such as a person, business partner, or a resource. An agent may also be a VO. A VO is an agent that comprises other agents. Contracts provide a natural arms-length abstraction for modeling interaction among autonomous and heterogeneous agents. The interplay of contracts and VOs is the subject of this paper. The core of this paper is an approach to formalize VOs and contracts based on commitments. Our main contributions are () a formalization of VOs, () a discussion of certain key properties of VOs, and () an identification of a variety of VO structures and an analysis of how they support contract enactment. We evaluate our approach with an analysis of several scenarios involving the handling of exceptions and conflicts in contracts.|Yathiraj B. Udupi,Munindar P.

Jin, ). A complicated function (the target function in ML or the fitness function in EC) may require an exponential amount of computation to learnevaluate, and thus approximations by simpler functions are needed. We consider the problem of approximating pseudo-Boolean functions by simpler (e.g., linear) functions when the instance space is associated with a probability distribution. We consider , n as a sample space with a (possibly nonuniform) probability measure on it, thus making pseudo-Boolean functions into random variables. This is also in the spirit of the PAC learning framework of Valiant Valiant,  where the instance space has a probability distribution on it. The best approximation to a target function f is then defined as the function g (from all possible approximating functions of the simpler form) that minimizes the expected distance to f. In an example, we use methods from linear algebra to find, in this more general setting, the best approximation to a given pseudo-Boolean function by a linear function.|Robert F.

The haplotype inference by pure parsimony (HIPP) problem consists in inferring haplotypes from genotypes S.t. the number of required haplotypes is minimum. Previous approaches to the HIPP problem have focused on integer programming models and branch-and-bound algorithms. In contrast, this paper proposes the utilization of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). The proposed solution entails a SAT model, a number of key pruning techniques, and an iterative algorithm that enumerates the possible solution values for the target optimization problem. Experimental results, obtained on a wide range of instances, demonstrate that the SAT-based approach can be several orders of magnitude faster than existing solutions. Besides being more efficient, the SAT-based approach is also the only capable of computing the solution for a large number of instances.|Inês Lynce,João Marques-Silva","16075|IJCAI|2005|A Model for Generating Random Quantified Boolean Formulas|The quantified boolean formula (QBF) problem is a powerful generalization of the boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem where variables can be both universally and existentially quantified.

It is of great importance from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in finding efficient solving techniques Alsinet et al.,  Xing and Zhang,  Shen and Zhang,  de Givry et al., . Most of this work focus on the computation of good quality lower bounds to be used within a branch and bound algorithm. Unfortunately, lower bounds are described in a procedural way. Because of that, it is difficult to realize the logic that is behind. In this paper we introduce a logical framework for Max-SAT solving. Using this framework, we introduce an extension of the Davis-Putnam algorithm (that we call Max-DPLL) and the resolution rule. Our framework has the advantage of nicely integrating branch and bound concepts such as the lower and upper bound, as well as hiding away implementation details. We show that Max-DPLL augmented with a restricted form of resolution at each branching point is an effective solving strategy. We also show that the resulting algorithm is closely related with some local consistency properties developed for weighted constraint satisfaction problems.|Javier Larrosa,Federico Heras","65538|AAAI|2005|SAT-Based versus CSP-Based Constraint Weighting for Satisfiability|Recent research has focused on bridging the gap between the satisfiability (SAT) and constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) formalisms. One approach has been to develop a many-valued SAT formula (MV-SAT) as an intermediate paradigm between SAT and CSP, and then to translate existing highly efficient SAT solvers to the MV-SAT domain. Experimental results have shown this approach can achieve significant improvements in performance compared with the traditional SAT and CSP approaches. In this paper, we follow a different route, developing SAT solvers that can automatically recognise CSP structure hidden in SAT encodings. This allows us to look more closely at how constraint weighting can be implemented in the SAT and CSP domains. Our experimental results show that a SAT-based approach to handle weights, together with CSP-based approach to variable instantiation, is superior to other combinations of SAT and CSP-based approaches. A further experiment on the round robin scheduling problem indicates that this many-valued constraint weighting approach outperforms other state-of-the-art solvers.|Duc Nghia Pham,John Thornton,Abdul Sattar,Abdelraouf Ishtaiwi","65351|AAAI|2005|The Achilles Heel of QBF|In recent years we have seen significant progress in the area of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving and its applications. As a new challenge, the community is now moving to investigate whether similar advances can be made in the use of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). QBF provides a natural framework for capturing problem solving and planning in multi-agent settings. However, contrarily to single-agent planning, which can be effectively formulated as SAT, we show that a QBF approach to planning in a multi-agent setting leads to significant unexpected computational difficulties. We identify as a key difficulty of the QBF approach the fact that QBF solvers often end up exploring a much larger search space than the natural search space of the original problem. This is in contrast to the experience with SAT approaches. We also show how one can alleviate these problems by introducing two special QBF formulations and a new QBF solution strategy. We present experiments that show the effectiveness of our approach in terms of a significant improvement in performance compared to earlier work in this area.

It vastly generalizes the NP-complete problem of propositional satisfiability, and hence is both highly useful and extremely expensive to solve in practice. We present a new approach to model counting that is based on adding a carefully chosen number of so-called streamlining constraints to the input formula in order to cut down the size of its solution space in a controlled manner. Each of the additional constraints is a randomly chosen XOR or parity constraint on the problem variables, represented either directly or in the standard CNF form. Inspired by a related yet quite different theoretical study of the properties of XOR constraints, we provide a formal proof that with high probability, the number of XOR constraints added in order to bring the formula to the boundary of being unsatisfiable determines with high precision its model count. Experimentally, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to obtain good bounds on the model counts for formulas that are far beyond the reach of exact counting methods. In fact, we obtain the first non-trivial solution counts for very hard, highly structured combinatorial problem instances. Note that unlike other counting techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we are able to provide high-confidence guarantees on the quality of the counts obtained.|Carla P.

ASSAT and CMODELS are two well-known such systems. They find an answer set from the full models for the completion of the input program, which is (iteratively) augmented with loop formulas. Making use of the fact that, for non-tight programs, during the model generation, a partial assignment may be extensible to a full model but may not grow into any answer set, we propose to add answer set extensibility checking on partial assignments. Furthermore, given a partial assignment, we identify a class of loop formulas that are \"active\" on the assignment. These \"active\" formulas can be used to prune the search space. We also provide an efficient method to generate these formulas. These ideas can be implemented with a moderate modification on SAT solvers. We have developed a new answer set solver SAG on top of the SAT solver MCHAFF. Empirical studies on well-known benchmarks show that in most cases it is faster than the state-of-the-art answer set solvers, often by an order of magnitude. In the few cases when it is not the winner, it is close to the top performer, which shows its robustness.|Zhijun Lin,Yuanlin Zhang,Hector Hernandez","65502|AAAI|2005|A Framework for Representing and Solving NP Search Problems|NP search and decision problems occur widely in AI, and a number of general-purpose methods for solving them have been developed.

In this paper we propose MC-SAT, an inference algorithm that combines ideas from MCMC and satisfiability. MC-SAT is based on Markov logic, which defines Markov networks using weighted clauses in first-order logic. From the point of view of MCMC, MC-SAT is a slice sampler with an auxiliary variable per clause, and with a satisfiability-based method for sampling the original variables given the auxiliary ones. From the point of view of satisfiability, MCSAT wraps a procedure around the SampleSAT uniform sampler that enables it to sample from highly non-uniform distributions over satisfying assignments. Experiments on entity resolution and collective classification problems show that MC-SAT greatly outperforms Gibbs sampling and simulated tempering over a broad range of problem sizes and degrees of determinism.|Hoifung Poon,Pedro Domingos"],["65454|AAAI|2005|Generating Hard Satisfiable Formulas by Hiding Solutions Deceptively|To test incomplete search algorithms for constraint satisfaction problems such as -SAT, we need a source of hard, but satisfiable, benchmark instances. A simple way to do this is to choose a random truth assignment A, and then choose clauses randomly from among those satisfied by A. However, this method tends to produce easy problems, since the majority of literals point toward the \"hidden\" assignment A. Last year, (Achlioptas, Jia, & Moore ) proposed a problem generator that cancels this effect by hiding both A and its complement A. While the resulting formulas appear to be just as hard for DPLL algorithms as random -SAT formulas with no hidden assignment, they can be solved by WalkSAT in only polynomial time. Here we propose a new method to cancel the attraction to A, by choosing a clause with t   literals satisfied by A with probability proportional to qt for some q  . By varying q, we can generate formulas whose variables have no bias, i.e., which are equally likely to be true or false we can even cause the formula to \"deceptively\" point away from A.

PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs.

In addition many dynamical systems have memories that can serve as landmarks that completely determine the current state. The detection and recognition of landmarks is advantageous because they can serve to reset a model that has gotten off-track, as often happens when the model is learned from samples. This paper develops both memory-PSRs and the use and detection of landmarks.|Michael R. James,Britton Wolfe,Satinder P.

One important voting rule is the Slater rule. It selects a ranking of the alternatives (or candidates) to minimize the number of pairs of candidates such that the ranking disagrees with the pairwise majority vote on these two candidates. The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates. We show that this technique suffices to compute a Slater ranking in linear time if the pairwise majority graph is hierarchically structured. For the general case, we also give an efficient algorithm for finding a set of similar candidates. We provide experimental results that show that this technique significantly (sometimes drastically) speeds up search algorithms, Finally, we also use the technique of similar sets to show that computing an optimal Slater ranking is NP-hard. even in the absence of pairwise ties.|Vincent Conitzer","65757|AAAI|2006|Diagnosis of Multi-Robot Coordination Failures Using Distributed CSP Algorithms|With increasing deployment of systems involving multiple coordinating agents, there is a growing need for diagnosing coordination failures in such systems. Previous work presented centralized methods for coordination failure diagnosis however, these are not always applicable, due to the significant computational and communication requirements, and the brittleness of a single point of failure. In this paper we propose a distributed approach to model-based coordination failure diagnosis. We model the coordination between the agents as a constraint graph, and adapt several algorithms from the distributed CSP area, to use as the basis for the diagnosis algorithms. We evaluate the algorithms in extensive experiments with simulated and real Sony Aibo robots and show that in general a trade-off exists between the computational requirements of the algorithms, and their diagnosis results. Surprisingly, in contrast to results in distributed CSPs, the asynchronous backtracking algorithm outperforms stochastic local search in terms of both quality and runtime.|Meir Kalech,Gal A.

The proposed method operates locally in neighborhoods and does not involve any global computations. It is based on information propagation among neighboring points implemented as a voting process. Unlike other local approaches for manifold learning, the quantity propagated from one point to another is not a scalar, but is in the form of a tensor that provides considerably richer information. The accumulation of votes at each point provides a reliable estimate of local dimensionality, as well as of the orientation of a potential manifold going through the point. Reliable dimensionality estimation at the point level is a major advantage over competing methods. Moreover, the absence of global operations allows us to process significantly larger datasets.

While successfully tackling key challenges in multi-agent settings, model-based diagnosis has left open the diagnosis of coordination failures, where failures often lie in the boundaries between agents, and thus the inputs to the model--with which the diagnoser simulates the system to detect discrepancies--are not known. However, it is possible to diagnose such failures using a model of the coordination between agents. This paper formalizes model-based coordination diagnosis, using two coordination primitives (concurrence and mutual exclusion). We define the consistency-based and abductive diagnosis problems within this formalization, and show that both are NP-Hard by mapping them to other known problems.|Meir Kalech,Gal A.

Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered. In this paper we define three measures for quantifying the incentive compatibility of ranking systems. We apply these measures to several known ranking systems, such as PageRank, and prove tight bounds on the level of incentive compatibility under two basic properties strong monotonicity and non-imposition. We also introduce two novel nonimposing ranking systems, one general, and the other for the case of systems with three participants.

That is, we study the ability of an election's chair to, through such mechanisms as votercandidate additionsuppressionpartition, ensure that a particular candidate (equivalently, alternative) does not win. And we study the extent to which election systems can make it impossible, or computationally costly (NP-complete), for the chair to execute such control. Among the systems we study--plurality, Condorcet, and approval voting--we find cases where systems immune or computationally resistant to a chair choosing the winner nonetheless are vulnerable to the chair blocking a victory. Beyond that, we see that among our studied systems no one system offers the best protection against destructive control. Rather, the choice of a preference aggregation system will depend closely on which types of control one wishes to be protected against.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it.

Furthermore, while previous work investigated the impact on efficiency of distributed contraint reasoning design decisions (e.g. constraint-graph topology, asynchrony, message-contents), this paper examines the privacy aspect of such decisions, providing an improved understanding of privacy-efficiency tradeoffs.|Rachel Greenstadt,Jonathan P.

In contrast to the traditional semiring-based formalism that annotates legal tuples of a constraint with preferences, our framework instead assigns elementary costs to the constraints themselves. After proving that the VDTP can express the same set of utilitarian optimal solutions as the DTPP with piecewise-constant preference functions, we develop a method for achieving weighted constraint satisfaction within a meta-CSP search space that has traditionally been used to solve DTPs without preferences. This allows us to directly incorporate several powerful techniques developed in previous decision-based DTP literature.

The method is based on designing sequential control variates using successive approximations of the function of interest V. Regular Monte Carlo estimates have a variance of O(N), where N is the number of samples. Here, we obtain a geometric variance reduction O(N) (with   ) up to a threshold that depends on the approximation error V - AV, where A is an approximation operator linear in the values. Thus, if V belongs to the right approximation space (i.e. AV  V), the variance decreases geometrically to zero. An immediate application is value function estimation in Markov chains, which may be used for policy evaluation in policy iteration for Markov Decision Processes. Another important domain, for which variance reduction is highly needed, is gradient estimation, that is computing the sensitivity , V of the performance measure V with respect to some parameter  of the transition probabilities. For example, in parametric optimization of the policy, an estimate of the policy gradient is required to perform a gradient optimization method.

We extend our previous work on functional value iteration from one-switch utility functions to all utility functions that can be approximated with piecewise linear utility functions (with and without exponential tails) by using functional value iteration to find a plan that maximizes the expected total utility for the approximate utility function. Functional value iteration does not maintain a value for every state but a value function that maps the total reward that has been accumulated so far into a value.

These risks are normally mitigated by using a soft margin criterion, such as hinge loss, to reduce outlier sensitivity. In this paper, we present a more direct approach that explicitly incorporates outlier suppression in the training process. In particular, we show how outlier detection can be encoded in the large margin training principle of support vector machines. By expressing a convex relaxation of the joint training problem as a semide finite program, one can use this approach to robustly train a support vector machine while suppressing outliers. We demonstrate that our approach can yield superior results to the standard soft margin approach in the presence of outliers.|Linli Xu,Koby Crammer,Dale Schuurmans","65544|AAAI|2005|Towards Learning Stochastic Logic Programs from Proof-Banks|Stochastic logic programs combine ideas from probabilistic grammars with the expressive power of definite clause logic as such they can be considered as an extension of probabilistic context-free grammars.

Interactive Web search divides the search process into several rounds, and for each round the search engine interacts with the user for more knowledge of the user's information requirement. Previous research mainly uses the text information on Web pages, while little attention is paid to other modalities. This article shows that Web search performance can be significantly improved if imagery is considered in interactive Web search. Compared with text, imagery has its own advantage the time for &ldquoreading&rdquo an image is as little as that for reading one or two words, while the information brought by an image is as much as that conveyed by a whole passage of text. In order to exploit the advantages of imagery, a novel interactive Web search framework is proposed, where image snippets are first extracted from Web pages and then provided, along with the text snippets, to the user for result presentation and relevance feedback, as well as being presented alone to the user for image suggestion. User studies show that it is more convenient for the user to identify the Web pages he or she expects and to reformulate the initial query.

Because in many practical cases, sets of assignments can be represented implicitly and compactly using symbolic techniques such as decision diagrams, the set-based algorithm can compute bounds faster than explicitly searching over individual assignments, while memory explosion can be avoided by limiting the size of the sets. Varying the size of the sets yields a family of algorithms that includes known search and inference algorithms as special cases.

In contrast to the traditional semiring-based formalism that annotates legal tuples of a constraint with preferences, our framework instead assigns elementary costs to the constraints themselves. After proving that the VDTP can express the same set of utilitarian optimal solutions as the DTPP with piecewise-constant preference functions, we develop a method for achieving weighted constraint satisfaction within a meta-CSP search space that has traditionally been used to solve DTPs without preferences. This allows us to directly incorporate several powerful techniques developed in previous decision-based DTP literature.

Recent advances in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have made use of the quickly spreading nature of these attacks to identify them with high sensitivity and at low false positive (FP) rates. However, slowly propagating attacks are much more difficult to detect because they are cloaked under the veil of normal network traffic, yet can be just as dangerous due to their exponential spread pattern. We extend the idea of using collaborative IDSs to corroborate the likelihood of attack by imbuing end hosts with probabilistic graphical models and using random messaging to gossip state among peer detectors. We show that such a system is able to boost a weak anomaly detector D to detect an order-of-magnitude slower worm, at false positive rates less than a few per week, than would be possible using D alone at the end-host or on a network aggregation point. We show that this general architecture is scalable in the sense that a fixed absolute false positive rate can be achieved as the network size grows, spreads communication bandwidth uniformly throughout the network, and makes use of the increased computation power of a distributed system. We argue that using probabilistic models provides more robust detections than previous collaborative counting schemes and allows the system to account for heterogeneous detectors in a principled fashion.|Denver Dash,Branislav Kveton,John Mark Agosta,Eve M.

While it is generally easy to design information elicitation mechanisms that motivate the seller to be truthful, we show that if the seller has additional relevant information it does not want to reveal, the buyer must resort to elicitation mechanisms that work only some of the time. The optimal design of such mechanisms is shown to be computationally hard. We show two different algorithms to solve the mechanism design problem, each appropriate (from a complexity point of view) in different scenarios.|Aviv Zohar,Jeffrey S.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs. Our empirical results show that our modified IP on mPSRs outperforms, in most cases, IP on both PSRs and POMDPs.|Michael R. James,Satinder P.

Predictive state representations (PSRs) are a type of model that uses predictions about future observations to capture the state of a dynamical system. However, PSRs do not use memory of past observations. We propose a model called memory-PSRs that uses both memories of the past, and predictions of the future. We show that the use of memories provides a number of potential advantages. It can reduce the size of the model (in comparison to a PSR model). In addition many dynamical systems have memories that can serve as landmarks that completely determine the current state. The detection and recognition of landmarks is advantageous because they can serve to reset a model that has gotten off-track, as often happens when the model is learned from samples. This paper develops both memory-PSRs and the use and detection of landmarks.|Michael R. James,Britton Wolfe,Satinder P.

Scoring rules, like many other mechanisms set in a probabilistic environment, assume that all participating agents share some common belief about the underlying probability of events. In real-life situations however, underlying distributions are not known precisely, and small differences in beliefs about these distributions may alter agent behavior under the prescribed mechanism.We propose designing elicitation mechanisms in a manner that will be robust to small changes in belief.

This paper proposes a novel framework generalizing Samuel's paradigm using a coordinate-free approach to value function approximation. Agents learn both representations and value functions by constructing geometrically customized task-independent basis functions that form an orthonormal set for the Hilbert space of smooth functions on the underlying state space manifold. The approach rests on a technical result showing that the space of smooth functions on a (compact) Riemanian manifold has a discrete spectrum associated with the Laplace-Beltrami operator. In the discrete setting, spectral analysis of the graph Laplacian yields a set of geometrically customized basis functions for approximating and decomposing value functions. The proposed framework generalizes Samuel's value function approximation paradigm by combining it with a formalization of Saul Amarel's paradigm of representation learning through global state space analysis.|Sridhar Mahadevan"],["65583|AAAI|2005|Mobile Robot Mapping and Localization in Non-Static Environments|Whenever mobile robots act in the real world, they need to be able to deal with non-static objects.

In order for coalitions to be stable, a key question that must be answered is how the gains from cooperation are to be distributed. Recent research has revealed that traditional solution concepts, such as the Shapley value, core, least core, and nucleolus, are vulnerable to various manipulations in open anonymous environments such as the Internet. These manipulations include submitting false names, collusion, and hiding some skills. To address this, a solution concept called the anonymity-proof core, which is robust against such manipulations, was developed. However, the representation size of the outcome function in the anonymity-proof core (and similar concepts) requires space exponential in the number of agentsskills. This paper proposes a compact representation of the outcome function, given that the characteristic function is represented using a recently introduced compact language that explicitly specifies only coalitions that introduce synergy. This compact representation scheme can successfully express the outcome function in the anonymity-proof core. Furthermore, this paper develops a new solution concept, the anonymity-proof nucleolus, that is also expressible in this compact representation. We show that the anonymity-proof nucleolus always exists, is unique, and is in the anonymity-proof core (if the latter is nonempty). and assigns the same value to symmetric skills.|Naoki Ohta,Atsushi Iwasaki,Makoto Yokoo,Kohki Maruono,Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm","65744|AAAI|2006|Belief Change in the Context of Fallible Actions and Observations|We consider the iterated belief change that occurs following an alternating sequence of actions and observations.

Of particular interest is the way in which new beliefs are acquired and determined and old beliefs are retained or discarded.

It is therefore not surprising that the term 'theory revision' is used to describe this process Ourston and Mooney, .

Based on these notions, we then propose a framework for conflict solving in logic programs, which is general enough to represent many important conflict solving problems.

These approaches generalize the fixpoint-based and the level mapping based answer set semantics of normal logic programs to the case of logic programs with arbitrary types of c-atoms. The results are four different answer set definitions which are equivalent when applied to normal logic programs. The standard fixpoint-based semantics of logic programs is generalized in two directions, called answer set by reduct and answer set by complement. These definitions, which differ from each other in the treatment of negation-as-failure (naf) atoms, make use of an immediate consequence operator to perform answer set checking, whose definition relies on the notion of conditional satisfaction of c-atoms w.r.t. a pair of interpretations. The other two definitions, called strongly and weakly well-supported models, are generalizations of the notion of well-supported models of normal logic programs to the case of programs with c-atoms. As for the case of fixpoint-based semantics, the difference between these two definitions is rooted in the treatment of naf atoms. We prove that answer sets by reduct (resp. by complement) are equivalent to weakly (resp. strongly) well-supported models of a program, thus generalizing the theorem on the correspondence between stable models and well-supported models of a normal logic program to the class of programs with c-atoms. We show that the newly defined semantics coincide with previously introduced semantics for logic programs with monotone c-atoms, and they extend the original answer set semantics of normal logic programs.

Meanwhile, virtually all these problems require classifiers that minimize a nonuniform loss function associated with the classification decisions (rather than the accuracy or number of errors). For example, to train pattern classification models for a network intrusion detection task, experts need to analyze network events and assign them labels. This can be a very costly procedure if the instances to be labeled are selected at random. In the meantime, the loss associated with mislabeling an intrusion is much higher than the loss associated with the opposite error (i.e., labeling a legal event as being an intrusion). As a result, to address these types of tasks, practitioners need tools that minimize the total cost computed as a sum of the cost of labeling and the loss associated with the decisions.

Our object recognition approach assigns natural categories (e.g. \"desk\", \"chair\", \"table\") to new objects based on their functional design. With basic objects within the environment classified, we can then make use of a computational reference model, to process natural projective relations (e.g. \"the briefcase to the left of the chair\"), allowing users to refer to objects which cannot be classified reliably by the recognition system alone.|Reinhard Moratz","16305|IJCAI|2005|Inter-Agent Communication A Cost-Reduction Approach Using an Autonomous Mobile Mailbox|In this paper, we consider a mobile mailbox communication scheme to reduce inter-agent communication costs.

Integration of such a high number of capabilities revealed interesting new issues such as coordinating audiovisualgraphical capabilities, monitoring the impacts of the capabilities in usage by the robot, and inferring the robot's intentions and goals. Our  entry will be used to address these issues, to add new capabilities to the robot and to improve our software and computational architectures, with the objective of increasing, evaluating and improving our understanding of human-robot interaction and integration with an autonomous mobile platform.|François Michaud,Dominic Létourneau,M.

Most popular approaches are computationally expensive, involve an extensive off-line training phase andor rely on a stationary camera. This paper presents an approach for color learning on-board a legged robot with limited computational and memory resources. A key defining feature of the approach is that it works without any labeled training data. Rather, it trains autonomously from a color-coded model of its environment. The process is fully implemented, completely autonomous, and provides high degree of segmentation accuracy.|Mohan Sridharan,Peter Stone","65863|AAAI|2006|From the Programmers Apprentice to Human-Robot Interaction Thirty Years of Research on Human-Computer Collaboration|We summarize the continuous thread of research we have conducted over the past thirty years on human-computer collaboration.

To this end, various groups have collected repositories of common sense in machine-readable form. However, efforts to apply these large bodies of knowledge to enable correspondingly large-scale sensor-based understanding of the world have been few. Challenges have included semantic gaps between facts in the repositories and phenomena detected by sensors, fragility of reasoning in the face of noise, incompleteness of repositories, and slowness of reasoning with these large repositories. We show how to address these problems with a combination of novel sensors, probabilistic representation, web-scale information retrieval and approximate reasoning. In particular, we show how to use the ,-fact hand-entered Open-Mind Indoor Common Sense database to interpret sensor traces of day-to-day activities with % accuracy (which is easy) and % precisionrecall (which is not).|William Pentney,Ana-Maria Popescu,Shiaokai Wang,Henry A.

We believe that such semantic information enables a mobile robot to more efficiently accomplish a variety of tasks such as human-robot interaction, path-planning, or localization. This paper presents a supervised learning approach to label different locations using boosting. We train a classifier using features extracted from vision and laser range data. Furthermore, we apply a Hidden Markov Model to increase the robustness of the final classification. Our technique has been implemented and tested on real robots as well as in simulation. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can be utilized to robustly classify places into semantic categories. We also present an example of localization using semantic labeling.|Axel Rottmann,\u201Cscar Martínez Mozos,Cyrill Stachniss,Wolfram Burgard","65738|AAAI|2006|Object Boundary Detection in Images using a Semantic Ontology|We present a novel method for detecting the boundaries between objects in images that uses a large, hierarchical, semantic ontology - WordNet. The semantic object hierarchy in WordNet grounds this ill-posed segmentation problem, so that true boundaries are defined as edges between instances of different classes, and all other edges are clutter. To avoid fully classifying each pixel, which is very difficult in generic images, we evaluate the semantic similarity of the two regions bounding each edge in an initial oversegmentation. Semantic similarity is computed using WordNet enhanced with appearance information, and is largely orthogonal to visual similarity. Hence two regions with very similar visual attributes, but from different categories, can have a large semantic distance and therefore evidence of a strong boundary between them, and vice versa. The ontology is trained with images from the UC Berkeley image segmentation benchmark, extended with manual labeling of the semantic content of each image segment. Results on boundary detection against the benchmark images show that semantic similarity computed through WordNet can significantly improve boundary detection compared to generic segmentation.|Anthony Hoogs,Roderic Collins","65756|AAAI|2006|Using Semantic Web Technologies for Policy Management on the Web|With policy management becoming popular as a means of providing flexible Web security, the number of policy languages being proposed for the Web is constantly increasing. We recognize the importance of policies for securing the Web and believe that the future will only bring more policy languages. We do not, however, believe that users should be forced to conform the description of their policy relationships to a single standard policy language. Instead there should be a way of encompassing different policy languages and supporting heterogeneous policy systems. As a step in this direction, we propose Rein, a policy framework grounded in Semantic Web technologies, which leverages the distributed nature and linkability of the Web to provide Web-based policy management. Rein provides ontologies for describing policy domains in a decentralized manner and provides an engine for reasoning over these descriptions, both of which can be used to develop domain and policy language specific security systems. We describe the Rein policy framework and discuss how a Rein policy management systems can be developed for access control in an online photo sharing application.|Lalana Kagal,Tim Berners-Lee,Dan Connolly,Daniel J.

However, there is not yet any large and widely deployed set of semantically annotated Web resources available. As a result, it is not possible to evaluate the use of the technology in a real environment, and several assumptions about how the Semantic Web should work are emerging. In order to further investigate these assumptions and the related technology, we propose a simulation and evaluation platform. The platform provides tools to create Semantic Web simulations using different technologies for different purposes, and to evaluate their performance. In this paper we introduce the model of the platform and describe the current implementation. The implementation facilitates the integration of technology for an essential operation on the Semantic Web, namely Semantic Web service discovery. We illustrate the use of the platform in a case study by implementing a Semantic Web where the Jade multi-agent platform provides the framework to describe the agents, and a number of existing Semantic Web technologies are embedded in agent behavior.|Cécile Aberg,Johan Aberg,Patrick Lambrix,Nahid Shahmehri","65929|AAAI|2006|Improve Web Search Using Image Snippets|The Web has become the largest information repository in the world thus, effectively and efficiently searching the Web becomes a key challenge. Interactive Web search divides the search process into several rounds, and for each round the search engine interacts with the user for more knowledge of the user's information requirement. Previous research mainly uses the text information on Web pages, while little attention is paid to other modalities. This article shows that Web search performance can be significantly improved if imagery is considered in interactive Web search. Compared with text, imagery has its own advantage the time for &ldquoreading&rdquo an image is as little as that for reading one or two words, while the information brought by an image is as much as that conveyed by a whole passage of text. In order to exploit the advantages of imagery, a novel interactive Web search framework is proposed, where image snippets are first extracted from Web pages and then provided, along with the text snippets, to the user for result presentation and relevance feedback, as well as being presented alone to the user for image suggestion. User studies show that it is more convenient for the user to identify the Web pages he or she expects and to reformulate the initial query. Further experiments demonstrate the promise of introducing multimodal techniques into the proposed interactive Web search framework.|Xiao-Bing Xue,Zhi-Hua Zhou,Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang","16244|IJCAI|2005|Building the Semantic Web Tower from RDF Straw|A same-syntax extension of RDF to first-order logic results in a collapse of the model theory due to logical paradoxes resulting from diagonalization.

Web opinion mining extracts subjective information from the Web for specific targets, summarizes the polarity and the degree of the information, and tracks the development over time. Targets which gain similar opinionated tendencies within a period of time may be correlated. This paper detects event bursts from the tracking plots of opinions, and decides the strength of the relationship using the coverage of the plots. Companies are selected as the experimental targets. A total of ,, economics-related documents are collected from  Web sources between August  and May  for experiments. Models that discover relations are then proposed and compared on the basis of their performance. There are three types of models, collocation-based, opinion-based, and integration models, and respectively, four, two and two variants of each type. For evaluation, company pairs which demonstrate similar oscillation of stock prices are considered correlated and are selected as the gold standard. The results show that collocation-based models and opinion-based models are complementary, and the integration models perform the best.
