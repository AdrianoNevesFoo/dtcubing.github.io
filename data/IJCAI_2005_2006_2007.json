In this paper we are concerned with developing graph-based unsupervised algorithms for alleviating the data requirements for large scale WSD. Under this framework, finding the right sense for a given word amounts to identifying the most \"important\" node among the set of graph nodes representing its senses. We propose a variety of measures that analyze the connectivity of graph structures, thereby identifying the most relevant word senses.

However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction. Simple examples are given in order to show the advantages of the algorithm.|Marc G.

However, not all partially observable Markov decision processes can be efficiently learned with TD networks. In this paper, we extend TD networks by allowing the network-update process (answer network) to depend on the recent history of previous actions and observations rather than only on the most recent action and observation. We show that this extension enables the solution of a larger class of problems than can be solved by the original TD networks or by history-based methods alone. In addition, we apply TD networks to a problem that, while still simple, is significantly larger than has previously been considered. We show that history-extended TD networks can learn much of the common-sense knowledge of an egocentric gridworld domain with a single bit of perception.|Brian Tanner,Richard S.

Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","16413|IJCAI|2007|Word Sense Disambiguation through Sememe Labeling|Currently most word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems are relatively individual word sense experts. Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model. Syntactic and hypernym features can enhance the performance significantly.|Xiangyu Duan,Jun Zhao,Bo Xu","16784|IJCAI|2007|A Flexible Unsupervised PP-Attachment Method Using Semantic Information|In this paper we revisit the classical NLP problem of prepositional phrase attachment (PP-attachment). Given the pattern V -NP-P-NP in the text, where V is verb, NP is a noun phrase, P is the preposition and NP is the other noun phrase, the question asked is where does P - NP attach V or NP This question is typically answered using both the word and the world knowledge. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution. Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach. The unambiguous V - P - N and N - P -N tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N - P - N tuples of the test corpus. A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation (WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of Vs and Ns in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP, NP - P - NP. For experimentation, Brown Corpus provides the training data andWall Street Journal Corpus the test data. The accuracy obtained for PP-attachment resolution is close to %. The novelty of the system lies in the flexible use of WSD and DSR phases.|Srinivas Medimi,Pushpak Bhattacharyya","16267|IJCAI|2005|Conditional Planning in the Discrete Belief Space|Probabilistic planning with observability restrictions, as formalized for example as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), has a wide range of applications, but it is computationally extremely difficult.

In this paper we show that tractable sub-classes of propositional linear temporal logic can be developed, based on the use of XOR fragments of the logic. We not only show that such fragments can be decided, tractably, via clausal temporal resolution, but also show the benefits of combining multiple XOR fragments. For such combinations we establish completeness and complexity (of the resolution method), and also describe how such a temporal language might be used in application areas, for example the verification of multi-agent systems. This new approach to temporal reasoning provides a framework in which tractable temporal logics can be engineered by intelligently combining appropriate XOR fragments.|Clare Dixon,Michael Fisher,Boris Konev","16662|IJCAI|2007|Contextual Default Reasoning|In this paper we introduce a multi-context variant of Reiter's default logic.

Our results show that in the propositional setting, where reasoning is well-known to be polynomial, deciding strong and uniform equivalence is as hard as for arbitrary normal logic programs (and thus coNP-complete), but is polynomial in some restricted cases. Nonground programs behave similarly. However, exponential lower bounds already hold for small programs (i.e., with constantly many rules). In particular, uniform equivalence is undecidable even for small Horn programs plus a single negative constraint.|Thomas Eiter,Michael Fink,Hans Tompits,Stefan Woltran","16539|IJCAI|2007|Epistemic Reasoning in Logic Programs|Although epistemic logic programming has an enhanced capacity to handle complex incomplete information reasoning and represent agents' epistemic behaviours, it embeds a significantly higher computational complexity than non-disjunctive and disjunctive answer set programming.

In particular, we show that Lee and Lifschitz's result on loop formulas for disjunctive logic programs can be extended to a special class of epistemic logic programs. We also study the polysize model property for epistemic logic programs. Based on these discoveries, we identify two non-trivial classes of epistemic logic programs whose consistency checking complexity is reduced from PSPACE-complete to NP-complete and P -complete respectively.

Although much effort has been made to design efficient standalone AC algorithms, there is no systematic study on how to efficiently enforce AC during search, as far as we know. The significance of the latter is clear given the fact that AC will be enforced millions of times in solving hard problems. In this paper, we propose a framework for enforcing AC during search (ACS) and complexity measurements of ACS algorithms. Based on this framework, several ACS algorithms are designed to take advantage of the residual data left in the data structures by the previous invocation(s) of ACS. The algorithms vary in the worst-case time and space complexity and other complexity measurements.

The backtrack algorithms that maintain some local consistency during search have become the de facto standard to solve CSPs. Maintaining higher levels of consistency, generally, reduces the search effort. However, due to ineffective constraint propagation, it often penalises the search algorithm in terms of time. If we can reduce ineffective constraint propagation, then the effectiveness of a search algorithm can be enhanced significantly. In order to do so, we use a probabilistic approach to resolve when to propagate and when not to. The idea is to perform only the useful consistency checking by not seeking a support when there is a high probability that a support exists. The idea of probabilistic support inference is general and can be applied to any kind of local consistency algorithm. However, we shall study its impact with respect to arc consistency and singleton arc consistency (SAC). Experimental results demonstrate that enforcing probabilistic SAC almost always enforces SAC, but it requires significantly less time than SAC. Likewise, maintaining probabilistic arc consistency and maintaining probabilistic SAC require significantly less time than maintaining arc consistency and maintaining SAC.|Deepak Mehta,Marc R.

It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood.

First, it learns views that introduce new relational tables, rather than merely new fields for an existing table of the database. Second, new tables or new fields are not limited to being approximations to some target concept instead, the new approach performs a type of predicate invention. The new approach avoids the classical problem with predicate invention, of learning many useless predicates, by keeping only new fields or tables (i.e., new predicates) that immediately improve the performance of the statistical model.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design. Our contribution is the introduction of a general technique for designing SVM kernels tailored for the classification of sequence data.|Young-In Shin,Donald S.

Some special structure BNCs have been proposed and demonstrate promise performance. However, recent researches show that structure learning in BNs may lead to a non-negligible posterior problem, i.e, there might be many structures have similar posterior scores. In this paper, we propose a generalized additive Bayesian network classifiers, which transfers the structure learning problem to a generalized additive models (GAM) learning problem. We first generate a series of very simple BNs, and put them in the framework of GAM, then adopt a gradient-based algorithm to learn the combining parameters, and thus construct a more powerful classifier. On a large suite of benchmark data sets, the proposed approach outperforms many traditional BNCs, such as naive Bayes, TAN, etc, and achieves comparable or better performance in comparison to boosted Bayesian network classifiers.|Jianguo Li,Changshui Zhang,Tao Wang,Yimin Zhang"],["16763|IJCAI|2007|Exploiting Independence in a Decentralised and Incremental Approach of Diagnosis|It is well-known that the size of the model is a bottleneck when using model-based approaches to diagnose complex systems.

A possible solution to these issues is multilevel simulation. This kind of simulation aims at dynamically adapting the level of entities' behaviors (microscopic, macroscopic) while being as faithful as possible to the simulated model. We propose a holonic organizational multilevel model for real-time simulation of complex systems by exploiting the hierarchical and distributed properties of the holarchies. To fully exploit this model, we estimate the deviation of simulation accuracy between two adjacent levels through physics-based indicators. These indicators will then allow us to dynamically determine the most suitable level for each entity in the application to maintain the best compromise between simulation accuracy and available resources. Finally a D real-time multilevel simulation of pedestrians is presented as well as a discussion of experimental results.|Nicolas Gaud,Franck Gechter,Stéphane Galland,Abder Koukam"],["16422|IJCAI|2007|Graph Connectivity Measures for Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation|Word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been a long-standing research objective for natural language processing.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16177|IJCAI|2005|Redundancy-free Island Parsing of Word Graphs|Island parsing is a bidirectional parsing strategy mostly used in speech analysis, as well as in applications where robustness is highly relevant andor processing resources are limited.

Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes.

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution. Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach.

A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation (WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of Vs and Ns in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP, NP - P - NP.

We start from descriptions of web services in standard process modeling and execution languages, like BPELWS, and automatically translate them into a planning domain that models the interactions among services at the knowledge level. This allows us to avoid the explosion of the search space due to the usually large and possibly infinite ranges of data values that are exchanged among services, and thus to scale up the applicability of state-of-the-art techniques for the automated composition of web services.

Two probabilistic models are developed, which differ in the interpretation of the query-document co-occurrences.

In this paper, we propose a unified approach to these two problems that dynamically models the objects to be manipulated and localizes the robot at the same time. Our approach applies in the common setting where only a lowresolution (cm) grid-map of a building is available, but we also have a high-resolution (.cm) model of the object to be manipulated. Our method is based on defining a unifying probabilistic model over these two representations. The resulting algorithm works in real-time, and estimates the position of objects with sufficient precision for manipulation tasks. We apply our approach to the task of navigating from one office to another (including manipulating doors). Our approach, successfully tested on multiple doors, allows the robot to navigate through a hallway to an office door, grasp and turn the door handle, and continuously manipulate the door as it moves into the office.|Anna Petrovskaya,Andrew Y.

For ambiguous queries, a traditional approach is to organize search results into groups (clusters), one for each meaning of the query. These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate. Combined with a content-driven Web page clustering technique, our heuristic search system significantly improves the clustering results.|Ron Bekkerman,Shlomo Zilberstein,James Allan","16487|IJCAI|2007|A New Approach for Stereo Matching in Autonomous Mobile Robot Applications|We propose a new approach for stereo matching in Autonomous Mobile Robot applications. In this framework an accurate but slow reconstruction of the D scene is not needed rather, it is more important to have a fast localization of the obstacles to avoid them. All the methods in the literature are based on a punctual correspondence, but they are inefficient in realistic contexts for the presence of uniform patterns, or some perturbations between the two images of the stereo pair. Our idea is to face the stereo matching problem as a matching between homologous regions, instead of a point matching. The stereo images are represented as graphs and a graph matching is computed to find homologous regions. We present some results on a standard stereo database and also on a more realistic stereo sequence acquired from a robot moving in an indoor environment, and a performance comparison with other approaches in the literature is reported and discussed. Our method is strongly robust in case of some fluctuations of the stereo pair, homogeneous and repetitive regions, and is fast. The result is a semi-dense disparity map, leaving only a few regions in the scene unmatched.|Pasquale Foggia,Jean-Michel Jolion,Alessandro Limongiello,Mario Vento","16300|IJCAI|2005|A Live-User Evaluation of Collaborative Web Search|Collaborative Web search exploits repetition and regularity within the query-space of a community of like-minded individuals in order to improve the quality of search results.

Then, images related to the query are identified by analyzing the density of the visual feature space.

We not only show that such fragments can be decided, tractably, via clausal temporal resolution, but also show the benefits of combining multiple XOR fragments. For such combinations we establish completeness and complexity (of the resolution method), and also describe how such a temporal language might be used in application areas, for example the verification of multi-agent systems.

However, there are also numerous monocular visual cues--such as texture variations and gradients, defocus, colorhaze, etc. --that have heretofore been little exploited in such systems. Some of these cues apply even in regions without texture, where stereo would work poorly. In this paper, we apply a Markov Random Field (MRF) learning algorithm to capture some of these monocular cues, and incorporate them into a stereo system. We show that by adding monocular cues to stereo (triangulation) ones, we obtain significantly more accurate depth estimates than is possible using either monocular or stereo cues alone. This holds true for a large variety of environments, including both indoor environments and unstructured outdoor environments containing treesforests, buildings, etc. Our approach is general, and applies to incorporating monocular cues together with any off-the-shelf stereo system.|Ashutosh Saxena,Jamie Schulte,Andrew Y.

The vast majority of this work has assumed that negotiation issues are independent, so agents can aggregate the utilities of the issue values by simple summation, producing linear utility functions. In the real world, however, such aggregations are often unrealistic. We cannot, for example, just add up the value of car's carburetor and the value of car's engine when engineers negotiate over the design a car. These value of these choices are interdependent, resulting in nonlinear utility functions. In this paper, we address this important gap in current negotiation techniques. We propose a negotiation protocol where agents employ adjusted sampling to generate proposals, and a bidding-based mechanism is used to find social-welfare maximizing deals. Our experimental results show that our method substantially outperforms existing methods in large non-linear utility spaces like those found in real world contexts.|Takayuki Ito,Hiromitsu Hattori,Mark Klein","16029|IJCAI|2005|Exploiting Informative Priors for Bayesian Classification and Regression Trees|A general method for defining informative priors on statistical models is presented and applied specifically to the space of classification and regression trees.

Coarse-grained arc consistency algorithms like AC-, AC-d and AC- are efficient when it comes to transforming a CSP to its arc-consistent equivalent. These algorithms repeatedly carry out revisions. Revisions require support checks for identifying and deleting all unsupported values from the domain of a variable. In revisions for difficult problems most values have some support. Indeed, most revisions are ineffective, i.e. they cannot delete any value and consume a lot of checks and time. We propose two solutions to overcome these problems. First we introduce the notion of a Support Condition (SC) which guarantees that a value has some support. SCs reduce support checks while maintaining arc consistency during search. Second we introduce the notion of a Revision Condition (RC) which guarantees that all values have support. A RC avoids a candidate revision and queue maintenance overhead. For random problems, SCs reduce the checks required by MAC- (MAC-) up to % (%). RCs avoid at least % of the total revisions.

In practice this may be highly inappropriate since it ignores errors in the models and the varying dynamics of the processes. This work presents a self adaptive version of the particle filter that uses statistical methods to adapt the number of particles and the propagation function at each iteration. Furthermore, our method presents similar computational load than the standard particle filter.

Although much effort has been made to design efficient standalone AC algorithms, there is no systematic study on how to efficiently enforce AC during search, as far as we know. The significance of the latter is clear given the fact that AC will be enforced millions of times in solving hard problems. In this paper, we propose a framework for enforcing AC during search (ACS) and complexity measurements of ACS algorithms. Based on this framework, several ACS algorithms are designed to take advantage of the residual data left in the data structures by the previous invocation(s) of ACS. The algorithms vary in the worst-case time and space complexity and other complexity measurements. Empirical study shows that some of the new ACS algorithms perform better than the conventional implementation of AC algorithms in a search procedure.|Chavalit Likitvivatanavong,Yuanlin Zhang,Scott Shannon,James Bowen,Eugene C.

This knowledge is represented using publicly available ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, such as the Open Directory these ontologies are further enriched by several orders of magnitude through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the documents alone.

Beyond these pragmatic benefits, the alignment problem is appealing from a modeling perspective the mappings between database entries and text sentences exhibit rich structural dependencies, unique to this task. Thus, the key challenge is to make use of as many global dependencies as possible without sacrificing tractability. To this end, we cast text-database alignment as a structured multilabel classification task where each sentence is labeled with a subset of matching database entries. In contrast to existing multilabel classifiers, our approach operates over arbitrary global features of inputs and proposed labels.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16301|IJCAI|2005|SVM-based Obstacles Recognition for Road Vehicle Applications|This paper describes an obstacle Recognition System based on SVM and vision.

We model the problem as an assistant POMDP where the hidden state corresponds to the agent's unobserved goals. This formulation allows us to exploit domain models for both estimating the agent's goals and selecting assistive action. In addition, the formulation naturally handles uncertainty, varying action costs, and customization to specific agents via learning. We argue that in many domains myopic heuristics will be adequate for selecting actions in the assistant POMDP and present two such heuristics.

This is particularly true for massive datasets and learning algorithms with worse than linear scaling factors. Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are among the top performers in the text classification domain and often work best with very rich feature representations. Even they however benefit from reducing the number of features, sometimes to a large extent. In this work we propose alternatives to exact re-induction of SVM models during the search for the optimum feature subset. The approximations offer substantial benefits in terms of computational efficiency. We are able to demonstrate that no significant compromises in terms of model quality are made and, moreover, in some cases gains in accuracy can be achieved.|Aleksander Kolcz,Abdur Chowdhury","16646|IJCAI|2007|Feature Based Occupancy Grid Maps for Sonar Based Safe-Mapping|This paper presents a methodology for integrating features within the occupancy grid (OG) framework. The OG maps provide a dense representation of the environment. In particular they give information for every range measurement projected onto a grid. However independence assumptions between cells during updates as well as not considering sonar models lead to inconsistent maps, which may also lead the robot to take some decisions which may be unsafe or which may introduce an unnecessary overhead of run-time collision avoidance behaviors. Feature based maps provide more consistent representation by implicitly considering correlation between cells. But they are sparse due to sparseness of features in a typical environment. This paper provides a method for integrating feature based representations within the standard Bayesian framework of OG and provides a dense, more accurate and safe representation than standard OG methods.|Amit Kumar Pandey,K.

When it comes to solving a new problem, each of these cases serves as an individual piece of evidence that gives an indication of the solution to that problem. In this paper, we elaborate on issues concerning the proper combination (aggregation) of such pieces of evidence. Particularly, we argue that cases retrieved from a case library must not be considered as independent information sources, as implicitly done by most case-based learning methods. Focusing on the problem of prediction as a performance task, we propose a new inference principle that combines potentially interacting pieces of evidence by means of the so-called (discrete) Choquet-integral. Our method, called Cho-k-NN, takes interdependencies between the stored cases into account and can be seen as a generalization of weighted nearest neighbor estimation.|Eyke Hüllermeier","16253|IJCAI|2005|ROCCER An Algorithm for Rule Learning Based on ROC Analysis|We introduce a rule selection algorithm called ROCCER, which operates by selecting classification rules from a larger set of rules - for instance found by Apriori - using ROC analysis.

Good high-level features are those that concentrate information about the classification task. Such features can often be constructed as non-linear combinations of raw or native input features such as the pixels of an image. Using many nonlinear combinations, as do SVMs, can dilute the classification information necessitating many training examples. On the other hand, searching even a modestly-expressive space of nonlinear functions for high-information ones can be intractable. We describe an approach to feature construction where task-relevant discriminative features are automatically constructed, guided by an explanation-based interaction of training examples and prior domain knowledge. We show that in the challenging task of distinguishing handwritten Chinese characters, our automatic feature-construction approach performs particularly well on the most difficult and complex character pairs.|Shiau Hong Lim,Li-Lun Wang,Gerald DeJong","16262|IJCAI|2005|InterActive Feature Selection|We study the effects of feature selection and human feedback on features in active learning settings.

Consistent with previous findings, we find that feature selection based on the labeled training set has little effect. But our experiments on human subjects indicate that human feedback on feature relevance can identify a sufficient proportion (%) of the most relevant features. Furthermore, these experiments show that feature labeling takes much less (about th) time than document labeling.

Therefore, irrelevant features might hurt retrieval performance. Probabilistic approaches have proven to be an effective solution to this CBIR problem. In this paper, we use a Bayesian logistic regression model, in order to compute the weights of a pseudo-metric to improve its discriminatory capacity and then to increase image retrieval accuracy. The pseudo-metric weights were adjusted by the classical logistic regression model in Ksantini et al., . The Bayesian logistic regression model was shown to be a significantly better tool than the classical logistic regression one to improve the retrieval performance.

Among different approaches to ensemble feature selection, genetic search was shown to perform best in many domains. In this paper, a new strategy GAS-SEFS, Genetic Algorithmbased Sequential Search for Ensemble Feature Selection, is introduced. Instead of one genetic process, it employs a series of processes, the goal of each of which is to build one base classifier. Experiments on  data sets are conducted, comparing the new strategy with a previously considered genetic strategy for different ensemble sizes and for five different ensemble integration methods. The experiments show that GAS-SEFS, although being more time-consuming, often builds better ensembles, especially on data sets with larger numbers of features.|Alexey Tsymbal,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Padraig Cunningham","16386|IJCAI|2007|Feature Selection and Kernel Design via Linear Programming|The definition of object (e.g., data point) similarity is critical to the performance of many machine learning algorithms, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. However, it is often the case that a similarity function is unknown or chosen by hand. This paper introduces a formulation that given relative similarity comparisons among triples of points of the form object i is more like object j than object k, it constructs a kernel function that preserves the given relationships. Our approach is based on learning a kernel that is a combination of functions taken from a set of base functions (these could be kernels as well). The formulation is based on defining an optimization problem that can be solved using linear programming instead of a semidefinite program usually required for kernel learning. We show how to construct a convex problem from the given set of similarity comparisons and then arrive to a linear programming formulation by employing a subset of the positive definite matrices. We extend this formulation to consider representationevaluation efficiency based on formulating a novel form of feature selection using kernels (that is not much more expensive to solve). Using publicly available data, we experimentally demonstrate how the formulation introduced in this paper shows excellent performance in practice by comparing it with a baseline method and a related state-of-the art approach, in addition of being much more efficient computationally.|Glenn Fung,Rómer Rosales,R.

Given the pattern V -NP-P-NP in the text, where V is verb, NP is a noun phrase, P is the preposition and NP is the other noun phrase, the question asked is where does P - NP attach V or NP This question is typically answered using both the word and the world knowledge. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution. Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach. The unambiguous V - P - N and N - P -N tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N - P - N tuples of the test corpus. A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation (WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of Vs and Ns in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP, NP - P - NP. For experimentation, Brown Corpus provides the training data andWall Street Journal Corpus the test data. The accuracy obtained for PP-attachment resolution is close to %.

However, since LSI ignores class labels of training documents, LSI generated representations are not as effective in classification tasks. To address this limitation, a process called 'sprinkling' is presented. Sprinkling is a simple extension of LSI based on augmenting the set of features using additional terms that encode class knowledge. However, a limitation of sprinkling is that it treats all classes (and classifiers) in the same way. To overcome this, we propose a more principled extension called Adaptive Sprinkling (AS). AS leverages confusion matrices to emphasise the differences between those classes which are hard to separate. The method is tested on diverse classification tasks, including those where classes share ordinal or hierarchical relationships. These experiments reveal that AS can significantly enhance the performance of instance-based techniques (kNN) to make them competitive with the state-of-the-art SVM classifier. The revised representations generated by AS also have a favourable impact on SVM performance.|Sutanu Chakraborti,Rahman Mukras,Robert Lothian,Nirmalie Wiratunga,Stuart N. K. Watt,David J.

However, when the objects to compare are semantically defined, like ontologies and alignments, it can happen that a fully correct alignment has low precision. This is due to the restricted set-theoretic foundation of these measures.

Of particular interest is the way in which new beliefs are acquired and determined and old beliefs are retained or discarded.

The RTDP algorithm solves the reduced model, while working with parameters of the original model and the given symmetries. As RTDP uses its experience to determine which states to backup, it focuses on parts of the reduced state set that are most relevant. This results in significantly faster learning and a reduced overall execution time.

Furthermore, in order to apply NML in practice, one often needs to compute a whole table of these exponential sums. In our previous work, we were able to compute this table by a recursive algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to significantly improve the time complexity of this algorithm. The techniques used here are based on the discrete Fourier transformand the convolution theorem.|Petri Kontkanen,Petri Myllymäki","16629|IJCAI|2007|MB-DPOP A New Memory-Bounded Algorithm for Distributed Optimization|In distributed combinatorial optimization problems, dynamic programming algorithms like DPOP (Petcu and Faltings, ) require only a linear number of messages, thus generating low communication overheads. However, DPOP's memory requirements are exponential in the induced width of the constraint graph, which may be prohibitive for problems with large width. We present MB-DPOP, a new hybrid algorithm that can operate with bounded memory. In areas of low width, MB-DPOP operates like standard DPOP (linear number of messages). Areas of high width are explored with bounded propagations using the idea of cycle-cuts Dechter, . We introduce novel DFS-based mechanisms for determining the cycle-cutset, and for grouping cycle-cut nodes into clusters. We use caching (Darwiche, ) between clusters to reduce the complexity to exponential in the largest number of cycle cuts in a single cluster.

However, in these similarity measures no assumption is made about the probability distributions and the local relevances of the feature vectors. Therefore, irrelevant features might hurt retrieval performance. Probabilistic approaches have proven to be an effective solution to this CBIR problem. In this paper, we use a Bayesian logistic regression model, in order to compute the weights of a pseudo-metric to improve its discriminatory capacity and then to increase image retrieval accuracy. The pseudo-metric weights were adjusted by the classical logistic regression model in Ksantini et al., . The Bayesian logistic regression model was shown to be a significantly better tool than the classical logistic regression one to improve the retrieval performance. The retrieval method is fast and is based on feature selection.

Our methods apply to hybrid systems containing both discrete and continuous variables. The dynamics of the discrete state system are governed by a Markov jump process. Observations of the discrete process are intermittent and irregular. Whenever the discrete process is observed, CTPF samples a trajectory of the underlying Markov jump process. This trajectory is then used to estimate the continuous variables using the system dynamics determined by the discrete state in the trajectory. We use the unscented Kalman-Bucy filter to handle nonlinearities and continuous time. We present results showing that CTPF is more stable in its performance than discrete-time particle filtering, even when the discrete-time algorithm is allowed to update many more times than CTPF.

In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model.

Finally, motivated by the hardness results, an island of tractability for CCSPs is identified, by extending structural decomposition methods originally proposed for CSPs.|Georg Gottlob,Gianluigi Greco,Toni Mancini"]]}}
