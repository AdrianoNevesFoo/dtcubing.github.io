The primary challenge in learning is scale. Since the model comprises roughly , irregularly connected nodes in each time slice, it is intractable either to completely label observed data manually or to compute the expected likelihood of even a single lime slice.

We engage in a detailed investigation of credit assignment in one recent system called UCS, and in the process uncover two previously undocumented features. We draw on techniques from the classical pattern recognition literature, showing how to analytically derive an optimal credit assignment system, given certain assumptions. Our primary aim is not to improve accuracy, but to better understand the system and put it on a more solid theoreticalfoundation. Nonetheless, empirical results on benign data demonstrate our new system, called UCSpv (UCS with principled voting), can match or exceed the original UCS. Further, its fitness function is principled, and, unlike that of UCS, requires no tuning. However, on more difficult data it seems UCSpv does need some form of tuning or correction.

Artificial intelligence uses modal logics most heavily to represent and reason about knowledge of agents about others' knowledge.

In this paper we provide a formal system that represents probabilistic knowledge about probabilistic knowledge. We also present exact and approximate algorithms for reasoning about the truth value of queries that are encoded as probabilistic modal logic formulas. We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model. Then, we introduce an approximate method for applications in which we have very many or infinitely many states.

The networks are relatively simple and can be used for reasoning about time and for learning by examples with the use of standard neural learning algorithms. We validate the model in a well-known application dealing WIth temporal synchronisation in distributed knowledge systems.

There is a distinction between factual and ontological knowledge. Factual knowledge represents a set of facts about individual objects that are known or believed whereas ontological (background) knowledge represents implicit concepts and relationships that are assumed to exist in the world. Ontological knowledge is often represented as a hierarchy of concepts because splitting things of the real world into categories and sub-categories is a natural way of human thinking. One example of conceptual hierarchies in AI is ontologies that are widely used in such areas as Natural Language Processing, Semantic Web, etc. Representation of both types of knowledge becomes difficult when the knowledge is imprecise. One example of imprecision is granularity i.e. inability to distinguish between the individual objects. In this case, knowledge cannot be represented precisely but can be approximated with respect to the granularity of the domain. Approximation of factual knowledge has been extensively researched and often employs Rough Set Theory (Pawlak ) for dealing with indiscernibility of objects. Similar approach has been applied to ontologies to approximate concepts in the hierarchy (Doherty et al. ). The open problem is the approximations of hierarchical relationships (such as \"is-a\", \"part-of') between concepts. This paper addresses this issue using Rough Mereology (Polkowski & Skowron ) complemented with Interval Analysis (Moore ). The principal contribution is to provide rough mereological functions that can be used for representation and reasoning with formal ontologies in approximation spaces. Specifically, approximate concept membership and approximate concept subsumption functions will be provided. It can be demonstrated that the interval based functions are free of the shortcomings of the previously suggested definitions (Cao, Sui, & Zhang ) (Klinov & Mazlack ).|Pavel Klinov,Lawrence J.

Given such weak supervision, our approach produces a semantic parser that maps sentences into meaning representations. An existing semantic parsing learning system that can only learn from unambiguous supervision is augmented to handle ambiguous supervision. Experimental results show that the resulting system is able to cope up with ambiguities and learn accurate semantic parsers.|Rohit J. Kate,Raymond J.

They are an extension of MDPs that provide variety of experience during repeated execution. Here, we present a brief overview of TTD-MDPs with approaches for constructing target distributions.

First, it calls attention to the possibility of studying belief spaces in way that generalizes both probabilistic and nondeterministic uncertainty models.

In high energy physics, AI methods can aid precision measurements that elucidate the underlying structure of matter, such as measurements of the mass of the top quark. Top quarks can be produced only in collisions at high energy particle accelerators. Most collisions, however, do not produce top quarks and making precise measurements requires culling these collisions into a sample that is rich in collisions producing top quarks (signal) and spare in collisions producing other particles (background). Collision selection is typically performed with heuristics or supervised learning methods. However, such approaches are suboptimal because they assume that the selector with the highest classification accuracy will yield a mass measurement with the smallest statistical uncertainty. In practice, however, the mass measurement is more sensitive to some backgrounds than others. This paper presents a new approach that uses stochastic optimization techniques to directly search for selectors that minimize statistical uncertainty in the top quark mass measurement. Empirical results confirm that stochastically optimized selectors have much smaller uncertainty. This new approach contributes substantially to our knowledge of the top quark's mass, as the new selectors are currently in use selecting real collisions.|Shimon Whiteson,Daniel Whiteson","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world. The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","66010|AAAI|2007|A Unification of Extensive-Form Games and Markov Decision Processes|We describe a generalization of extensive-form games that greatly increases representational power while still allowing efficient computation in the zero-sum setting.

This paper analyzes probabilistic models in hBOA on two common test problems concatenated traps and D Ising spin glasses with periodic boundary conditions. We argue that although Bayesian networks with local structures can encode complex probability distributions, analyzing these models in hBOA is relatively straightforward and the results of such analyses may provide practitioners with useful information about their problems. The results show that the probabilistic models in hBOA closely correspond to the structure of the underlying optimization problem, the models do not change significantly in subsequent iterations of BOA, and creating adequate probabilistic models by hand is not straightforward even with complete knowledge of the optimization problem.|Mark Hauschild,Martin Pelikan,Cl√°udio F.

Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme.

For these kernel functions, evolutionary SVM even outperform other learning methods like the Relevance Vector Machine. In this paper, we will discuss another major advantage of evolutionary SVM compared to traditional SVM solutions we can explicitly optimize the inherent trade-off between training error and model complexity by embedding multi-objective optimization into the evolutionary SVM. This leads to three advantages first, it is no longer necessary to tune the SVM parameter C which weighs both conflicting criteria. This is a very time-consuming task for traditional SVM.

The agents are controlled by a new kind of computational network based on a compartmentalised model of neurons. We have taken the view that the genetic basis of neurons is an important  and neglected aspect of previous approaches. Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents.

First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only (Off-EEL) or incrementally along evolution (On-EEL).

They allow a system to take advantage of prior domain knowledge supplied either by a human user or another algorithm, combining that knowledge with data to produce accurate models. A limitation of the use of prior knowledge occurs when the provided knowledge is incorrect. Such knowledge likely still contains useful information, but knowledge-based learners might not be able to fully exploit such information. In fact, incorrect knowledge can lead to poorer models than result from knowledge-free learners.

If the space of parameters is continuous, then we can regard it as a manifold. In practice, we usually do not know this manifold but we just have some representation of the data, often in a very high-dimensional feature space. Since the number of internal parameters does not change with the representation, the data will effectively lie on a low-dimensional submanifold in feature space. However, the data is usually corrupted by noise, which particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces makes it almost impossible to find the manifold structure. This paper reviews a method called Manifold Denoising, which projects the data onto the submanifold using a diffusion process on a graph generated by the data.

Implicit encoding makes the search more efficient and uses several times fewer parameters. Random mutation leads to highly structured phenotypic variation that is acquired during the course of evolution rather than built into the representation itself. Thus, adaptive representations learn to become evolvable, and furthermore do so in a way that makes search efficient on difficult coevolutionary problems.|Joseph Reisinger,Risto Miikkulainen","58143|GECCO|2007|Parsimonious regularization using genetic algorithms applied to the analysis of analytical ultracentrifugation experiments|Frequently in the physical sciences experimental data are analyzed to determine model parameters using techniques known as parameter estimation.

However, as we begin creating autonomous agents to operate in the rich environments of modern videogames and computer simulations, it becomes important to devise agent behaviors that display the visible attributes of intelligence, rather than simply performing optimally. Such visibly intelligent behavior is difficult to specify with rules or characterize in terms of quantifiable objective functions, but it is possible to utilize human intuitions to directly guide a learning system toward the desired sorts of behavior. Policy induction from human-generated examples is a promising approach to training such agents. In this paper, such a method is developed and tested using Lamarckian neuroevolution. Artificial neural networks are evolved to control autonomous agents in a strategy game.

Approximation has been identified as a potential way to reduce the complexity of query answering over OWL DL ontologies. Existing approaches are mainly based on syntactic approximation of ontological axioms and queries.

We identify a useful category of queries for which our approach guarantees also completeness.

A seminal contribution in this area is the V-detectors algorithm that can very effectively cover the nonself region of the feature space with a set of detectors. The detector set can be used to detect anomalous inputs. In this paper, a multistage approach to create an effective set of V-detectors is considered. The first stage of the algorithm generates an initial set of V-detectors. In subsequent stage, new detectors are grown from existing ones, by means of a mechanism called procreation. Procreating detectors can more effectively fill hard-to-reach interstices in the nonself region, resulting in better coverage. The effectiveness of the algorithm is first illustrated by applying it to a well-known fractal, the Koch curve. The algorithm is then applied to the problem of detecting anomalous behavior in power distribution systems, and can be of much use for maintenance-related decision-making in electrical utility companies.|Min Gui,Sanjoy Das,Anil Pahwa","58183|GECCO|2007|Keyword extraction using an artificial immune system|This paper presents a model for keyword extraction which combines an artificial immune system with a mathematical background based on information theory.

The latter is difficult because of high dimensionality, absence of overall smoothness, and a large number of local minima. In such a situation application of a genetic algorithm (GA) seems reasonable. A favorable assessment of application of GAs in MDS in previous publications is based on heuristic arguments without estimating quantitatively the precision of GA while applied to the solution of corresponding global optimization problems. Indeed, the estimation of precision is difficult because of complexity to find the actual global minimum not only in routine use but also in unique research experiments. Quantitatively the precision of GA was estimated, at least in the experimental problems of modest dimensionality, using global minima found by means of the developed parallel version of explicit enumeration algorithm. To cope with high complexity of the minimization problem a parallel version of GA is developed, and its efficiency for problem of higher dimensionality is investigated.|Antanas Zilinskas,Julius Zilinskas","58166|GECCO|2007|Hardware acceleration of multi-deme genetic algorithm for the application of DNA codeword searching|A large and reliable DNA codeword library is key to the success of DNA based computing.

A single supplier produces several items on a flexible flow line (FFL) production system and delivers them directly to an assembly facility. Based on the well-known basic period (BP) policy, a new mixed zero-one nonlinear programming model has been developed to minimize average setup, inventory-holding and delivery costs per unit time in the supply chain without any stock-out. The problem is very complex and it could not be solved to optimality especially in real-sized problems. So, an efficient hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) using the most applied BP approach (i.e. power-of-two policy) has been proposed. The solution quality of the proposed algorithm called PT-HGA has been evaluated and compared with the common cycle approach in some problem instances. Numerical experiments demonstrate the merit of the PT-HGA and indicate that it is a very promising solution method for the problem.|Masoud Jenabi,S. Ali Torabi,S.

For many problems, the larger the population size and the longer the genetic programming run the more likely the system is to find a solution. In order to increase the probability of success on difficult problems, designers and users of genetic programming systems often desire access to distributed computation, either locally or across the internet, to evaluate fitness cases more quickly. Most systems for internet-scale distributed computation require a user's explicit participation and the installation of client side software. We present a proof-of-concept system for distributed computation of genetic programming via asynchronous javascript and XML (AJAX) techniques which requires no explicit user interaction and no installation of client side software. Clients automatically and possibly even unknowingly participate in a distributed genetic programming system simply by visiting a webpage, thereby allowing for the solution of genetic programming problems without running a single local fitness evaluation. The system can be easily introduced into existing webpages to exploit unused client-side computation for the solution of genetic programming and other problems.|Jon Klein,Lee Spector","58052|GECCO|2007|Hybrid multiobjective optimization genetic algorithms for graph drawing|In this paper we introduce an application of multiobjective optimization with genetic algorithms to the problem of graph drawing and explore the potential contribution of the genetic algorithms for this particular problem.|Dana Vrajitoru","58107|GECCO|2007|Strengths and weaknesses of FSA representation|Genetic Programming and Evolutionary Programming are fields studying the application of artificial evolutionon evolving directly executable programs, in form of trees similar to Lisp expressions (GP-trees), or Finite State Automata (FSA).In this exercise, we study the performance of these methods on several example problems, and draw conclusionson the suitability of the representations with respect to the task structure and properties.

We propose a method that uses chain structures as a model for Bayesian networks that can be constructed from given node orderings. The chain model is used to evolve a small number of orderings which are then injected into a greedy search phase which searches for an optimal structure.

However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method. In addition to that, the threshold ai is also evolved by mutation between i - aisi, i + aisi in every generation in order to obtain as many association rules as possible. The features of the proposed method are as follows compared with other methods ) Extracts rules without identifying frequent itemsets used in Apriori-like mining methods. ) Stores extracted important association rules in a pool all together through generations. ) Measures the significance of associations via the chi-squared test. ) Extracts important rules sufficient enough for user's purpose in a short time. ) The pool is updated in every generation and only important association rules with higher chi-squared value are stored when the identical rules are stored. We have evaluated the proposed method by doing two simulations. Simulation  uses fixed threshold values that is, they remain fixed at initial thresholds during evolution. In simulation ,thresholds are evolved by mutation in every generation. Fig.  shows the number of rules extracted in the pool in simulation . It is found that the number of rules extracted has been increased, which means simulation  outperforms simulation .|Karla Taboada,Kaoru Shimada,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","57965|GECCO|2007|Effects of passengers arrival distribution to double-deck elevator group supervisory control systems using genetic network programming|The Elevator Group Supervisory Control Systems (EGSCS) are the control systems that systematically manage three or more elevators in order to efficiently transport the passengers in buildings. Double-deck elevators, where two cages are connected with each other, are expected to be the next generation elevator systems. Meanwhile, Destination Floor Guidance Systems (DFGS) are also expected in Double-Deck Elevator Systems (DDES). With these, the passengers could be served at two consecutive floors and could input their destinations at elevator halls instead of conventional systems without DFGS. Such systems become more complex than the traditional systems and require new control methods Genetic Network Programming (GNP), a graph-based evolutionary method, has been applied to EGSCS and its advantages are shown in some previous papers. GNP can obtain the strategy of a new hall call assignment to the optimal elevator because it performs crossover and mutation operations to judgment nodes and processing nodes. In studies so far, the passenger's arrival has been assumed to take Exponential distribution for many years. In this paper, we have applied Erlang distribution and Binomial distribution in order to study how the passenger's arrival distribution affects EGSCS. We have found that the passenger's arrival distribution has great influence on EGSCS.

GNP is an evolutionary computation, which represents its solutions using graph structures and has some useful features inherently. It has been clarified that GNP works well especially in dynamic environments since GNP can create quite compact programs and has an implicit memory function. In this paper, GNP is applied to creating a stock trading model. There are three important points The first important point is to combine GNP with Sarsa Learning which is one of the reinforcement learning algorithms. Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of  brands in ,  and . Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in . From the simulation results, it is clarified that the trading rules of the proposed method obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method and its effectiveness has been confirmed.|Yan Chen,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","57881|GECCO|2007|Evolution of non-uniform cellular automata using a genetic algorithm diversity and computation|We used a genetic algorithm to evaluate the cost  benefit of diversity in evolving sets of rules for non-uniform cellular automata solving the density classification problem.|Forrest Sondahl,William Rand","57910|GECCO|2007|A genetic algorithm for resident physician scheduling problem|This paper formally presents the resident physician scheduling problem, which is one of the most important scheduling problems in hospital.

When the decision maker wants to choose the most adequate strategy for its environment, there is a need to control the proposed evolutionary solving approach, due to the complexity of the model.

Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme.

In addition to a high resilience against such errors, diagnostic models need to be more comprehensible so that a deeper understanding of the causal interactions among biological entities like genes and proteins may be possible. In this paper, we introduce a robust knowledge discovery approach that addresses these challenges. First, the causal interactions among the genes and proteins in the noisy expression data are discovered automatically through Bayesian network learning. Then, the diagnosis of a disease based on the network is performed using a novel error-handling procedure, which automatically identifies the noisy measurements and accounts for their uncertainties during diagnosis. An application to the problem of ovarian cancer detection shows that the approach effectively discovers causal interactions among cancer-specific proteins. With the proposed error-handling procedure, the network perfectly distinguishes between the cancer and normal patients.|Ghim-Eng Yap,Ah-Hwee Tan,HweeHwa Pang","58034|GECCO|2007|Clustering gene expression data via mining ensembles of classification rules evolved using moses|A novel approach, model-based clustering, is described foridentifying complex interactions between genes or gene-categories based on static gene expression data. The approach deals with categorical data, which consists of a set of gene expressionprofiles belonging to one category, and a set belonging to anothercategory. An evolutionary algorithm (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES) is used to learn an ensemble of classification models distinguishing the two categories, based on inputs that are features corresponding to gene expression values. Each feature is associated with a model-based vector, which encodes quantitative information regarding the utilization of the feature across the ensembles of models. Two different ways of constructing these vectors are explored. These model-based vectors are then clustered using a variant of hierarchical clustering called Omniclust. The result is a set of model-based clusters, in which features are gathered together if they are often considered together by classification models -- which may be because they're co-expressed, or may be for subtler reasons involving multi-gene interactions. The method is illustrated by applying it to two datasets regarding human gene expression, one drawn from brain cells and pertinent to the neurogenetics of aging, and the other drawn from blood cells and relating to differentiating between types of lymphoma. We find that, compared to traditional expression-based clustering, the new method often yields clusters that have higher mathematical quality (in the sense of homogeneity and separation) and also yield novel and meaningful insights into the underlying biological processes.|Moshe Looks,Ben Goertzel,L√∫cio de Souza Coelho,Mauricio Mudado,Cassio Pennachin","58223|GECCO|2007|Modelling danger and anergy in artificial immune systems|Artificial Immune Systems are engineering systems which have been inspired from the functioning of the biological immune system.

This paper presents a new modal logic formalizing agents' pro attitudes, based on neighborhood models. There are three distinguishing features of this logic. Firstly, this logic naturally satisfies Bratman's requirements for agents' beliefs and pro attitudes, as well as some interesting properties that have not been discussed before.

Artificial intelligence uses modal logics most heavily to represent and reason about knowledge of agents about others' knowledge. This type of reasoning occurs in dialog, collaboration, and competition. In many applications it is also important to be able to reason about the probability of beliefs and events. In this paper we provide a formal system that represents probabilistic knowledge about probabilistic knowledge. We also present exact and approximate algorithms for reasoning about the truth value of queries that are encoded as probabilistic modal logic formulas. We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model. Then, we introduce an approximate method for applications in which we have very many or infinitely many states. Exact methods are impractical in these applications and we show that our method returns a close estimate efficiently.|Afsaneh Shirazi,Eyal Amir","66144|AAAI|2007|Prime Implicates and Prime Implicants in Modal Logic|The purpose of this paper is to extend the notions of prime implicates and prime implicants to the basic modal logic .

Our first strategy uses additional binary variables for the CSP, and applies an XOR or parity constraint based method introduced previously for Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. In the CSP framework, in addition to the naive individual filtering of XOR constraints used in SAT, we are able to apply a global domain filtering algorithm by viewing these constraints as a collection of linear equalities over the field of two elements. Our most promising strategy extends this approach further to larger domains, and applies the so-called generalized XOR constraints directly to CSP variables. This allows us to reap the benefits of the compact and structured representation that CSPs offer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our counting framework through experimental comparisons with the solution enumeration approach (which, we believe, is the current best generic solution counting method for CSPs), and with solution counting in the context of SAT and integer programming.|Carla P.

Then the target population is recombined with the mutant population in order to generate a trial population. Finally, a selection operator is applied to both target and trial populations to determine who will survive for the next generation based on fitness evaluations. As a mutation operator in the discrete differential evolution algorithm, a destruction and construction procedure is employed to generate the mutant population. We propose a referenced local search, which is embedded in the discrete differential evolution algorithm to further improve the solution quality. Computational results show that the proposed DDE algorithm with the referenced local search is very competitive to the iterated greedy algorithm which is one of the best performing algorithms for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem in the literature.|Quan-Qe Pan,Mehmet Fatih Tasgetiren,Yun-Chia Liang","57881|GECCO|2007|Evolution of non-uniform cellular automata using a genetic algorithm diversity and computation|We used a genetic algorithm to evaluate the cost  benefit of diversity in evolving sets of rules for non-uniform cellular automata solving the density classification problem.|Forrest Sondahl,William Rand","57963|GECCO|2007|Graph structured program evolution|In recent years a lot of Automatic Programming techniques have developed.

The paper proposes a hill-climber operating over the building block (BB) space that can efficiently address hierarchical problems. The new Building Block Hill-Climber (BBHC) uses hill-climb search experience to learn the problem structure. The neighborhood structure is adapted whenever new knowledge about the underlaying BB structure is incorporated into the search. This allows the method to climb the hierarchical structure by revealing and solving consecutively the hierarchical levels. It is expected that for fully non-deceptive hierarchical BB structures the BBHC can solve hierarchical problems in linearithmic time. Empirical results confirm that the proposed method scales almost linearly with the problem size thus clearly outperforms population based recombinative methods.|David Iclanzan,Dan Dumitrescu","57991|GECCO|2007|A building-block royal road where crossover is provably essential|One of the most controversial yet enduring hypotheses about what genetic algorithms (GAs) are good for concerns the idea that GAs process building-blocks.

The latter is difficult because of high dimensionality, absence of overall smoothness, and a large number of local minima. In such a situation application of a genetic algorithm (GA) seems reasonable. A favorable assessment of application of GAs in MDS in previous publications is based on heuristic arguments without estimating quantitatively the precision of GA while applied to the solution of corresponding global optimization problems. Indeed, the estimation of precision is difficult because of complexity to find the actual global minimum not only in routine use but also in unique research experiments. Quantitatively the precision of GA was estimated, at least in the experimental problems of modest dimensionality, using global minima found by means of the developed parallel version of explicit enumeration algorithm.

The simulation results suggest that the proposed detector gives an acceptable performance complexity trade-off in comparison with ML and VBLAST detector.|Adnan Ahmed Khan,Muhammad Naeem,Syed Ismail Shah","58033|GECCO|2007|Collective specialization in multi-rover systems|Neuro-Evolution (NE) methods have been successfully applied to the rover task domain , . However, extending this domain to include the notion of using NE to facilitate emergent specialization, in order to increase task performance, has not yet been investigated. We introduce the Collective Neuro Evolution (CONE) method, and compares its efficacy for designing specialization, with a conventional NE method. CONE and conventional NE were applied to an extension of the multi-rover task ,  for the purpose of designing collective behavior. This task requires solutions for controlling groups of simulated autonomous vehicles (rovers) that seek to maximize the number of points of interest discovered in an unexplored environment (global evaluation function). Rovers operated in a discrete simulation environment, and used complementary sensors and actuators so as to maximize the global evaluation function. Specialization was defined at both the individual and group level according to the frequency with which rover sensors and actuators were activated. An individual rover was defi ned as being specialized if a given action was executed for the majority ( %) of a rovers lifetime. Likewise, a rover group was defined as being specialized if rovers with a given individual specialization constituted the majority ( %) of rovers in a group. Emergent specialization, facilitated by the NE methods was measured at both the individual and rover group level. At any simulation time step, a rover could execute one action, which equated to using one of two sensor types (detection or evaluation), or one of two actuator types (movement or communication). If a rover spent the majority of its lifetime executing a single action, it would be labeled as an evaluator, detector, communicator, or mover. Likewise, rover groups were defined as evaluator, detector, communicator, or mover groups if a majority of the group consisted of rovers with a given individual specialization. A rover domain performance benchmark was defined via specifying individual rover specialization a priori. The REVAC parameter calibration method  used to evolve a non-specialized rover group with a high task performance. One contribution was the provision of the CONE method, which facilitated emergent specialization, at both the individual agent and group level, so as to increase group fitness in collective behavior tasks. Previous research elucidated that behavioral specialization, at both the individual and group level, is beneficial for task performance . Here, the research hypothesis was that CONE is appropriate for deriving specialization at both the individual (rover controller), and at the group (composition of specialized rover controllers), where such specialization results in a high group fitness (performance). To test this hypothesis, the task performance and emergent specialization observed using the CONE method was compared to that of the conventional NE method, as well as a non-adaptive heuristic controller method. For both NE methods, each rover maintained and evolved its own population of genotypes. CONE evolved populations of neurons, from which complete neural network controllers were constructed, where as, the conventional NE method evolved populations of complete controllers. Results indicate that the CONE method was appropriate for facilitating specialization at both the individual and group levels, where as, the conventional NE method only facilitated individual specialization. An inferior performance was exhibited by rover groups controlled by the conventional NE method, and by non-specialized rover groups using heuristic controllers. In both cases, this was theorized to be a consequence of a lack of group level specialization.|Geoff Nitschke,Martijn C. Schut,A. E.

However, most of these systems do not generally adapt to new circumstances, do not self-evaluate and self-configure their own strategies, and do not monitor the usage history of the learning content being delivered or presented to the students. These shortcomings force ITS developers to often spend much development time in manual revision and fine-tuning of the learning and instructional contents of an ITS. In this paper, we describe an intelligent agent that delivers learning material adaptively to different students, factoring in the usage history of the learning materials and student profiles as observed by the agent. Student-tutor interaction includes the activities of going through learning material, such as a topical tutorial, a set of examples, and a set of problems. Our assumption is that our agent will be able to capture and utilize these student activities as the primer to select the appropriate examples or problems to administer to the student. Using an integrated introspective case-based reasoning approach, our agent further learns from its experience and refines its reasoning process-including the instructional strategies-to adapt to student needs. Moreover, our agent monitors the usage history of the learning materials to improve its performance. We have built an end-to-end ITS using an agent powered by this integrated introspective case-based reasoning engine. We have deployed the ITS in a CS course. Results indicate that the ITS was able to learn to deliver more appropriate examples and problems to the students.|Leen-Kiat Soh","58017|GECCO|2007|Procreating V-detectors for nonself recognition an application to anomaly detection in power systems|The artificial immune system approach for self-nonself discrimination and its application to anomaly detection problems in engineering is showing great promise. A seminal contribution in this area is the V-detectors algorithm that can very effectively cover the nonself region of the feature space with a set of detectors. The detector set can be used to detect anomalous inputs. In this paper, a multistage approach to create an effective set of V-detectors is considered. The first stage of the algorithm generates an initial set of V-detectors. In subsequent stage, new detectors are grown from existing ones, by means of a mechanism called procreation. Procreating detectors can more effectively fill hard-to-reach interstices in the nonself region, resulting in better coverage. The effectiveness of the algorithm is first illustrated by applying it to a well-known fractal, the Koch curve. The algorithm is then applied to the problem of detecting anomalous behavior in power distribution systems, and can be of much use for maintenance-related decision-making in electrical utility companies.|Min Gui,Sanjoy Das,Anil Pahwa","58183|GECCO|2007|Keyword extraction using an artificial immune system|This paper presents a model for keyword extraction which combines an artificial immune system with a mathematical background based on information theory.

Both predicted and observed results show a distinct bias towards the sampling of shorter programs irrespective of the mix of function arities used. Practical applications and implications of this knowledge are investigated with regard to search efficiency and program bloat.

This paper aims to address these issues by introducing Enhanced Forma Analysis that explores a broader view of forma analysis by using ideas from constraint satisfaction.|Tao Gong,Andrew Tuson","58013|GECCO|2007|Analysis of evolutionary algorithms for the longest common subsequence problem|In the longest common subsequence problem the task is to find the longest sequence of letters that can be found as a subsequence in all members of a given finite set of sequences.

A phenomenon is discovered that current adaptive variance scaling method in EDA suffers from imprecise structure learning. A new type of adaptation method is proposed to overcome this defect. The method tries to measure the difference between the obtained population and the prediction of the probabilistic model, then calculate the scaling factor by minimizing the cross entropy between these two distributions. This approach calculates the scaling factor immediately rather than adapts it incrementally. Experiments show that this approach extended the class of problems that can be solved, and improve the search efficiency in some cases. Moreover, the proposed approach features in that each decomposed subspace can be assigned an individual scaling factor, which helps to solve problems with special dimension property.|Yunpeng Cai,Xiaomin Sun,Hua Xu,Peifa Jia","58070|GECCO|2007|Convergence phases variance trajectories and runtime analysis of continuous EDAs|Considering the available body of literature on continuous EDAs, one must state that many important questions are still unanswered, e.g. How do continuous EDAs really work, and how can we increase their efficiency further The first question must be answered on the basis of formal models, but despite some recent results, the majority of contributions to the field is experimental. The second questionshould be answered by exploiting the insights that have been gained from formal models. We contribute to the theoretical literature on continuous EDAs by focussing on a simple, yet important, question How should the variances used tosample offspring from change over an EDA run To answer this question, the convergence process is separated into three phases and it is shown that for each phase, a preferable strategy exists for setting the variances. It is highly likely that the use of variances that have been estimated with maximum likelihood is not optimal. Thus, variance modification policies are not just a nice add-on. In the light of our findings, they become an integral component of continuous EDAs, and they should consider the specific requirements of all phases of the optimization process.|J√∂rn Grahl,Peter A.

When doneproperly, such scaling has been shown to preventpremature convergence on slope-like regions ofthe search space. In this paper we specificallyfocus on one way of scaling that was previouslyintroduced as Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS). It wasfound that when using AVS, the average number offitness evaluations grows subquadratically withthe dimensionality on a wide range of unimodaltest-problems, competitively with the CMA-ES.Still, room for improvement exists because thevariance doesn't always have to be scaled. Apreviously introduced trigger based on correlationthat determines when to apply scaling was shownto fail on higher dimensional problems. Here weprovide a new solution called the Standard-DeviationRatio (SDR) trigger that is integrated with theIterated Density-Estimation Evolutionary Algorithm(IDEA). Intuitively put, scaling istriggered with SDR only if improvements are foundto be far away from the mean. SDR works even inhigh dimensions as a result of factorizing thedecision rule behind the trigger according to theestimated Bayesian factorization. We evaluateSDR-AVS-IDEA on the same set ofbenchmark problems and compare it with AVS-IDEAand CMA-ES. We find that the addition of SDR givesAVS-IDEA an important extra edgefor it to be used in future research and inapplications both in single-objective optimizationas well as in multi-objective and dynamicoptimization. In addition, we provide practical rulesof thumb for parameter settings for usingSDR-AVS-IDEA that result in anasymptotic scale-up behavior that is sublinearfor the population size (O(l.)) andsubquadratic (O(l.)) for thenumber of evaluations.|Peter A.

These results, however, apply particularly to classical search heuristics such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Simulated Annealing. First runtime analyses of modern search heuristics have been conducted only recently w.r.t a simple Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm called -ANT. In particular, the influence of the evaporation factor in the pheromone update mechanism and the robustness of this parameter w.r.t the runtime behavior have been determined for the example function OneMax.This paper puts forward the rigorous runtime analysis of the -ANT on example functions, namely on the functions LeadingOnes and BinVal. With respect to EAs, such analyses have been essential to develop methods for the analysis on more complicated problems. The proof techniques required for the -ANT, unfortunately, differ significantly from those for EAs, which means that a new reservoir of methods has to be built up. Again, the influence of the evaporation factor is analyzed rigorously, and it is proved that its choice can be very crucial to allow efficient runtimes. Moreover, the analyses provide insight into the working principles of ACO algorithms and, in terms of their robustness, describe essential differences to other randomized search heuristics.|Benjamin Doerr,Frank Neumann,Dirk Sudholt,Carsten Witt","58218|GECCO|2007|Adaptive variance scaling in continuous multi-objective estimation-of-distribution algorithms|Recent research into single-objective continuous Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs)has shown that when maximum-likelihood estimationsare used for parametric distributions such as thenormal distribution, the EDA can easily suffer frompremature convergence.

Experiments observe the response of populations in an environment where problem difficulty increases and decreases with varying frequency.

This task requires solutions for controlling groups of simulated autonomous vehicles (rovers) that seek to maximize the number of points of interest discovered in an unexplored environment (global evaluation function). Rovers operated in a discrete simulation environment, and used complementary sensors and actuators so as to maximize the global evaluation function. Specialization was defined at both the individual and group level according to the frequency with which rover sensors and actuators were activated. An individual rover was defi ned as being specialized if a given action was executed for the majority ( %) of a rovers lifetime. Likewise, a rover group was defined as being specialized if rovers with a given individual specialization constituted the majority ( %) of rovers in a group. Emergent specialization, facilitated by the NE methods was measured at both the individual and rover group level. At any simulation time step, a rover could execute one action, which equated to using one of two sensor types (detection or evaluation), or one of two actuator types (movement or communication). If a rover spent the majority of its lifetime executing a single action, it would be labeled as an evaluator, detector, communicator, or mover. Likewise, rover groups were defined as evaluator, detector, communicator, or mover groups if a majority of the group consisted of rovers with a given individual specialization. A rover domain performance benchmark was defined via specifying individual rover specialization a priori. The REVAC parameter calibration method  used to evolve a non-specialized rover group with a high task performance. One contribution was the provision of the CONE method, which facilitated emergent specialization, at both the individual agent and group level, so as to increase group fitness in collective behavior tasks. Previous research elucidated that behavioral specialization, at both the individual and group level, is beneficial for task performance . Here, the research hypothesis was that CONE is appropriate for deriving specialization at both the individual (rover controller), and at the group (composition of specialized rover controllers), where such specialization results in a high group fitness (performance). To test this hypothesis, the task performance and emergent specialization observed using the CONE method was compared to that of the conventional NE method, as well as a non-adaptive heuristic controller method. For both NE methods, each rover maintained and evolved its own population of genotypes. CONE evolved populations of neurons, from which complete neural network controllers were constructed, where as, the conventional NE method evolved populations of complete controllers. Results indicate that the CONE method was appropriate for facilitating specialization at both the individual and group levels, where as, the conventional NE method only facilitated individual specialization. An inferior performance was exhibited by rover groups controlled by the conventional NE method, and by non-specialized rover groups using heuristic controllers.

The aim is to manipulate the environment of the cells such that they display elementary learning, i.e., so that they respond to a given input signal in a pre-specified way. Results indicate that this is possible and that the learned stimulation protocols identify seemingly fundamental properties of in vitro neuronal networks.allUse of another learning scheme and simpler stimulation confirms these properties.|Larry Bull,Ivan S.

These mechanisms include an architectural schema that encourages parallel and incremental information processing, and a method for binding information from distinct representations that when faced with rapid change in the world can maintain a coherent, though distributed, view of it. Provisional results are demonstrated in a robot combining vision, manipulation, language, planning and reasoning capabilities interacting with a human and manipulable objects.|Nick Hawes,Aaron Sloman,Jeremy Wyatt,Michael Zillich,Henrik Jacobsson,Geert-Jan M.

In this paper, we introduce a version of XCS with computed actions, briefly XCSCA, that can be applied to problems involving a large number of actions. We report experimental results showing that XCSCA can evolve accurate and compact representations of binary functions which would be challenging for typical learning classifier system models.|Pier Luca Lanzi,Daniele Loiacono"],["66178|AAAI|2007|Modeling and Learning Vague Event Durations for Temporal Reasoning|This paper reports on our recent work on modeling and automatically extracting vague, implicit event durations from text (Pan et al., a, b).

To explore this question, we have extended previous work on how children and robots learn to play hide and seek to a human-robot team covertly approaching a moving target. We used the cognitive modeling system, ACT-R, with an added spatial module to support the robot's spatial reasoning. The robot interacted with a team member through voice, gestures, and movement during the team's covert approach of a moving target. This paper describes the new robotic system and its integration of metric, symbolic, and cognitive layers of spatial representation and reasoning for its individual and team behavior.|William G.

Our method is as follows we extend Reiter's framework by integrating observation actions and modal operators of knowledge, and encode the resulting formalism in DEL with announcement and assignment operators. By extending Lutz' recent satisfiability-preserving reduction to our logic, we establish optimal decision procedures for both Reiter's and Scherl & Levesque's approaches satisfiability is NP-complete for one agent, PSPACE-complete for multiple agents and EXPTIME-complete when common knowledge is involved.|Hans P. van Ditmarsch,Andreas Herzig,Tiago De Lima","66063|AAAI|2007|Reasoning about Bargaining Situations|This paper presents a logical axiomatization of bargaining solutions. A bargaining situation is described in propositional logic and the bargainers' preferences are quantified in terms of the logical structure of the bargaining situation. A solution to the n-person bargaining problems is proposed based on the maxmin rule over the degrees of bargainers' satisfaction. We show that the solution is uniquely characterized by four natural and intuitive axioms as well as three other fundamental assumptions. All the axioms and assumptions are represented in logical statements and most of them have a game-theoretic counterpart. The framework would help us to identify the logical and numerical reasoning behind bargaining processes.|Dongmo Zhang","66005|AAAI|2007|Beyond Individualism Modeling Team Playing Behavior in Robot Soccer through Case-Based Reasoning|We propose a Case-Based Reasoning approach for action selection in the robot soccer domain presented in the th European Conference on Case-Based Reasoning ().

These include BC and BB contracts and processes, as realized via Web services and other such technologies. Business protocols, an interaction-oriented approach for modeling business processes, are formulated in terms of the commitments. Commitments can support other forms of semantic service composition as well. This paper shows how to represent and reason about commitments in a general manner. Unlike previous formalizations, the proposed formalization accommodates complex and nested commitment conditions, and concurrent commitment operations. In this manner, a rich variety of open business scenarios are enabled.|Nirmit Desai,Amit K. Chopra,Munindar P.

However, most of these systems do not generally adapt to new circumstances, do not self-evaluate and self-configure their own strategies, and do not monitor the usage history of the learning content being delivered or presented to the students. These shortcomings force ITS developers to often spend much development time in manual revision and fine-tuning of the learning and instructional contents of an ITS. In this paper, we describe an intelligent agent that delivers learning material adaptively to different students, factoring in the usage history of the learning materials and student profiles as observed by the agent. Student-tutor interaction includes the activities of going through learning material, such as a topical tutorial, a set of examples, and a set of problems. Our assumption is that our agent will be able to capture and utilize these student activities as the primer to select the appropriate examples or problems to administer to the student. Using an integrated introspective case-based reasoning approach, our agent further learns from its experience and refines its reasoning process-including the instructional strategies-to adapt to student needs. Moreover, our agent monitors the usage history of the learning materials to improve its performance. We have built an end-to-end ITS using an agent powered by this integrated introspective case-based reasoning engine. We have deployed the ITS in a CS course. Results indicate that the ITS was able to learn to deliver more appropriate examples and problems to the students.|Leen-Kiat Soh","66183|AAAI|2007|Integrating Natural Language Knowledge Representation and Reasoning and Analogical Processing to Learn by Reading|Learning by reading requires integrating several strands of AI research. We describe a prototype system, Learning Reader, which combines natural language processing, a large-scale knowledge base, and analogical processing to learn by reading simplified language texts. We outline the architecture of Learning Reader and some of system-level results, then explain how these results arise from the components. Specifically, we describe the design, implementation, and performance characteristics of a natural language understanding model (DMAP) that is tightly coupled to a knowledge base three orders of magnitude larger than previous attempts. We show that knowing the kinds of questions being asked and what might be learned can help provide more relevant, efficient reasoning. Finally, we show that analogical processing provides a means of generating useful new questions and conjectures when the system ruminates off-line about what it has read.|Kenneth D.

Digital certificates are widely used for that purpose. However, practical certification scenarios can be very complex. Each certiticate carries a validity period and can be revoked during this period. Furthermore, the verifying user has to trust the issuers of certificates and revocations. This work presents a formal model which covers these aspects and provides a theoretical foundation for the decision about attribute authenticity even in complex scenarios. The model is based on the event calculus, an AI technique from the field of temporal reasoning. It uses Clark's completion to address the frame problem. An example illustrates the application of the model.|Thomas W√∂lfl"]]}}
