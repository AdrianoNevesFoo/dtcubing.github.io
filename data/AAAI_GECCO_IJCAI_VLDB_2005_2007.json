After selection of some good genes based on signal-to-noise ratio, unsupervised learning like clustering and supervised learning like k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier are widely used in cancer researches to correlate the pathological behavior of cancers with the gene expression levels' differences in cancerous and normal tissues. By applying adaptive searches like Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Algorithm (PMBGA), it may be possible to get a smaller size gene subset that would classify patient samples more accurately than the above methods. In this paper, we propose a new PMBGA based method to extract informative genes from microarray data using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier.

Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme. The proposed scheme reduces Pareto-size and the appropriate number of clusters can usually be determined.|Nobukazu Matake,Tomoyuki Hiroyasu,Mitsunori Miki,Tomoharu Senda","80761|VLDB|2007|Computer Science  A New World of Data Management|Data management, one of the most successful software technologies, is the bedrock of almost all business, government, and scientific activities, worldwide.

A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications.

Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design. Our contribution is the introduction of a general technique for designing SVM kernels tailored for the classification of sequence data.|Young-In Shin,Donald S.

However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction.

In this paper, we extend TD networks by allowing the network-update process (answer network) to depend on the recent history of previous actions and observations rather than only on the most recent action and observation. We show that this extension enables the solution of a larger class of problems than can be solved by the original TD networks or by history-based methods alone. In addition, we apply TD networks to a problem that, while still simple, is significantly larger than has previously been considered. We show that history-extended TD networks can learn much of the common-sense knowledge of an egocentric gridworld domain with a single bit of perception.|Brian Tanner,Richard S.

Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world. The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16267|IJCAI|2005|Conditional Planning in the Discrete Belief Space|Probabilistic planning with observability restrictions, as formalized for example as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), has a wide range of applications, but it is computationally extremely difficult.

Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs. Our empirical results show that our modified IP on mPSRs outperforms, in most cases, IP on both PSRs and POMDPs.|Michael R. James,Satinder P.

Since finding an optimal POMDP policy is intractable, approximation techniques have been a main focus of research, among them point-based algorithms, which scale up relatively well - up to thousands of states. An important decision in a point-based algorithm is the order of backup operations over belief states. Prioritization techniques for ordering the sequence of backup operations reduce the number of needed backups considerably, but involve significant overhead. This paper suggests a new way to order backups, based on a soft clustering of the belief space. Our novel soft clustering method relies on the solution of the underlying MDP. Empirical evaluation verifies that our method rapidly computes a good order of backups, showing orders of magnitude improvement in runtime over a number of benchmarks.|Yan Virin,Guy Shani,Solomon Eyal Shimony,Ronen I.

One approach that effectively addresses the intractable memory requirements of POMDP algorithms is based on representing POMDP policies as finite-state controllers. In this paper, we illustrate some fundamental disadvantages of existing techniques that use controllers. We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques.

Phases are introduced into a model to represent relevant execution history, but there is no physical manifestation of phases in the real world. We treat phases as partially observable state features and show how a belief distribution over phase configurations can be derived from observable state features through the use of transient analysis for Markov chains. This results in an efficient method for phase tracking during execution that can be combined with the QMDP value method for POMDPs to make action choices.

Using this framework, we introduce an extension of the Davis-Putnam algorithm (that we call Max-DPLL) and the resolution rule. Our framework has the advantage of nicely integrating branch and bound concepts such as the lower and upper bound, as well as hiding away implementation details.

Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

They formulate a search problem as the problem of model expansion (MX), which is the problem of expanding a given structure with new relations so that it satisfies a given formula. Their long-term goal is to produce practical tools to solve combinatorial search problems, especially those in NP. In this framework, a problem is encoded in a logic, an instance of the problem is represented by a finite structure, and a solver generates solutions to the problem. This approach relies on propositionalisation of high-level specifications, and on the efficiency of modern SAT solvers. Here, we propose an efficient algorithm which combines grounding with partial evaluation. Since the MX framework is based on classical logic, we are able to take advantage of known results for the so-called guarded fragments. In the case of k-guarded formulas with inductive definitions under a natural restriction, the algorithm performs much better than naive grounding by relying on connections between k-guarded formulas and tree decompositions.|Murray Patterson,Yongmei Liu,Eugenia Ternovska,Arvind Gupta","66191|AAAI|2007|On the Approximation of Instance Level Update and Erasure in Description Logics|A Description Logics knowledge base is constituted by two components, called TBox and ABox, where the former expresses general knowledge about the concepts and their relationships, and the latter describes the properties of instances of concepts. We address the problem of how to deal with changes to a Description Logic knowledge base, when these changes affect only its ABox. We consider two types of changes namely update and erasure, and we characterize the semantics of these operations on the basis of the approaches proposed by Winslett and by Katsuno and Mendelzon. It is well known that, in general, Description Logics are not closed with respect to updates, in the sense that the set of models corresponding to an update applied to a knowledge base in a Description Logic L may not be expressible by ABoxes in L. We show that this is true also for erasure. To deal with this problem, we introduce the notion of best approximation of an update (erasure) in a DL L, with the goal of characterizing the L ABoxes that capture the update (erasure) at best. We then focus on DL-LiteF, a tractable Description Logic, and present polynomial algorithms for computing the best approximation of updates and erasures in this logic, which shows that the nice computational properties of DL-LiteF are retained in dealing with the evolution of the ABox.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Antonella Poggi,Riccardo Rosati","66015|AAAI|2007|Disambiguating Noun Compounds|This paper is concerned with the interaction between word sense disambiguation and the interpretation of noun compounds (NCs) in English.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm. The experimental results indicate that MeSwarm outperforms the standard PSO and several evolutionary algorithms in terms of solution quality.|Bo-Fu Liu,Hung-Ming Chen,Jian-Hung Chen,Shiow-Fen Hwang,Shinn-Ying Ho","57329|GECCO|2005|Improving particle swarm optimization with differentially perturbed velocity|This paper introduces a novel scheme of improving the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO) by a vector differential operator borrowed from differential evolution (DE).

Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme. The proposed scheme reduces Pareto-size and the appropriate number of clusters can usually be determined.|Nobukazu Matake,Tomoyuki Hiroyasu,Mitsunori Miki,Tomoharu Senda","80566|VLDB|2005|XQuery Implementation in a Relational Database System|Many enterprise applications prefer to store XML data as a rich data type, i.e. a sequence of bytes, in a relational database system to avoid the complexity of decomposing the data into a large number of tables and the cost of reassembling the XML data.

Our proposed method first anchors the appearance of entities in Wikipedia articles using some heuristic rules that are supported by their encyclopedic style.

The resulting motion patterns are so characteristic for robots that people imitating robotic behavior will do so by making abrupt movements between actions.

In this computation model a robot first learns situation-specific performance models of abstract actions. It then uses these models to automatically specialize the abstract actions for their execution in a given action chain. This specialization results in refined chains that are optimized for performance.

The CTBN framework is based on homogeneous Markov processes, and defines two distributions with respect to each local variable in the system, given its parents an exponential distribution over when the variable transitions, and a multinomial over what is the next value. In this paper, we present two extensions to the framework that make it more useful in modeling practical applications. The first extension models arbitrary transition time distributions using Erlang-Coxian approximations, while maintaining tractable learning. We show how the censored data problem arises in learning the distribution, and present a solution based on expectation-maximization initialized by the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The second extension is a general method for reasoning about negative evidence, by introducing updates that assert no observable events occur over an interval of time. Such updates were not defined in the original CTBN framework, and we show that their inclusion can significantly improve the accuracy of filtering and prediction. We illustrate and evaluate these extensions in two real-world domains, email use and GPS traces of a person traveling about a city.|Karthik Gopalratnam,Henry A. Kautz,Daniel S.

Domain knowledge can come in many forms. For example, expert knowledge about the relevance of variables relative to a certain problem can help perform better feature selection. Domain knowledge about the conditional independence relationships among variables can help learning of the Bayesian Network structure. This paper considers a different type of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian Networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that comes in the form of inequality constraints among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian Network with known structure.

Results indicate that for problems with low number of parameters, both the algorithms are quite comparable. However, real world models such as genetic networks have a large number of parameters and the UCPR fails in finding good convergence due to its limited search capabilities.

On the other hand, although a Bayesian network can represent arbitrary attribute dependencies, learning an optimal Bayesian network from data is intractable. The main reason is that learning the optimal structure of a Bayesian network is extremely time consuming. Thus, a Bayesian model without structure learning is desirable. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called hidden naive Bayes (HNB). In an HNB, a hidden parent is created for each attribute which combines the influences from all other attributes. We present an approach to creating hidden parents using the average of weighted one-dependence estimators. HNB inherits the structural simplicity of naive Bayes and can be easily learned without structure learning. We propose an algorithm for learning HNB based on conditional mutual information. We experimentally test HNB in terms of classification accuracy, using the  UCI data sets recommended by Weka (Witten & Frank ), and compare it to naive Bayes (Langley, Iba, & Thomas ), C. (Quinlan ), SBC (Langley & Sage ), NBTree (Kohavi ), CL-TAN (Friedman, Geiger, & Goldszmidt ), and AODE (Webb, Boughton, & Wang ). The experimental results show that HNB outperforms naive Bayes, C., SBC, NBTree, and CL-TAN, and is competitive with AODE.|Harry Zhang,Liangxiao Jiang,Jiang Su","58197|GECCO|2007|Order or not does parallelization of model building in hBOA affect its scalability|It has been shown that model building in the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) can be efficiently parallelized by randomly generating an ancestral ordering of the nodes of the network prior to learning the network structure and allowing only dependencies consistent with the generated ordering. However, it has not been thoroughly shown that this approach to restricting probabilistic models does not affect scalability of hBOA on important classes of problems. This paper demonstrates that although the use of a random ancestral ordering restricts the structure of considered models to allow efficient parallelization of model building, its effects on hBOA performance and scalability are negligible.|Martin Pelikan,James D.

The first reduces a network to its maximal weight spanning tree using the Kullback-Leibler information divergence as edge weights, and then runs Pearl's algorithm on the resulting tree for linear-time inference. The second algorithm deletes edges from the triangulated graph until the biggest clique in the triangulated graph is below a desired bound, thus placing a polynomial time bound on inference. When tested for efficiency, these two algorithms perform up to , times faster than exact techniques.

This paper considers how to represent and exploit hierarchical structure in probabilistic reasoning. We represent the distribution for such variables by specifying, for each class, the probability distribution over its immediate subclasses. We represent the conditional probability distribution of any variable conditioned on hierarchical variables using inheritance. We present an approach for reasoning in Bayesian networks with hierarchically structured variables that dynamically constructs a flat Bayesian network, given some evidence and a query, by collapsing the hierarchies to include only those values necessary to answer the query. This can be done with a single pass over the network. We can answer the query from the flat Bayesian network using any standard probabilistic inference algorithm such as variable elimination or stochastic simulation. The domain size of the variables in the flat Bayesian network is independent of the size of the hierarchies it depends on how many of the classes in the hierarchies are directly associated with the evidence and query. Thus, the representation is applicable even when the hierarchy is conceptually infinite.|Rita Sharma,David Poole","57437|GECCO|2005|Learning computer programs with the bayesian optimization algorithm|We describe an extension of the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA), a probabilistic model building genetic algorithm, to the domain of program tree evolution.

However, when continuous variables are present in Bayesian networks, their dependence relationships could be nonlinear and their probability distributions could be arbitrary. So far no efficient inference algorithm could deal with this case except Monte Carlo simulation methods such as Likelihood Weighting. But with unlikely evidence, simulation methods could be very slow to converge. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximate inference algorithm called Unscented Message Passing (UMP-BN) for Bayesian networks with arbitrary continuous variables. UMP-BN combines unscented transformation - a deterministic sampling method, and Pearl's message passing algorithm to provide the estimates of the first two moments of the posterior distributions. We test this algorithm with several networks including the ones with nonlinear andor non-Gaussian variables. The numerical experiments show that UMP-BN converges very fast and produces promising results.|Wei Sun,Kuo-Chu Chang"]]},"title":{"entropy":6.366232970587566,"topics":["the web, artificial immune, the and, search space, mobile robot, search for, and search, feature selection, neural networks, local search, from the, search, named entity, immune system, web service, the search, and application, service composition, ant colony, web search","system for, for data, support vector, natural language, sense disambiguation, word disambiguation, word sense, learning for, time series, vector machine, combinatorial auctions, support machine, data, data mining, machine learning, query for, large scale, situation calculus, and data, data streams","algorithm for, genetic algorithm, genetic programming, particle swarm, genetic for, the problems, evolutionary algorithm, for problems, for optimization, algorithm the, using genetic, evolutionary for, and genetic, using algorithm, optimization, particle optimization, optimization algorithm, and algorithm, algorithm with, swarm optimization","for and, for planning, description logic, and, models for, reinforcement learning, constraint satisfaction, learning and, for logic, logic programs, planning with, reasoning about, learning for, constraint and, models and, markov processes, the complexity, bayesian networks, logic programming, logic","for selection, the web, for feature, feature selection, and retrieval, web service, towards the, service composition, and evaluation, and selection, automatic for, web and, the service, web page, web composition, semantic web, negative selection, selection, for retrieval, web search","for networks, mobile robot, neural networks, for robot, for based, for object, dynamic environments, sensor networks, image using, social networks, for mobile, based and, networks, using networks, for social, object tracking, for environments, and discovery, and networks, from observation","learning for, support vector, natural language, sense disambiguation, word disambiguation, word sense, vector machine, for machine, language for, support machine, learning, and machine, support for, machine learning, word with, learning from, learning with, learning and, language and, for statistical","combinatorial auctions, large scale, situation calculus, management system, materialized views, for pattern, and auctions, for over, pattern database, measures for, efficient over, views for, for case-based, efficient for, for negotiation, and via, and querying, for management, for auctions, spatial for","evolution for, the evolution, for scheduling, differential evolution, strategies for, new for, and evolution, mutation for, algorithm scheduling, evolution strategies, using evolution, building block, and strategies, scheduling problems, local algorithm, algorithm for, for problems, mutation operator, evolution, local search","algorithm for, for optimization, particle swarm, optimization algorithm, particle optimization, swarm optimization, evolutionary optimization, evolutionary algorithm, optimization, for dynamic, optimization and, distributed optimization, multiobjective optimization, and algorithm, heuristic for, optimization with, hybrid for, algorithm the, algorithm with, swarm for","and reasoning, for reasoning, framework for, for knowledge, reasoning about, knowledge and, markov processes, markov decision, temporal reasoning, probabilistic and, probabilistic for, reasoning, markov models, the reasoning, reasoning with, hidden markov, knowledge, framework and, knowledge bases, hidden models","for planning, for and, and, with and, planning with, planning and, planning domains, the and, representations and, learning and, representations for, predictive representations, combining and, and system, state for, temporal and, theory and, predictive state, state representations, and search"],"ranking":[["16062|IJCAI|2005|A Study of Selection Noise in Collaborative Web Search|Collaborative Web search uses the past search behaviour (queries and selections) of a community of users to promote search results that are relevant to the community.

For ambiguous queries, a traditional approach is to organize search results into groups (clusters), one for each meaning of the query. These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","65528|AAAI|2005|SenseRelate  TargetWord-A Generalized Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation|Many words in natural language have different meanings when used in different contexts.

This paper considers transfer learning with Markov logic networks (MLNs), a powerful formalism for learning in relational domains. We present a complete MLN transfer system that first autonomously maps the predicates in the source MLN to the target domain and then revises the mapped structure to further improve its accuracy. Our results in several real-world domains demonstrate that our approach successfully reduces the amount of time and training data needed to learn an accurate model of a target domain over learning from scratch.|Lilyana Mihalkova,Tuyen N.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

However, previous results do not address the important classes of stratified programs and its subclass of acyclic (i.e., recursion-free) programs, although they are recognized as important tools for knowledge representation and reasoning. In this paper, we consider such programs, possibly augmented with constraints. Our results show that in the propositional setting, where reasoning is well-known to be polynomial, deciding strong and uniform equivalence is as hard as for arbitrary normal logic programs (and thus coNP-complete), but is polynomial in some restricted cases. Nonground programs behave similarly. However, exponential lower bounds already hold for small programs (i.e., with constantly many rules). In particular, uniform equivalence is undecidable even for small Horn programs plus a single negative constraint.|Thomas Eiter,Michael Fink,Hans Tompits,Stefan Woltran","16539|IJCAI|2007|Epistemic Reasoning in Logic Programs|Although epistemic logic programming has an enhanced capacity to handle complex incomplete information reasoning and represent agents' epistemic behaviours, it embeds a significantly higher computational complexity than non-disjunctive and disjunctive answer set programming.

In particular, we show that Lee and Lifschitz's result on loop formulas for disjunctive logic programs can be extended to a special class of epistemic logic programs. We also study the polysize model property for epistemic logic programs. Based on these discoveries, we identify two non-trivial classes of epistemic logic programs whose consistency checking complexity is reduced from PSPACE-complete to NP-complete and P -complete respectively. We observe that many important applications on epistemic representation fall into these two classes of epistemic logic programs.|Yan Zhang","65544|AAAI|2005|Towards Learning Stochastic Logic Programs from Proof-Banks|Stochastic logic programs combine ideas from probabilistic grammars with the expressive power of definite clause logic as such they can be considered as an extension of probabilistic context-free grammars.

This allows us to avoid the explosion of the search space due to the usually large and possibly infinite ranges of data values that are exchanged among services, and thus to scale up the applicability of state-of-the-art techniques for the automated composition of web services.

In this paper we propose a mean of performing automated Web service composition by exploiting semantic matchmaking between Web service parameters (i.e., outputs and inputs) to enable their connection and interaction. The key idea is that the matchmaking enables, at run time, finding semantic compatibilities among independently defined Web service descriptions. To this end, our approach extends existing methods in order to explain misconnections between Web services. From this we generate Web service compositions that realize the goal, satisfying and optimizing the semantic connections between Web services. Moreover a process of relaxing the hard constraints is introduced in case the composition process failed. Our system is implemented and interacting with Web services dedicated on a Telecom scenario.

Amongst these, a prominent one is automated Web Service Composition (WSC). One important issue in this context has been hardly addressed so far WSC requires dealing with background ontologies. The support for those is severely limited in current planning tools. We introduce a planning formalism that faithfully represents WSC. We show that, unsurprisingly, planning in such a formalism is very hard. We then identify an interesting special case that covers many relevant WSC scenarios, and where the semantics are simpler and easier to deal with. This opens the way to the development of effective support tools for WSC. Furthermore, we show that if one additionally limits the amount and form of outputs that can be generated, then the set of possible states becomes static, and can be modelled in terms of a standard notion of initial state uncertainty. For this, effective tools exist these can realize scalable WSC with powerful background ontologies. In an initial experiment, we show how scaling WSC instances are comfortably solved by a tool incorporating modern planning heuristics.|Jörg Hoffmann,Piergiorgio Bertoli,Marco Pistore","80484|VLDB|2005|Automatic Composition of Transition-based Semantic Web Services with Messaging|In this paper we present Colombo, a framework in which web services are characterized in terms of (i) the atomic processes (i.e., operations) they can perform (ii) their impact on the \"real world\" (modeled as a relational database) (iii) their transition-based behavior and (iv) the messages they can send and receive (fromto other web services and \"human\" clients). As such, Colombo combines key elements from the standards and research literature on (semantic) web services.

For ambiguous queries, a traditional approach is to organize search results into groups (clusters), one for each meaning of the query. These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate. Combined with a content-driven Web page clustering technique, our heuristic search system significantly improves the clustering results.|Ron Bekkerman,Shlomo Zilberstein,James Allan","57566|GECCO|2005|Automatic feature selection in neuroevolution|Feature selection is the process of finding the set of inputs to a machine learning algorithm that will yield the best performance. Developing a way to solve this problem automatically would make current machine learning methods much more useful. Previous efforts to automate feature selection rely on expensive meta-learning or are applicable only when labeled training data is available. This paper presents a novel method called FS-NEAT which extends the NEAT neuroevolution method to automatically determine an appropriate set of inputs for the networks it evolves. By learning the network's inputs, topology, and weights simultaneously, FS-NEAT addresses the feature selection problem without relying on meta-learning or labeled data. Initial experiments in an autonomous car racing simulation demonstrate that FS-NEAT can learn better and faster than regular NEAT. In addition, the networks it evolves are smaller and require fewer inputs. Furthermore, FS-NEAT's performance remains robust even as the feature selection task it faces is made increasingly difficult.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone,Kenneth O.

Then various rate estimators are discussed, showing experimentally how precise they are. This paper explores two classes of problems. Firstly the localized rate of updates is estimated by dividing the given sequence of independent and inconsistent update points into consistent windows. From various experimental comparisons, the proposed Weibull estimator outperforms Duane plot(another proposed estimator) and other estimators proposed by Cho et al. and Norman Matloff in .%(.%) of the whole windows for synthetic(real Web) datasets.

For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states. We also show its superior performance over the centralized schemes in terms of update, query, and total communication costs.|Arnab Bhattacharya,Anand Meka,Ambuj K.

However, the development of SANNs has traditionally focused on data domains that are assumed to be modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of data governed by other statistical models, such as the Poisson distribution, has received less attention from the data mining community. Based on special considerations of the statistical nature of data following a Poisson distribution, this paper introduces a SANN, Poisson-based Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (PSOTA), which implements novel similarity matching criteria and neuron weight adaptation schemes. It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood. This study indicate that, in comparison to the traditional Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA), PSOTA offers significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization in data modeled by the Poisson distribution, such as serial analysis of gene expression data.|Haiying Wang,Huiru Zheng,Francisco Azuaje","16436|IJCAI|2007|Dynamic Weighting A Search-Based MAP Algorithm for Bayesian Networks|In this paper we propose the Dynamic Weighting A* (DWA*) search algorithm for solving MAP problems in Bayesian networks.

Third, the approach makes a large body of research into more structured representations of factors relevant in many more circumstances than it has been previously. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that VE can exploit local structure as effectively as state-of-the-art algorithms based on conditioning on the networks considered, and can sometimes lead to much faster compilation times.|Mark Chavira,Adnan Darwiche","66259|AAAI|2007|SUNNY A New Algorithm for Trust Inference in Social Networks Using Probabilistic Confidence Models|In many computing systems, information is produced and processed by many people.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16405|IJCAI|2007|Detection of Cognitive States from fMRI Data Using Machine Learning Techniques|Over the past decade functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful technique to locate activity of human brain while engaged in a particular task or cognitive state.

This \"bid-takers exposure problem\" may be preemptively addressed by finding a solution that is robust to winning-bid withdrawal. We introduce the concept of monotonicity-in-expectation. We provide impossibility results concerning truthful mechanisms for robust solutions with bounded social-welfare losses in which the bid-taker cannot rescind items from winning bidders to repair a solution.

However, it is known that for combinatorial auctions that use the VCG mechanism, a seller can sometimes increase revenue by dropping bidders. In this paper we investigate the extent to which this problem can occur under other dominant-strategy combinatorial auction mechanisms. Our main result is that such failures of \"revenue monotonicity\" are not limited to mechanisms that achieve efficient allocations. Instead, they can occur under any dominant-strategy direct mechanism that sets prices using critical values, and that always chooses an allocation that cannot be augmented to make some bidder better off, while making none worse off.|Baharak Rastegari,Anne Condon,Kevin Leyton-Brown","80741|VLDB|2007|Efficient Keyword Search over Virtual XML Views|Emerging applications such as personalized portals, enterprise search and web integration systems often require keyword search over semi-structured views. However, traditional information retrieval techniques are likely to be expensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized. Our performance evaluation using the INEX data set in the Quark  open-source XML database system indicates that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient.|Feng Shao,Lin Guo,Chavdar Botev,Anand Bhaskar,Muthiah Chettiar,Fan Yang 0002,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram","65483|AAAI|2005|Approximating Revenue-Maximizing Combinatorial Auctions|Designing revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions (CAs) is a recognized open problem in mechanism design. It is unsolved even for two bidders and two items for sale. Rather than attempting to characterize the optimal auction, we focus on designing approximations (suboptimal auction mechanisms which yield high revenue). Our approximations belong to the family of virtual valuations combinatorial auctions (VVCA). VVCA is a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism run on virtual valuations that are linear transformations of the bidders' real valuations. We pursue two approaches to constructing approximately optimal CAs. The first is to construct a VVCA with worst-case and average-case performance guarantees. We give a logarithmic approximation auction for basic important special cases of the problem ) limited supply of items on sale with additive valuations and ) unlimited supply. The second approach is to search the parameter space of VVCAs in order to obtain high-revenue mechanisms for the general problem. We introduce a series of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that use economic insights to guide the search and thus reduce the computational complexity. Our experiments demonstrate that in many cases these algorithms perform almost as well as the optimal VVCA, yield a substantial increase in revenue over the VCG mechanism and drastically outperform the straightforward algorithms in run-time.|Anton Likhodedov,Tuomas Sandholm","80490|VLDB|2005|PSYCHO A Prototype System for Pattern Management|Patterns represent in a compact and rich in semantics way huge quantity of heterogeneous data.

Best response dynamics is a method of searching for pure-strategy equilibria in games that is attractive for its simplicity and scalability (relative to more analytical approaches). However, when the cost of determining the outcome of a particular set of joint strategies is high, it is impractical to compute the payoffs of all possible responses to the other players actions. Thus, we study metaheuristic approaches--genetic algorithms and tabu search in particular--to explore the strategy space.

Denoting by Gk the class of valuations displaying up to k-wise dependencies, we consider the hierarchy G  G  ...  Gm, where m is the number of items for sale. We show that the minimum non-trivial degree of interdependency (-wise dependency) is sufficient to render NP-hard the problem of computing the optimal allocation (but we also exhibit a restricted class of such valuations for which computing the optimal allocation is easy). On the other hand, bidders' preferences can be communicated efficiently (i.e., exchanging a polynomial amount of information) as long as the interdependencies between items are limited to sets of cardinality up to k, where k is an arbitrary constant. The amount of communication required to transmit the bidders' preferences becomes super-polynomial (under the assumption that only value queries are allowed) when interdependencies occur between sets of cardinality g(m), where g(m) is an arbitrary function such that g(m)   as m  .

Today, database systems typically maintain views eagerly in the same transaction as the base table updates. This has the effect that updates pay for view maintenance while beneficiaries (queries) get a free ride View maintenance overhead can be significant and it seems unfair to have updates bear the cost. We present a novel way to lazily maintain materialized views that relieves updates of this overhead. Maintenance of a view is postponed until the system has free cycles or the view is referenced by a query. View maintenance is fully or partly hidden from queries depending on the system load. Ideally, views are maintained entirely on system time at no cost to updates and queries. The efficiency of lazy maintenance is improved by combining updates from several transactions into a single maintenance operation, by condensing multiple updates of the same row into a single update, and by exploiting row versioning. Experiments using a prototype implementation in Microsoft SQL Server show much faster response times for updates and also significant reduction in maintenance cost when combining updates.|Jingren Zhou,Per-\u2026ke Larson,Hicham G.

Then the target population is recombined with the mutant population in order to generate a trial population. Finally, a selection operator is applied to both target and trial populations to determine who will survive for the next generation based on fitness evaluations.

In our approach the LMS are implemented via learned probabilistic context-sensitive grammar (LPCSG). The LPCSG is derived from the originally defined context-free grammar, which usually expresses the syntax of genetic programs in canonical GP. Applying LMS implies that the probabilities of applying each of particular production rules in LPCGS during the mutation depend on the context. These probabilities are learned from the aggregated reward values obtained from the parsed syntax of the evolved best-of-generation Snakebots. Empirically obtained results verify that LMS contributes to the improvement of computational effort of both (i) the evolution of the fastest possible locomotion gaits for various fitness conditions and (ii) the adaptation of these locomotion gaits to challenging environment and degraded mechanical abilities of Snakebot.

We introduce a structure, the state agnostic planning graph, that directly, solves the all-pairs problem for the relaxation introduced by planning graphs. The technique can also be characterized as exploiting the overlap present in sets of planning graphs. For the purpose of exposition, we first present the technique in classical planning. The more prominent application of tnis technique is in belief-space planning, where an optimization results in drastically improved theoretical complexity. Our experimental evaluation quantifies this performance boost. and demonstrates that heuristic belief-space progression planning using our technique is competitive with the state of t the art.|William Cushing,Daniel Bryce","16502|IJCAI|2007|Relational Knowledge with Predictive State Representations|Most work on Predictive Representations of State (PSRs) has focused on learning and planning in unstructured domains (for example, those represented by flat POMDPs). This paper extends PSRs to represent relational knowledge about domains, so that they can use policies that generalize across different tasks, capture knowledge that ignores irrelevant attributes of objects, and represent policies in a way that is independent of the size of the state space. Using a blocks world domain, we show how generalized predictions about the future can compactly capture relations between objects, which in turn can be used to naturally specify relational-style options and policies. Because our representation is expressed solely in terms of actions and observations, it has extensive semantics which are statistics about observable quantities.|David Wingate,Vishal Soni,Britton Wolfe,Satinder P. Singh","66019|AAAI|2007|Web Service Composition as Planning Revisited In Between Background Theories and Initial State Uncertainty|Thanks to recent advances, AI Planning has become the underlying technique for several applications. Amongst these, a prominent one is automated Web Service Composition (WSC). One important issue in this context has been hardly addressed so far WSC requires dealing with background ontologies. The support for those is severely limited in current planning tools. We introduce a planning formalism that faithfully represents WSC. We show that, unsurprisingly, planning in such a formalism is very hard. We then identify an interesting special case that covers many relevant WSC scenarios, and where the semantics are simpler and easier to deal with. This opens the way to the development of effective support tools for WSC. Furthermore, we show that if one additionally limits the amount and form of outputs that can be generated, then the set of possible states becomes static, and can be modelled in terms of a standard notion of initial state uncertainty. For this, effective tools exist these can realize scalable WSC with powerful background ontologies. In an initial experiment, we show how scaling WSC instances are comfortably solved by a tool incorporating modern planning heuristics.|Jörg Hoffmann,Piergiorgio Bertoli,Marco Pistore","16328|IJCAI|2005|Learning Subjective Representations for Planning|Planning involves using a model of an agent's actions to find a sequence of decisions which achieve a desired goal. It is usually assumed that the models are given, and such models often require expert knowledge of the domain. This paper explores subjective representations for planning that are learned directly from agent observations and actions (requiring no initial domain knowledge). A non-linear embedding technique called Action Respecting Embedding is used to construct such a representation. It is then shown how to extract the effects of the agent's actions as operators in this learned representation. Finally, the learned representation and operators are combined with search to find sequences of actions that achieve given goals. The efficacy of this technique is demonstrated in a challenging robot-vision-inspired image domain.|Dana F. Wilkinson,Michael H. Bowling,Ali Ghodsi","16261|IJCAI|2005|Using Predictive Representations to Improve Generalization in Reinforcement Learning|The predictive representations hypothesis holds that particularly good generalization will result from representing the state of the world in terms of predictions about possible future experience. This hypothesis has been a central motivation behind recent research in, for example, PSRs and TD networks. In this paper we present the first explicit investigation of this hypothesis. We show in a reinforcement-learning example (a grid-world navigation task) that a predictive representation in tabular form can learn much faster than both the tabular explicit-state representation and a tabular history-based method.|Eddie J.

We demonstrate that a mapping between the agent's predictive state representation and abstract features can be derived automatically from high-level training data supplied by the designer. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that an experience-oriented state representation built around a single-bit sensor can represent useful abstract features such as \"back against a wall\", \"in a corner\", or \"in a room\". As a result, the agent gains virtual sensors that could be used by its control policy.|Brian Tanner,Vadim Bulitko,Anna Koop,Cosmin Paduraru","65451|AAAI|2005|Planning in Models that Combine Memory with Predictive Representations of State|Models of dynamical systems based on predictive state representations (PSRs) use predictions of future observations as their representation of state. A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs. Our empirical results show that our modified IP on mPSRs outperforms, in most cases, IP on both PSRs and POMDPs.|Michael R. James,Satinder P. Singh","65613|AAAI|2005|Learning Measures of Progress for Planning Domains|We study an approach to learning heuristics for planning domains from example solutions. There has been little work on learning heuristics for the types of domains used in deterministic and stochastic planning competitions. Perhaps one reason for this is the challenge of providing a compact heuristic language that facilitates learning. Here we introduce a new representation for heuristics based on lists of set expressions described using taxonomic syntax. Next, we review the idea of a measure of progress (parmar ), which is any heuristic that is guaranteed to be improvable at every state. We take finding a measure of progress as our learning goal, and describe a simple learning algorithm for this purpose. We evaluate our approach across a range of deterministic and stochastic planning-competition domains. The results show that often greedily following the learned heuristic is highly effective. We also show our heuristic can be combined with learned rule-based policies, producing still stronger results.|Sung Wook Yoon,Alan Fern,Robert Givan","16164|IJCAI|2005|Combining Memory and Landmarks with Predictive State Representations|It has recently been proposed that it is advantageous to have models of dynamical systems be based solely on observable quantities. Predictive state representations (PSRs) are a type of model that uses predictions about future observations to capture the state of a dynamical system. However, PSRs do not use memory of past observations. We propose a model called memory-PSRs that uses both memories of the past, and predictions of the future. We show that the use of memories provides a number of potential advantages. It can reduce the size of the model (in comparison to a PSR model). In addition many dynamical systems have memories that can serve as landmarks that completely determine the current state. The detection and recognition of landmarks is advantageous because they can serve to reset a model that has gotten off-track, as often happens when the model is learned from samples. This paper develops both memory-PSRs and the use and detection of landmarks.|Michael R. James,Britton Wolfe,Satinder P. Singh"]]}}
