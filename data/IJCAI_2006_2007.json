However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction. Simple examples are given in order to show the advantages of the algorithm.|Marc G.

We formalize a class of such problems and analyze its characteristics, showing that it is NP complete and that optimal policies are deterministic. Our analysis lays the foundation for designing two optimal algorithms.

A lot of effort has been made to develop approximate offline algorithms to solve ever larger POMDPs. However, even state-of-the-art approaches fail to solve large POMDPs in reasonable time. Recent developments in online POMDP search suggest that combining offline computations with online computations is often more efficient and can also considerably reduce the error made by approximate policies computed offline. In the same vein, we propose a new anytime online search algorithm which seeks to minimize, as efficiently as possible, the error made by an approximate value function computed offline. In addition, we show how previous online computations can be reused in following time steps in order to prevent redundant computations. Our preliminary results indicate that our approach is able to tackle large state space and observation space efficiently and under real-time constraints.|St√©phane Ross,Brahim Chaib-draa","16461|IJCAI|2007|Topological Mapping through Distributed Passive Sensors|In this paper we address the problem of inferring the topology, or inter-node navigability, of a sensor network given non-discriminating observations of activity in the environment.

Our new method significantly reduces the overhead of performing decomposition during search when dynamic variable orderings are employed. In addition, it supports the exploitation of dynamic symmetries that appear only during search. Symmetries have not previously been combined with decomposition.

In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal. Our experimental results show that TVI outperforms VI, LAO, LRTDP and HDP on our benchmark MDPs.|Peng Dai,Judy Goldsmith","16621|IJCAI|2007|Solving POMDPs Using Quadratically Constrained Linear Programs|Developing scalable algorithms for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is an important challenge. One approach that effectively addresses the intractable memory requirements of POMDP algorithms is based on representing POMDP policies as finite-state controllers. In this paper, we illustrate some fundamental disadvantages of existing techniques that use controllers. We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques.

The backtrack algorithms that maintain some local consistency during search have become the de facto standard to solve CSPs. Maintaining higher levels of consistency, generally, reduces the search effort. However, due to ineffective constraint propagation, it often penalises the search algorithm in terms of time. If we can reduce ineffective constraint propagation, then the effectiveness of a search algorithm can be enhanced significantly. In order to do so, we use a probabilistic approach to resolve when to propagate and when not to. The idea is to perform only the useful consistency checking by not seeking a support when there is a high probability that a support exists. The idea of probabilistic support inference is general and can be applied to any kind of local consistency algorithm. However, we shall study its impact with respect to arc consistency and singleton arc consistency (SAC). Experimental results demonstrate that enforcing probabilistic SAC almost always enforces SAC, but it requires significantly less time than SAC. Likewise, maintaining probabilistic arc consistency and maintaining probabilistic SAC require significantly less time than maintaining arc consistency and maintaining SAC.|Deepak Mehta,Marc R.

One approach to achieve required sensing coverage is to use robots to convey sensors within this space. Planning the motion of these robots - coordinating their paths in order to maximize the amount of information collected while placing bounds on their resources (e.g., path length or energy capacity) - is aNP-hard problem. In this paper, we present an efficient path planning algorithm that coordinates multiple robots, each having a resource constraint, to maximize the \"informativeness\" of their visited locations. In particular, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to characterize the amount of information collected. We provide strong theoretical approximation guarantees for our algorithm by exploiting the submodularity property of mutual information. In addition, we improve the efficiency of our approach by extending the algorithm using branch and bound and a region-based decomposition of the space. We provide an extensive empirical analysis of our algorithm, comparing with existing heuristics on datasets from several real world sensing applications.|Amarjeet Singh 0003,Andreas Krause,Carlos Guestrin,William J.

One state of the art measure is the longest common subsequence. This measure advocates using the length of the longest common subsequence as an indication of similarity between sequences, but ignores information contained in the second, third..., longest subsequences. In order to capture the common information in sequences maximally we propose a novel measure of sequence similarity - the number of all common subsequences. We show that this measure satisfies the common properties of similarity functions. Calculating this measure is not trivial as a brute force approach is exponential in time. We present a novel dynamic programming algorithm to calculate this number in polynomial time. We also suggest a different way of extending a class of such measures to multidimensional, real-valued time series, in the spirit of probabilistic metric spaces. We conducted an experimental study on the new similarity measure and the extension method for classification. It was found that both the new similarity and the extension method are consistently competitive.|Hui Wang","16349|IJCAI|2007|A Subspace Kernel for Nonlinear Feature Extraction|Kernel based nonlinear Feature Extraction (KFE) or dimensionality reduction is a widely used preprocessing step in pattern classification and data mining tasks. Given a positive definite kernel function, it is well known that the input data are implicitly mapped to a feature space with usually very high dimensionality. The goal of KFE is to find a low dimensional subspace of this feature space, which retains most of the information needed for classification or data analysis. In this paper, we propose a subspace kernel based on which the feature extraction problem is transformed to a kernel parameter learning problem. The key observation is that when projecting data into a low dimensional subspace of the feature space, the parameters that are used for describing this subspace can be regarded as the parameters of the kernel function between the projected data. Therefore current kernel parameter learning methods can be adapted to optimize this parameterized kernel function. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.|Mingrui Wu,Jason D. R.

DMMs do not have the noticeable drawback of the SVD-based methods for data streams negative values in hidden variables are often produced even with all non-negative inputs. We apply DMM models to two real-world datasets, and achieve significantly better results with intuitive interpretation.|Xing Wei,Jimeng Sun,Xuerui Wang","16727|IJCAI|2007|Fast Incremental Square Root Information Smoothing|We propose a novel approach to the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on incremental smoothing, that is suitable for real-time applications in large-scale environments. The main advantages over filter-based algorithms are that we solve the full SLAM problem without the need for any approximations, and that we do not suffer from linearization errors. We achieve efficiency by updating the square-root information matrix, a factored version of the naturally sparse smoothing information matrix. We can efficiently recover the exact trajectory and map at any given time by back-substitution. Furthermore, our approach allows access to the exact covariances, as it does not suffer from under-estimation of uncertainties, which is another problem inherent to filters. We present simulation-based results for the linear case, showing constant time updates for exploration tasks. We further evaluate the behavior in the presence of loops, and discuss how our approach extends to the non-linear case.

Traditionally initial modes are chosen randomly. As a consequence of that, the clustering results cannot be generated and repeated consistently. In this paper we present an approach to compute initial modes for K-mode clustering algorithm to cluster categorical data sets. Here, we utilize the idea of Evidence Accumulation for combining the results of multiple clusterings. Initially, n F - dimensional data is decomposed into a large number of compact clusters the K-modes algorithm performs this decomposition, with several clusterings obtained by N random initializations of the K- modes algorithm. The modes thus obtained from every run of random initializations are stored in a Mode-Pool, PN. The objective is to investigate the contribution of those data objectspatterns that are less vulnerable to the choice of random selection of modes and to choose the most diverse set of modes from the available Mode-Pool that can be utilized as initial modes for the K-mode clustering algorithm. Experimentally we found that by this method we get initial modes that are very similar to the actualdesired modes and gives consistent and better clustering results with less variance of clustering error than the traditional method of choosing random modes.|Shehroz S.

Such a representation is useful for a variety of tasks where treating a product as a set of attribute-value pairs is more useful than as an atomic entity. Examples of such applications include product recommendations, product comparison, and demand forecasting.

The extraction system requires very little initial user supervision using unlabeled data, we automatically extract an initial seed list that serves as training data for the supervised and semi-supervised classification algorithms.

Our system builds generalizations for categories of objects based upon previous sketches of those objects and uses those generalizations to classify new sketches. We represent sketches qualitatively because we believe qualitative information provides a level of description that abstracts away details that distract from classification, such as exact dimensions. Bayesian reasoning is used in building representations to deal with the inherent uncertainty in perception. Qualitative representations are compared using SME, a computational model of analogy and similarity that is supported by psychological evidence, including studies of perceptual similarity. We use SEQL to produce generalizations based on the common structure found by SME in different sketches of the same object. We report on the results of testing the system on a corpus of sketches of everyday objects, drawn by ten different people.|Andrew M. Lovett,Morteza Dehghani,Kenneth D.

We first generate a series of very simple BNs, and put them in the framework of GAM, then adopt a gradient-based algorithm to learn the combining parameters, and thus construct a more powerful classifier. On a large suite of benchmark data sets, the proposed approach outperforms many traditional BNCs, such as naive Bayes, TAN, etc, and achieves comparable or better performance in comparison to boosted Bayesian network classifiers.|Jianguo Li,Changshui Zhang,Tao Wang,Yimin Zhang"],["16432|IJCAI|2007|Fast Image Alignment Using Anytime Algorithms|Image alignment refers to finding the best transformation from a fixed reference image to a new image of a scene. This process is often guided by similarity measures between images, computed based on the image data. However, in time-critical applications state-of-the-art methods for computing similarity are too slow. Instead of using all the image data to compute similarity, one can use a subset of pixels to improve the speed, but often this comes at the cost of reduced accuracy. This makes the problem of image alignment a natural application domain for deliberation control using anytime algorithms. However, almost no research has been done in this direction. In this paper, we present anytime versions for the computation of two common image similarity measures mean squared difference and mutual information. Off-line, we learn a performance profile specific to each measure, which is then used on-line to select the appropriate amount of pixels to process at each optimization step.

Unfortunately, inference scales quadratically in the number of labels, which is problematic for training methods where inference is repeatedly preformed and is the primary computational bottleneck for large label sets. Recent work has used output coding to address this issue by converting a problem with many labels to a set of problems with binary labels. Models were independently trained for each binary problem, at a much reduced computational cost, and then combined for joint inference over the original labels. Here we revisit this idea and show through experiments on synthetic and benchmark data sets that the approach can perform poorly when it is critical to explicitly capture the Markovian transition structure of the large-label problem. We then describe a simple cascade-training approach and show that it can improve performance on such problems with negligible computational overhead.|Guohua Hao,Alan Fern","16493|IJCAI|2007|Backtracking Procedures for Hypertree HyperSpread and Connected Hypertree Decomposition of CSPs|Hypertree decomposition has been shown to be the most general CSP decomposition method.

Previous work has shown how this hierarchical structure can be exploited by solving several sub-MDPs representing the different subtasks in different calling contexts, and a root MDP responsible for sequencing and synchronizing the subtasks, instead of a huge MDP representing the whole problem. Another important idea used by efficient algorithms for solving flat MDPs, such as (L)AO and (L)RTDP, is to exploit reachability information and an admissible heuristics in order to accelerate the search by pruning states that cannot be reached from a given starting state under an optimal policy. In this paper, we combine both ideas and develop a variant of the AO* algorithm for performing forward heuristic search in hierarchical models. This algorithm shows great performance improvements over hierarchical approaches using standard MDP solvers such as Value Iteration, as well as with respect to AO applied to a flat representation of the problem. Moreover, it presents a general new method for accelerating AO and other forward search algorithms. Substantial performance gains may be obtained in these algorithms by partitioning the set of search nodes, and solving a subset of nodes completely before propagating the results to other subsets.|Nicolas Meuleau,Ronen I.

Neuroscientific studies suggest that controlled and automatic processing rely on two largely distinct neural pathways. The controlled pathway, which includes the prefrontal cortex, is seen as acquiring declarative representations of skills. In comparison, the automatic pathway is thought to develop procedural representations. Automaticity in motor skill learning involves a reduction in dependence on frontal systems and an increased reliance on the automatic pathway. In this paper, we propose a biologically plausible computational model of motor skill automaticity. This model offers a dual-pathway neurocomputational account of the translation of declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge during motor learning. In support of the model, we review some previously reported human experimental results involving the learning of a sequential key pressing task, and we demonstrate, through simulation, howthe model provides a parsimonious explanation for these results.|Ashish Gupta,David C.

Our approach is able to build an inner box for the problem starting with a single point solution, by consistently extending the domain of every variable. The key point is a new method called generalized projection. The requirements are that each parameter must occur only once in the system, variable domains must be bounded, and each variable must occur only once in each constraint.

They determine the neighborhood graph using Euclidean distance so that they often fail to nicely deal with sparsely sampled or noise contaminated data. This paper applies the graph algebra to optimize the neighborhood structure for Isomap. The improved Isomap outperforms the classic Isomap in visualization and time complexity, as it provides good neighborhood structure that can speed up the subsequent dimensionality reducing process. It also has stronger topological stability and less sensitive to parameters. This indicates that the more complicated or even time-consuming approaches can be applied to construct the better neighborhood structure whilst the whole time complexity will not raise.

This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting.

One way of accomplishing learning is to observe past outcomes, using such information to improve future decisions. When limits in agents' memory or observation capabilities are assumed, one must decide on how large should the observation window be. We investigate how this decision influences both agents' and system's performance in the context of a special class of distributed resource allocation problems, namely dispersion games. We show by numerical experiments over a specific dispersion game (the Minority Game) that in such scenario an agent's performance is non-monotonically correlated with her memory size when all other agents are kept unchanged.

The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

It has been shown in the literature that the point of convergence and motion of a swarm of autonomous mobile agents can be controlled by using cyclic pursuit laws. In cyclic pursuit, there exists a predefined cyclic connection between agents and each agent pursues the next agent in the cycle. In this paper we generalize this idea to a case where an agent pursues a point which is the weighted average of the positions of the remaining agents. This point correspond to a particular pursuit sequence. Using this concept of centroidal cyclic pursuit, the behavior of the agents is analyzed such that, by suitably selecting the agents' gain, the rendezvous point of the agents can be controlled, directed linear motion of the agents can be achieved, and the trajectories of the agents can be changed by switching between the pursuit sequences keeping some of the behaviors of the agents invariant.

The idea is to learn a local predictor using standard methods, such as logistic regression or support vector machines, but then achieve improved structured classification by \"boosting\" the influence of misclassified components after structured prediction, re-training the local predictor, and repeating. Further improvement in structured prediction accuracy can be achieved by incorporating \"dynamic\" features--i.e. an extension whereby the features for one predicted component can depend on the predictions already made for some other components. We apply our techniques to the problem of learning dependency parsers from annotated natural language corpora. By using logistic regression as an efficient base classifier (for predicting dependency links between word pairs), we are able to efficiently train a dependency parsing model, via structured boosting, that achieves state of the art results in English, and surpasses state of the art in Chinese.|Qin Iris Wang,Dekang Lin,Dale Schuurmans","16708|IJCAI|2007|Metric Properties of Structured Data Visualizations through Generative Probabilistic Modeling|Recently, generative probabilistic modeling principles were extended to visualization of structured data types, such as sequences.

The motivation for this assumption stems from inherent spitefulness or, for example, from competitive scenarios such as in closed markets where the loss of a competitor will likely result in future gains for oneself. We derive symmetric Bayes Nash equilibria for spiteful agents in st-price and nd-price sealedbid auctions. In st-price auctions, bidders become \"more truthful\" the more spiteful they are. Surprisingly, the equilibrium strategy in nd-price auctions does not depend on the number of bidders. Based on these equilibria, we compare the revenue in both auction types. It turns out that expected revenue in nd-price auctions is higher than expected revenue in st-price auctions in the case of even the most modestly spiteful agents, provided they still care at least at little for their own profit. In other words, revenue equivalence only holds for auctions in which all agents are either self-interested or completely malicious. We furthermore investigate the impact of common knowledge on spiteful bidding. Divulging the bidders' valuations reduces revenue in nd-price auctions, whereas it has the opposite effect in st-price auctions.|Felix Brandt,Tuomas Sandholm,Yoav Shoham","16781|IJCAI|2007|Providing a Recommended Trading Agent to a Population A Novel Approach|This paper presents a novel approach for providing automated trading agents to a population, focusing on bilateral negotiation with unenforceable agreements.

We draw on a recent framework for \"structured output classification\" (e.g. syntactic parsing) known as learning as search optimization (LaSO). The LaSO approach uses discriminative learning to optimize heuristic functions for search-based computation of structured outputs and has shown promising results in a number of domains. However, the search problems that arise in AI planning tend to be qualitatively very different from those considered in structured classification, which raises a number of potential difficulties in directly applying LaSO to planning. In this paper, we discuss these issues and describe a LaSO-based approach for discriminative learning of beam-search heuristics in AI planning domains. We give convergence results for this approach and present experiments in several benchmark domains. The results show that the discriminatively trained heuristic can outperform the one used by the planner FF and another recent non-discriminative learning approach.|Yuehua Xu,Alan Fern,Sung Wook Yoon"]]},"title":{"entropy":6.066151531347435,"topics":["for planning, the, markov processes, description logic, markov decision, logic programs, decision processes, for logic, language and, and the, with preferences, logic programming, the web, web search, the problems, for decision, planning, logic, programming for, for reasoning","for learning, learning, reinforcement learning, word sense, sense disambiguation, word disambiguation, study the, distributed optimization, transfer learning, new for, learning and, learning from, machine learning, learning the, for auctions, for constraint, semi-supervised learning, relational learning, representations for, framework for","gaussian process, mobile robot, bayesian networks, using, using conditional, image using, using graph, using and, using bayesian, from using, networks, from, automatic, boosting, detection, ranking, training, classification, structured, tree","algorithm for, model for, for, heuristic search, for based, multi-agent systems, local search, feature for, using semantic, for and, for networks, inference for, fast algorithm, adaptation for, and online, for programs, model based, search, fast for, for systems","and the, for and, the for, language and, the problems, the constraint, and, computation, under, incremental, solutions, goal","for logic, markov processes, for decision, description logic, markov decision, logic programs, decision processes, logic, temporal, algorithm, towards","for and, representations for, and, state, observation, partial, techniques, qualitative","new for, distributed optimization, for constraint, for problems, for agents, for learning, agents, selection, action, autonomous, real-time, algorithm, for","gaussian process, using bayesian, bayesian networks, networks, structured, dynamic, knowledge, with","using, using conditional, data, classification, detection, the","semantic, domains, improving, hierarchical, structure, stochastic, anytime","for and, and online, inference for, for, online for, kernel for, for markov, generation"],"ranking":[["16719|IJCAI|2007|Average-Reward Decentralized Markov Decision Processes|Formal analysis of decentralized decision making has become a thriving research area in recent years, producing a number of multi-agent extensions of Markov decision processes.

In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.|Janusz Marecki,Sven Koenig,Milind Tambe","16759|IJCAI|2007|Using Linear Programming for Bayesian Exploration in Markov Decision Processes|A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge. Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming.

We extend the Probably Approximately Correct semantics to the case of learning from partial observations with arbitrarily hidden attributes. We establish that simply requiring learned hypotheses to be consistent with observed values suffices to guarantee that hidden values are recoverable to a certain accuracy we also show that, in some sense, this is an optimal strategy for achieving accurate recovery. We then establish that a number of natural concept classes, including all the classes of monotone formulas that are PAC learnable by monotone formulas, and the classes of conjunctions, disjunctions, k-CNF, k-DNF, and linear thresholds, are consistently learnable from partial observations. We finally show that the concept classes of parities and monotone term -decision lists are not properly consistently learnable from partial observations, if RP  NP. This implies a separation of what is consistently learnable from partial observations versus what is learnable in the complete or noisy setting.|Loizos Michael","16726|IJCAI|2007|Combining Learning and Word Sense Disambiguation for Intelligent User Profiling|Understanding user interests from text documents can provide support to personalized information recommendation services. Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16661|IJCAI|2007|An Experts Algorithm for Transfer Learning|A long-lived agent continually faces new tasks in its environment.

In a multi-agent environment where  or more individual plans can be executing at any one time, automation is required to support model anomaly detection, evaluation and revision. We provide an agent-based algorithm that generates hypotheses about the cause of plan anomalies. This algorithm leverages historical plan data and a hierarchy of models in a novel integration of hypothesis generation and verification. Because many hypotheses can be generated by the software agents, we provide a mechanism where only the most important hypotheses are presented to a user as suggestions for model repair.|Alice M.

However, in these similarity measures no assumption is made about the probability distributions and the local relevances of the feature vectors. Therefore, irrelevant features might hurt retrieval performance. Probabilistic approaches have proven to be an effective solution to this CBIR problem. In this paper, we use a Bayesian logistic regression model, in order to compute the weights of a pseudo-metric to improve its discriminatory capacity and then to increase image retrieval accuracy. The pseudo-metric weights were adjusted by the classical logistic regression model in Ksantini et al., . The Bayesian logistic regression model was shown to be a significantly better tool than the classical logistic regression one to improve the retrieval performance. The retrieval method is fast and is based on feature selection. Experimental results are reported on the Zubud and WANG color image databases proposed by Deselaers et al., .|Riadh Ksantini,Djemel Ziou,Bernard Colin,Fran√ßois Dubeau","16793|IJCAI|2007|Automated Benchmark Model Generators for Model-Based Diagnostic Inference|The task of model-based diagnosis is NP-complete, but it is not known whether it is computationally difficult for the \"average\" real-world system.

Researchers are investigating ever-more efficient algorithms, yet many applications demand such algorithms bound any loss in policy quality when chasing efficiency. To address this challenge, we present two new techniques. The first approximates in the value space to obtain solutions efficiently for a pre-specified error bound. Unlike existing techniques, our technique guarantees the resulting policy will meet this bound. Furthermore, it does not require costly computations to determine the quality loss of the policy. Our second technique prunes large tracts of belief space that are unreachable, allowing faster policy computation without any sacrifice in optimality. The combination of the two techniques, which are complementary to existing optimal policy generation algorithms, provides solutions with tight error bounds efficiently in domains where competing algorithms fail to provide such tight bounds.|Pradeep Varakantham,Rajiv T.

To guide the forward planning search, we introduce a novel heuristic framework that combines costpropagation and Integer Programming to select beneficial goals to find an informative heuristic estimate. The two implemented planners, iPUD and SPUDS, using the approaches discussed above, are compared empirically on several benchmark domains. While iPUD is more readily amendable to handle goal utility dependencies and can provide bounded optimality guarantees, SPUDS scales much better.|Minh Binh Do,J.

In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming.

Recently multiagent researchers have adopted the CTMS language as a standard for multiagent task scheduling. We contribute an automated mapping that transforms CTMS into a DCOP. Further, we propose a set of representational compromises for CTMS that allow existing distributed algorithms for DCOP to be immediately brought to bear on CTMS problems. Next, we demonstrate a key advantage of a constraint based representation is the ability to leverage the representation to do efficient solving. We contribute a set of pre-processing algorithms that leverage existing constraint propagation techniques to do variable domain pruning on the DCOP. We show that these algorithms can result in % reduction in state space size for a given set of CTMS problems. Finally, we demonstrate up to a % increase in the ability to optimally solve CTMS problems in a reasonable amount of time and in a distributed manner as a result of applying our mapping and domain pruning algorithms.|Evan Sultanik,Pragnesh Jay Modi,William C.

Because complete algorithms to solve DCOPs are unsuitable for some dynamic or anytime domains, researchers have explored incomplete DCOP algorithms that result in locally optimal solutions.

Our analysis utilizes a normative account of privacy that defends its value and the extent to which it should be protected privacy is treated as an interest with moral value, to supplement the legal claim that privacy is a legal right worthy of protection by society and the law. We argue that the fact that the only entity to access my personal data (such as email) is an artificial agent is irrelevant to whether a breach of privacy has occurred. What is relevant are the capacities of the agent what the agent is both able and empowered to do with that information. We show how concepts of legal agency and attribution of knowledge gained by agents to their principals are crucial to understanding whether a violation of privacy has occurred when artificial agents access users' personal data. As natural language processing and semantic extraction used in artificial agents become increasingly sophisticated, so the corporations that deploy those agents will be more likely to be attributed with knowledge of their users' personal information, thus triggering significant potential legal liabilities.|Samir Chopra,Laurence White"],["16489|IJCAI|2007|A Theoretical Framework for Learning Bayesian Networks with Parameter Inequality Constraints|The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data.

Domain knowledge about the conditional independence relationships among variables can help learning of the Bayesian Network structure.

However, the development of SANNs has traditionally focused on data domains that are assumed to be modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of data governed by other statistical models, such as the Poisson distribution, has received less attention from the data mining community. Based on special considerations of the statistical nature of data following a Poisson distribution, this paper introduces a SANN, Poisson-based Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (PSOTA), which implements novel similarity matching criteria and neuron weight adaptation schemes. It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood. This study indicate that, in comparison to the traditional Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA), PSOTA offers significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization in data modeled by the Poisson distribution, such as serial analysis of gene expression data.|Haiying Wang,Huiru Zheng,Francisco Azuaje","16792|IJCAI|2007|Efficient Failure Detection on Mobile Robots Using Particle Filters with Gaussian Process Proposals|The ability to detect failures and to analyze their causes is one of the preconditions of truly autonomous mobile robots.

The MLF may have exponential computational complexity, but our ZBDD-based data structure provides a compact factored form of the MLF, and arithmetic operations can be executed in a time almost linear with the ZBDD size. In our method, it is not necessary to generate the MLF for the whole network, as we can extract MLFs for only part of the network related to the query, avoiding unnecessary calculation of redundant MLF terms.

In principle, system models can be compiled into a tractable representation (such as DNNF) on which faults of arbitrary cardinality can be found efficiently. For large circuits, however, compilation can become a bottleneck due to the large number of variables necessary to model the health of individual gates. We propose a novel method that greatly reduces this number, allowing the compilation, as well as the diagnosis, to scale to larger circuits. The basic idea is to identify regions of a circuit, called cones, that are dominated by single gates, and model the health of each cone with a single health variable. When a cone is found to be possibly faulty, we diagnose it by again identifying the cones inside it, and so on, until we reach a base case. We show that results combined from these hierarchical sessions are sound and complete with respect to minimum-cardinality diagnoses.

However, through the use of an evolutionary simulation, we extend the analytical results beyond the two-seller case, and we then show that these inefficiencies can be effectively reduced when the mediating auction institution uses auction fees based on the difference between the auction closing and reserve prices.|Enrico H.

Jennings","16658|IJCAI|2007|AEMS An Anytime Online Search Algorithm for Approximate Policy Refinement in Large POMDPs|Solving large Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) is a complex task which is often intractable. A lot of effort has been made to develop approximate offline algorithms to solve ever larger POMDPs. However, even state-of-the-art approaches fail to solve large POMDPs in reasonable time. Recent developments in online POMDP search suggest that combining offline computations with online computations is often more efficient and can also considerably reduce the error made by approximate policies computed offline. In the same vein, we propose a new anytime online search algorithm which seeks to minimize, as efficiently as possible, the error made by an approximate value function computed offline. In addition, we show how previous online computations can be reused in following time steps in order to prevent redundant computations. Our preliminary results indicate that our approach is able to tackle large state space and observation space efficiently and under real-time constraints.|St√©phane Ross,Brahim Chaib-draa","16442|IJCAI|2007|Performance Analysis of Online Anticipatory Algorithms for Large Multistage Stochastic Integer Programs|Despite significant algorithmic advances in recent years, finding optimal policies for large-scale, multistage stochastic combinatorial optimization problems remains far beyond the reach of existing methods. This paper studies a complementary approach, online anticipatory algorithms, that make decisions at each step by solving the anticipatory relaxation for a polynomial number of scenarios. Online anticipatory algorithms have exhibited surprisingly good results on a variety of applications and this paper aims at understanding their success. In particular, the paper derives sufficient conditions under which online anticipatory algorithms achieve good expected utility and studies the various types of errors arising in the algorithms including the anticipativity and sampling errors. The sampling error is shown to be negligible with a logarithmic number of scenarios. The anticipativity error is harder to bound and is shown to be low, both theoretically and experimentally, for the existing applications.|Luc Mercier,Pascal Van Hentenryck","16418|IJCAI|2007|Detect and Track Latent Factors with Online Nonnegative Matrix Factorization|Detecting and tracking latent factors from temporal data is an important task. Most existing algorithms for latent topic detection such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) have been designed for static data. These algorithms are unable to capture the dynamic nature of temporally changing data streams. In this paper, we put forward an online NMF (ONMF) algorithm to detect latent factors and track their evolution while the data evolve. By leveraging the already detected latent factors and the newly arriving data, the latent factors are automatically and incrementally updated to reflect the change of factors. Furthermore, by imposing orthogonality on the detected latent factors, we can not only guarantee the unique solution of NMF but also alleviate the partial-data problem, which may cause NMF to fail when the data are scarce or the distribution is incomplete. Experiments on both synthesized data and real data validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our ONMF algorithm.|Bin Cao,Dou Shen,Jian-Tao Sun,Xuanhui Wang,Qiang Yang,Zheng Chen","16603|IJCAI|2007|Extracting Chatbot Knowledge from Online Discussion Forums|This paper presents a novel approach for extracting high-quality thread-title, reply pairs as chat knowledge from online discussion forums so as to efficiently support the construction of a chatbot for a certain domain. Given a forum, the high-quality thread-title, reply pairs are extracted using a cascaded framework. First, the replies logically relevant to the thread title of the root message are extracted with an SVM classifier from all the replies, based on correlations such as structure and content. Then, the extracted thread-title, reply pairs are ranked with a ranking SVM based on their content qualities. Finally, the Top-N thread-title, reply pairs are selected as chatbot knowledge. Results from experiments conducted within a movie forum show the proposed approach is effective.|Jizhou Huang,Ming Zhou,Dan Yang","16491|IJCAI|2007|Extracting and Visualizing Trust Relationships from Online Auction Feedback Comments|Buyers and sellers in online auctions are faced with the task of deciding who to entrust their business to based on a very limited amount of information.

Contrary to earlier algorithms which only move vehicles to known customers, this paper investigates waiting and relocation strategies in which vehicles may wait at their current location or relocate to arbitrary sites. Experimental results show that waiting and relocation strategies may dramatically improve customer service, especially for problems that are highly dynamic and contain many late requests. The decisions to wait and to relocate do not exploit any problem-specific features but rather are obtained by including choices in the online algorithm that are necessarily sub-optimal in an offline setting.|Russell Bent,Pascal Van Hentenryck","16654|IJCAI|2007|Online Speed Adaptation Using Supervised Learning for High-Speed Off-Road Autonomous Driving|The mobile robotics community has traditionally addressed motion planning and navigation in terms of steering decisions. However, selecting the best speed is also important - beyond its relationship to stopping distance and lateral maneuverability. Consider a high-speed ( mph) autonomous vehicle driving off-road through challenging desert terrain. The vehicle should drive slowly on terrain that poses substantial risk. However, it should not dawdle on safe terrain. In this paper we address one aspect of risk - shock to the vehicle. We present an algorithm for trading-off shock and speed in realtime and without human intervention. The trade-off is optimized using supervised learning to match human driving. The learning process is essential due to the discontinuous and spatially correlated nature of the control problem - classical techniques do not directly apply. We evaluate performance over hundreds of miles of autonomous driving, including performance during the  DARPA Grand Challenge. This approach was the deciding factor in our vehicle's speed for nearly % of the DARPA competition - more than any other constraint except the DARPA-imposed speed limits - and resulted in the fastest finishing time.|David Stavens,Gabriel Hoffmann,Sebastian Thrun","16474|IJCAI|2007|Kernel Carpentry for Online Regression Using Randomly Varying Coefficient Model|We present a Bayesian formulation of locally weighted learning (LWL) using the novel concept of a randomly varying coefficient model. Based on this, we propose a mechanism for multivariate non-linear regression using spatially localised linear models that learns completely independent of each other, uses only local information and adapts the local model complexity in a data driven fashion. We derive online updates for the model parameters based on variational Bayesian EM. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm against other state-of-the-art methods reveal the excellent, robust generalization performance beside surprisingly efficient time and space complexity properties. This paper, for the first time, brings together the computational efficiency and the adaptability of 'non-competitive' locally weighted learning schemes and the modelling guarantees of the Bayesian formulation.|Narayanan U.
