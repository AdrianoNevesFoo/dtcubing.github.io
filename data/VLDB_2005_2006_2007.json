This technology poses many new challenges on current data management systems. RFID data are time-dependent, dynamically changing, in large volumes, and carry implicit semantics. RFID data management systems need to effectively support such large scale temporal data created by RFID applications. These systems need to have an explicit temporal data model for RFID data to support tracking and monitoring queries. In addition, they need to have an automatic method to transform the primitive observations from RFID readers into derived data used in RFID-enabled applications. In this paper, we present an integrated RFID data management system -- Siemens RFID Middleware -- based on an expressive temporal data model for RFID data. Our system enables semantic RFID data filtering and automatic data transformation based on declarative rules, provides powerful query support of RFID object tracking and monitoring, and can be adapted to different RFID-enabled applications.|Fusheng Wang,Peiya Liu","80761|VLDB|2007|Computer Science  A New World of Data Management|Data management, one of the most successful software technologies, is the bedrock of almost all business, government, and scientific activities, worldwide. Data management continues to grow, more than doubling in data and transaction volumes every two years with a growth in deployments to fuel a $ billion market. A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications. While data management growth will continue based primarily on the relational data model and conventional DBMSs, a much larger and more challenging data management world is emerging. In the 's data under DBMS management reached % of the world's data. The six-fold growth of non-relational data in the period -- will reduce that number to well below %. We are entering the next generation of computing with a fundamentally different computing model and paradigm characterized technologically by multi-core architectures, virtualization, service-oriented computing, and the semantic web. Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities. Missing this opportunity will be worse than missing the Internet. The semantic web will become the means by which information is accessed and managed with modest projections of  billion pages with hundreds of triples per page - the largest distributed system in the world - the only one.

What does the database community think Semantic web services will constitute a programming model of Computer Science .. How does data management fit into this semantically rich environment Computer Science . offers the data management community one of the biggest challenges in its forty-year history and opens up a new world of data management. Key to success in this new world will be collaboration with other disciplines whether at the technical level - partnering with the semantic technologies community to augment their reasoning capabilities with systems support - or at the problem solving level - partnering with real world domains as proposed by the new discipline of Web Science.|Michael L.

To handle these files data processing logic is reinvented inside each application. This results in a jungle of data processing solutions and a jungle of data and file formats. For a user, it is extremely hard to manage information in this jungle. Most of all it is impossible to use data distributed among different files and formats for combined queries, e.g., join and union operations. To solve the problems arising from file based data management, we present a software system called iMeMex as a unified solution to personal information management and integration. iMeMex is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Our system enables existing applications to gradually dispose file based storage. By using iMeMex modern operating systems are enabled to make use of sophisticated DBMS, IR and data integration technologies. The seamless integration of iMeMex into existing operating systems enables new applications that provide concepts of data storage and analysis unseen before.|Jens-Peter Dittrich,Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles,Donald Kossmann,Lukas Blunschi","80537|VLDB|2005|A Heartbeat Mechanism and Its Application in Gigascope|Data stream management systems often rely on ordering properties of tuple attributes in order to implement non-blocking operators. However, query operators that work with multiple streams, such as stream merge or join, can often still block if one of the input stream is very slow or bursty. In principle, punctuation and heartbeat mechanisms have been proposed to unblock streaming operators. In practice, it is a challenge to incorporate such mechanisms into a high-performance stream management system that is operational in an industrial application.In this paper, we introduce a system for punctuation-carrying heartbeat generation that we developed for Gigascope, a high-performance streaming database for network monitoring, that is operationally used within AT&T's IP backbone. We show how heartbeats can be regularly generated by low-level nodes in query execution plans and propagated upward unblocking all streaming operators on its way. Additionally, our heartbeat mechanism can be used for other applications in distributed settings such as detecting node failures, performance monitoring, and query optimization. A performance evaluation using live data feeds shows that our system is capable of working at multiple Gigabit line speeds in a live, industrial deployment and can significantly decrease the query memory utilization.|Theodore Johnson,S.

However, traditional information retrieval techniques are likely to be expensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized. Our performance evaluation using the INEX data set in the Quark  open-source XML database system indicates that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient.|Feng Shao,Lin Guo,Chavdar Botev,Anand Bhaskar,Muthiah Chettiar,Fan Yang 0002,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram","80696|VLDB|2006|Efficient Scheduling of Heterogeneous Continuous Queries|Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) typically host multiple Continuous Queries (CQ) that process streams of data.

We show that unlike standard on-line systems, scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will be different than policies that optimize for average slowdown which is more appropriate metric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. We also propose a hybrid scheduling policy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness. We further discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploit sharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs. Finally, we experimentally show using real data that our policies outperform currently used ones.|Mohamed A. Sharaf,Panos K.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs. It is also robust and bears negligible computational overhead.|Yi-Cheng Tu,Song Liu,Sunil Prabhakar,Bin Yao"],["80675|VLDB|2006|Efficient XSLT Processing in Relational Database System|Efficient processing of XQuery, XPath and SQLXML on XML documents stored and managed in RDBMS has been widely studied. However, much less of such type of work has been done for efficient XSLT processing of XML documents stored and managed by the database. This is partially due to the observation that the rule based template driven XSLT execution model does not fit nicely with the traditional declarative query language processing model which leverages index probing and iterator based pull mode that can be scaled to handle large size data. In this paper, we share our experience of efficient processing of XSLT in Oracle XML DB. We present the technique of processing XSLT efficiently in database by rewriting XSLT stylesheets into highly efficient XQuery through partially evaluating XSLT over the XML documents structural information. Consequently, we can leverage all the work done for efficient XQueryXPath processing in database to achieve combined optimisations of XSLT with XQueryXPath and SQLXML in Oracle XMLDB. This effectively makes XSLT processing scale to large size XML documents using classical declarative query processing techniques in DBMS.|Zhen Hua Liu,Anguel Novoselsky","80757|VLDB|2007|On the Production of Anorexic Plan Diagrams|A \"plan diagram\" is a pictorial enumeration of the execution plan choices of a database query optimizer over the relational selectivity space. We have shown recently that, for industrial-strength database engines, these diagrams are often remarkably complex and dense, with a large number of plans covering the space. However, they can often be reduced to much simpler pictures, featuring significantly fewer plans, without materially affecting the query processing quality. Plan reduction has useful implications for the design and usage of query optimizers, including quantifying redundancy in the plan search space, enhancing useability of parametric query optimization, identifying error-resistant and least-expected-cost plans, and minimizing the overheads of multi-plan approaches. We investigate here the plan reduction issue from theoretical, statistical and empirical perspectives. Our analysis shows that optimal plan reduction, w.r.t. minimizing the number of plans, is an NP-hard problem in general, and remains so even for a storage-constrained variant. We then present a greedy reduction algorithm with tight and optimal performance guarantees, whose complexity scales linearly with the number of plans in the diagram for a given resolution. Next, we devise fast estimators for locating the best tradeoff between the reduction in plan cardinality and the impact on query processing quality. Finally, extensive experimentation with a suite of multi-dimensional TPCH-based query templates on industrial-strength optimizers demonstrates that complex plan diagrams easily reduce to \"anorexic\" (small absolute number of plans) levels incurring only marginal increases in the estimated query processing costs.|Harish D.,Pooja N.

In this paper, we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology and cognition science to database query answering, and study the novel problem of answering top-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical NBA players\", the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players\", the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is often too costly for online query answering on large databases. We develop a series of approximation methods for various situations. () The randomized tournament algorithm has linear complexity though it does not provide a theoretical guarantee on the quality of the answers.

Then, typicality queries can be answered efficiently with quality guarantees by a tournament method based on a Local Typicality Tree data structure.

In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections.

Given a database, an object belongs to the skyline if it cannot be dominated with respect to the given attributes by any other database object.

However, objects can also have spatial attributes like x, y coordinates which can be used to represent relevant constraints on the query results.

Such queries support a micro-economic approach to decision making, considering not only the quality but also the cost of solutions. We investigate two alternative approaches for efficient query processing, a symmetrical one based on off-the-shelf index structures, and an asymmetrical one based on index structures with special purpose extensions.

At first, we consider for a multidimensional data set P the problem of dynamic skyline queries according to a query point q. This kind of dynamic skyline corresponds to the skyline of a transformed data space where point q becomes the origin and all points of P are represented by their distance vector to q. The reverse skyline query returns the objects whose dynamic skyline contains the query object q. In order to compute the reverse skyline of an arbitrary query point, we first propose a Branch and Bound algorithm (called BBRS), which is an improved customization of the original BBS algorithm. Furthermore, we identify a super set of the reverse skyline that is used to bound the search space while computing the reverse skyline. To further reduce the computational cost of determining if a point belongs to the reverse skyline, we propose an enhanced algorithm (called RSSA) that is based on accurate pre-computed approximations of the skylines. These approximations are used to identify whether a point belongs to the reverse skyline or not. Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets, we show that our algorithms can efficiently support reverse skyline queries. Our enhanced approach improves reversed skyline processing by up to an order of magnitude compared to the algorithm without the usage of pre-computed approximations.|Evangelos Dellis,Bernhard Seeger","80639|VLDB|2006|Answering Top-k Queries Using Views|The problem of obtaining efficient answers to top-k queries has attracted a lot of research attention.

The general form of this problem requests the k highest ranked values from a relation, using monotone combining functions on (a subset of) its attributes.In this paper we explore space performance tradeoffs related to this problem. In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries. We then address the problem of identifying the most promising (in terms of performance) views to use for query answering in the presence of a collection of views. We formalize both problems and present efficient algorithms for their solution.

We define a rank-aware measure for the cube, capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional ranking analysis. Based on the ranking cube, an efficient query algorithm is developed which progressively retrieves data blocks until the top-k results are found. The curse of dimensionality is a well-known challenge for the data cube and we cope with this difficulty by introducing a new technique of ranking fragments.

A significant and important subset of this general model relevant to real-world applications include queries where the optimization function and constraints are convex. We cast such queries as members of the convex optimization (CP) model and provide a unified query processing framework for CP queries that IO optimally accesses data and space partitioning index structures without changing the underlying structures. We perform experiments to show the generality of the technique and where possible, compare to techniques developed for specialized optimization queries. We find that we achieve nearly identical performance to the limited optimization query types with optimal solutions, while providing generic modeling and processing for a much broader class of queries, and while effectively handling problem constraints.|Michael Gibas,Ning Zheng,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu","80852|VLDB|2007|Efficient Processing of Top-k Dominating Queries on Multi-Dimensional Data|The top-k dominating query returns k data objects which dominate the highest number of objects in a dataset. This query is an important tool for decision support since it provides data analysts an intuitive way for finding significant objects. In addition, it combines the advantages of top-k and skyline queries without sharing their disadvantages (i) the output size can be controlled, (ii) no ranking functions need to be specified by users, and (iii) the result is independent of the scales at different dimensions. Despite their importance, top-k dominating queries have not received adequate attention from the research community. In this paper, we design specialized algorithms that apply on indexed multi-dimensional data and fully exploit the characteristics of the problem. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform a previous skyline-based approach, while our results on real datasets show the meaningfulness of top-k dominating queries.|Man Lung Yiu,Nikos Mamoulis"],["80597|VLDB|2005|Light-weight Domain-based Form Assistant Querying Web Databases On the Fly|The Web has been rapidly \"deepened\" by myriad searchable databases online, where data are hidden behind query forms. Helping users query alternative \"deep Web\" sources in the same domain (e.g., Books, Airfares) is an important task with broad applications. As a core component of those applications, dynamic query translation (i.e., translating a user's query across dynamically selected sources) has not been extensively explored. While existing works focus on isolated subproblems (e.g., schema matching, query rewriting) to study, we target at building a complete query translator and thus face new challenges ) To complete the translator, we need to solve the predicate mapping problem (i.e., map a source predicate to target predicates), which is largely unexplored by existing works ) To satisfy our application requirements, we need to design a customizable system architecture to assemble various components addressing respective subproblems (i.e., schema matching, predicate mapping, query rewriting). Tackling these challenges, we develop a light-weight domain-based form assistant, which can generally handle alternative sources in the same domain and is easily customizable to new domains.

Such evolution causes invalidation of various artifacts depending on the schemas, such as schema mappings. In a heterogenous environment, where cooperation among data sources depends essentially upon them, schema mappings must be adapted to reflect schema evolution. In this study, we explore the mapping composition approach for addressing this mapping adaptation problem. We study the semantics of mapping composition in the context of mapping adaptation and compare our approach with the incremental approach of Velegrakis et al . We show that our method is superior in terms of capturing the semantics of both the original mappings and the evolution. We design and implement a mapping adaptation system based on mapping composition as well as additional mapping pruning techniques that significantly speed up the adaptation. We conduct comprehensive experimental analysis and show that the composition approach is practical in various evolution scenarios. The mapping language that we consider is a nested relational extension of the second-order dependencies of Fagin et al . Our work can also be seen as an implementation of the mapping composition operator of the model management framework.|Cong Yu,Lucian Popa","80633|VLDB|2006|Debugging Schema Mappings with Routes|A schema mapping is a high-level declarative specification of the relationship between two schemas it specifies how data structured under one schema, called the source schema, is to be converted into data structured under a possibly different schema, called the target schema. Schema mappings are fundamental components for both data exchange and data integration. To date, a language for specifying (or programming) schema mappings exists. However, developmental support for programming schema mappings is still lacking. In particular, a tool for debugging schema mappings has not yet been developed. In this paper, we propose to build a debugger for understanding and exploring schema mappings. We present a primary feature of our debugger, called routes, that describes the relationship between source and target data with the schema mapping. We present two algorithms for computing all routes or one route for selected target data. Both algorithms execute in polynomial time in the size of the input. In computing all routes, our algorithm produces a concise representation that factors common steps in the routes. Furthermore, every minimal route for the selected data can, essentially, be found in this representation. Our second algorithm is able to produce one route fast, if there is one, and alternative routes as needed. We demonstrate the feasibility of our route algorithms through a set of experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets.|Laura Chiticariu,Wang Chiew Tan","80608|VLDB|2006|SPIDER a Schema mapPIng DEbuggeR|A schema mapping is a high-level declarative specification of how data structured under one schema, called the source schema, is to be transformed into data structured under a possibly different schema, called the target schema.

We have built SPIDER on top of a data exchange system, Clio, from IBM Almaden Research Center. At the heart of SPIDER is a data-driven facility for understanding a schema mapping through the display of routes.

Schema mappings for both relational and nested data are well-known. In this work, we present a new formalism for schema mapping that extends these existing formalisms in two significant ways. First, our nested mappings allow for nesting and correlation of mappings. This results in a natural programming paradigm that often yields more accurate specifications. In particular, we show that nested mappings can naturally preserve correlations among data that existing mapping formalisms cannot. We also show that using nested mappings for purposes of exchanging data from a source to a target will result in less redundancy in the target data. The second extension to the mapping formalism is the ability to express, in a declarative way, grouping and data merging semantics. This semantics can be easily changed and customized to the integration task at hand. We present a new algorithm for the automatic generation of nested mappings from schema matchings (that is, simple element-to-element correspondences between schemas). We have implemented this algorithm, along with algorithms for the generation of transformation queries (e.g., XQuery) based on the nested mapping specification. We show that the generation algorithms scale well to large, highly nested schemas. We also show that using nested mappings in data exchange can drastically reduce the execution cost of producing a target instance, particularly over large data sources, and can also dramatically improve the quality of the generated data.|Ariel Fuxman,Mauricio A.

We posit that data-integration systems need to handle uncertainty at three levels, and do so in a principled fashion. First, the semantic mappings between the data sources and the mediated schema may be approximate because there may be too many of them to be created and maintained or because in some domains (e.g., bioinformatics) it is not clear what the mappings should be. Second, queries to the system may be posed with keywords rather than in a structured form. Third, the data from the sources may be extracted using information extraction techniques and so may yield imprecise data. As a first step to building such a system, we introduce the concept of probabilistic schema mappings and analyze their formal foundations. We show that there are two possible semantics for such mappings by-table semantics assumes that there exists a correct mapping but we don't know what it is by-tuple semantics assumes that the correct mapping may depend on the particular tuple in the source data. We present the query complexity and algorithms for answering queries in the presence of approximate schema mappings, and we describe an algorithm for efficiently computing the top-k answers to queries in such a setting.|Xin Luna Dong,Alon Y.

Effective solutions have to be simultaneously spacetime efficient (at each remote monitor site), communication efficient (across the underlying communication network), and provide continuous, guaranteed-quality approximate query answers. In this paper, we propose novel algorithmic solutions for the problem of continuously tracking a broad class of complex aggregate queries in such a distributed-streams setting. Our tracking schemes maintain approximate query answers with provable error guarantees, while simultaneously optimizing the storage space and processing time at each remote site, and the communication cost across the network. They rely on tracking general-purpose randomized sketch summaries of local streams at remote sites along with concise prediction models of local site behavior in order to produce highly communication- and spacetime-efficient solutions. The result is a powerful approximate query tracking framework that readily incorporates several complex analysis queries (including distributed join and multi-join aggregates, and approximate wavelet representations), thus giving the first known low-overhead tracking solution for such queries in the distributed-streams model.|Graham Cormode,Minos N.

The volume of data generated by a typical RFID application will be enormous as each item will generate a complete history of all the individual locations that it occupied at every point in time, possibly from a specific production line at a given factory, passing through multiple warehouses, and all the way to a particular checkout counter in a store. The movement trails of such RFID data form gigantic commodity flowgraph representing the locations and durations of the path stages traversed by each item.

As in standard OLAP, the model will be composed of cuboids that aggregate item flows at a given abstraction level. The flowcube differs from the traditional data cube in two major ways. First, the measure of each cell will not be a scalar aggregate but a commodity flowgraph that captures the major movement trends and significant deviations of the items aggregated in the cell. Second, each flowgraph itself can be viewed at multiple levels by changing the level of abstraction of path stages.

Recently, the problem of data provenance has been increasingly addressed in database research. Earlier work has been limited to the lineage of data as it is manipulated using relational operations within an RDBMS. While this captures a very important aspect of scientific data processing, the existing work is incapable of handling the equally important, and prevalent, cases where the data is processed by non-relational operations. This is particularly common in scientific data where sophisticated processing is achieved by programs that are not part of a DBMS. The problem of tracking lineage when non-relational operators are used to process the data is particularly challenging since there is potentially no constraint on the nature of the processing. In this paper we propose a novel technique that overcomes this significant barrier and enables the tracing of lineage of data generated by an arbitrary function. Our technique works directly with the executable code of the function and does not require any high-level description of the function or even the source code. We establish the feasibility of our approach on a typical application and demonstrate that the technique is able to discern the correct lineage.

This implies that database schemas are generated out of transient programming class descriptions. The basic idea of the MDA approach generalizes this principle by providing a framework to generate applications (and database schemas) for different programming platforms. Within our GignoMDA project --which is subject of this demo proposal--we have extended classic concepts for code generation. That means, our approach provides a single point of truth describing all aspects of database applications (e.g. database schema, project documentation,...) with great potential for cross-layer optimization. These new cross-layer optimization hints are a novel way for the challenging global optimization issue of multi-tier database applications.

We propose a general class of queries, model-based optimization queries, in which a generic model is used to define a wide variety of queries involving an optimization objective function andor a set of constraints on the attributes. This model can be used to define optimization of linear and nonlinear expressions over object attributes as well as many existing query types studied in database research literature. A significant and important subset of this general model relevant to real-world applications include queries where the optimization function and constraints are convex. We cast such queries as members of the convex optimization (CP) model and provide a unified query processing framework for CP queries that IO optimally accesses data and space partitioning index structures without changing the underlying structures. We perform experiments to show the generality of the technique and where possible, compare to techniques developed for specialized optimization queries. We find that we achieve nearly identical performance to the limited optimization query types with optimal solutions, while providing generic modeling and processing for a much broader class of queries, and while effectively handling problem constraints.|Michael Gibas,Ning Zheng,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu","80481|VLDB|2005|Database Publication Practices|There has been a growing interest in improving the publication processes for database research papers.

In this paper, we share our experience of efficient processing of XSLT in Oracle XML DB. We present the technique of processing XSLT efficiently in database by rewriting XSLT stylesheets into highly efficient XQuery through partially evaluating XSLT over the XML documents structural information. Consequently, we can leverage all the work done for efficient XQueryXPath processing in database to achieve combined optimisations of XSLT with XQueryXPath and SQLXML in Oracle XMLDB.

XML is a de-facto standard for content publishing and data exchange. The proliferation of XML documents has created new challenges and opportunities for managing document collections. Existing technologies for automatically organizing document collections are either imprecise or based on only simple criteria. Since XML documents are self describing, it is now possible to automatically categorize XML documents precisely, according to their content. With the availability of the standard XML query languages, e.g. XQuery, much more powerful folder technologies are now feasible. To address this new challenge and exploit this new opportunity, this paper proposes a new and powerful dynamic folder mechanism, called Hubble. Hubble fully exploits the rich data model and semantic information embedded in the XML documents to build folder hierarchies dynamically and to categorize XML collections precisely. Besides supporting basic folder operations, Hubble also provides advanced features such as multi-path navigation and folder traversal across multiple document collections. Our performance study shows that Hubble is both efficient and scalable. Thus, it is an ideal technology for automating the process of organizing and categorizing XML documents.|Ning Li,Joshua Hui,Hui-I Hsiao,Kevin S.

While many processing methods have already been proposed for such queries, none of them has found its way to any of the existing \"lightweight\" XML engines (i.e. engines without optimization modules). The main reason is the lack of a systematic comparison of query methods under a common storage model. In this work, we aim to fill this gap and answer two important questions what the relative similarities and important differences among the tree-pattern query methods are, and if there is a prominent method among them in terms of effectiveness and robustness that an XML processor should support. For the first question, we propose a novel classification of the methods according to their matching process. We then describe a common storage model and demonstrate that the access pattern of each class conforms or can be adapted to conform to this model. Finally, we perform an experimental evaluation to compare their relative performance. Based on the evaluation results, we conclude that the family of holistic processing methods, which provides performance guarantees, is the most robust alternative for such an environment.|Mirella Moura Moro,Zografoula Vagena,Vassilis J.

With the increasing use of XML as the standard format on many Internet-based applications, XML aware pub-sub applications become necessary. In such systems, the messages (generated by publishers) are encoded as XML documents, and the profiles (defined by subscribers) as XML query statements. As the number of documents and query requests grow, the performance and scalability of the matching phase (i.e. matching of queries to incoming documents) become vital. Current solutions have limited or no flexibility to prune out queries in advance. In this paper, we overcome such limitation by proposing a novel early pruning approach called Bounding-based XML Filtering or BoXFilter. The BoXFilter is based on a new tree-like indexing structure that organizes the queries based on their similarity and provides lower and upper bound estimations needed to prune queries not related to the incoming documents.

We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical NBA players\", the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players\", the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is often too costly for online query answering on large databases. We develop a series of approximation methods for various situations.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries.

The combined score function is usually linear. To efficiently answer top-k queries, preprocessing and indexing the data have been used to speed up the run time performance. Many indexing methods allow the online query algorithms progressively retrieve the data and stop at a certain point. However, in many cases, the number of data accesses is sensitive to the query parameters (i.e., linear weights in the score functions).In this paper, we study the sequentially layered indexing problem where tuples are put into multiple consecutive layers and any top-k query can be answered by at most k layers of tuples. We propose a new criterion for building the layered index. A layered index is robust if for any k, the number of tuples in the top k layers is minimal in comparison with all the other alternatives. The robust index guarantees the worst case performance for arbitrary query parameters. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for robust index. The problem is shown solvable within O(ndlog n) (where d is the number of dimensions, and n is the number of tuples). To reduce the high complexity of the exact solution, we develop an approximate approach, which has time complexity O(d n(log n)r(d)-), where r(d)  d + d d.

In this paper, we study the problem of estimating selectivities of fuzzy string predicates. We develop a novel technique, called SEPIA, to solve the problem. It groups strings into clusters, builds a histogram structure for each cluster, and constructs a global histogram for the database. It is based on the following intuition given a query string q, a preselected string p in a cluster, and a string s in the cluster, based on the proximity between q and p, and the proximity between p and s, we can obtain a probability distribution from a global histogram about the similarity between q and s. We give a full specification of the technique using the edit distance function. We study challenges in adopting this technique, including how to construct the histogram structures, how to use them to do selectivity estimation, and how to alleviate the effect of non-uniform errors in the estimation.

The increasing popularity of this query paradigm has led to the introduction of specialized rank join operators that integrate the selection of top tuples with join processing. These operators access just \"enough\" of the input in order to generate just \"enough\" output and can offer significant speed-ups for query evaluation. The number of input tuples that an operator accesses is called the input depth of the operator, and this is the driving cost factor in rank join processing. This introduces the important problem of depth estimation, which is crucial for the costing of rank join operators during query compilation and thus for their integration in optimized physical plans. We introduce an estimation methodology, termed Deep, for approximating the input depths of rank join operators in a physical execution plan. At the core of Deep lies a general, principled framework that formalizes depth computation in terms of the joint distribution of scores in the base tables. This framework results in a systematic estimation methodology that takes the characteristics of the data directly into account and thus enables more accurate estimates. We develop novel estimation algorithms that provide an efficient realization of the formal Deep framework, and describe their integration on top of the statistics module of an existing query optimizer. We validate the performance of Deep with an extensive experimental study on data sets of varying characteristics. The results verify the effectiveness of Deep as an estimation method and demonstrate its advantages over previously proposed techniques.|Karl Schnaitter,Joshua Spiegel,Neoklis Polyzotis","80718|VLDB|2006|Answering Top-k Queries with Multi-Dimensional Selections The Ranking Cube Approach|Observed in many real applications, a top-k query often consists of two components to reflect a user's preference a selection condition and a ranking function.

In many cases, a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results.

We define a rank-aware measure for the cube, capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional ranking analysis. Based on the ranking cube, an efficient query algorithm is developed which progressively retrieves data blocks until the top-k results are found.

In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries.

A large portion of the unbiased sample may become less relevant over time because of evolution. An analytical or mining task (eg. query estimation) which is specific to only the sample points from a recent time-horizon may provide a very inaccurate result. This is because the size of the relevant sample reduces with the horizon itself. On the other hand, this is precisely the most important case for data stream algorithms, since recent history is frequently analyzed. In such cases, we show that an effective solution is to bias the sample with the use of temporal bias functions. The maintenance of such a sample is non-trivial, since it needs to be dynamically maintained, without knowing the total number of points in advance. We prove some interesting theoretical properties of a large class of memory-less bias functions, which allow for an efficient implementation of the sampling algorithm. We also show that the inclusion of bias in the sampling process introduces a maximum requirement on the reservoir size. This is a nice property since it shows that it may often be possible to maintain the maximum relevant sample with limited storage requirements. We not only illustrate the advantages of the method for the problem of query estimation, but also show that the approach has applicability to broader data mining problems such as evolution analysis and classification.|Charu C.

Although a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data and answering some types of queries on uncertain data, how to conduct advanced analysis on uncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper, we tackle the problem of skyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all the objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p. Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop two efficient algorithms. The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.|Jian Pei,Bin Jiang,Xuemin Lin,Yidong Yuan","80809|VLDB|2007|A Bayesian Method for Guessing the Extreme Values in a Data Set|For a large number of data management problems, it would be very useful to be able to obtain a few samples from a data set, and to use the samples to guess the largest (or smallest) value in the entire data set. Minmax online aggregation, top-k query processing, outlier detection, and distance join are just a few possible applications. This paper details a statistically rigorous, Bayesian approach to attacking this problem. Just as importantly, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by showing how it can be applied to two specific problems that arise in the context of data management.|Mingxi Wu,Chris Jermaine","80813|VLDB|2007|Efficient Computation of Reverse Skyline Queries|In this paper, for the first time, we introduce the concept of Reverse Skyline Queries. At first, we consider for a multidimensional data set P the problem of dynamic skyline queries according to a query point q. This kind of dynamic skyline corresponds to the skyline of a transformed data space where point q becomes the origin and all points of P are represented by their distance vector to q. The reverse skyline query returns the objects whose dynamic skyline contains the query object q. In order to compute the reverse skyline of an arbitrary query point, we first propose a Branch and Bound algorithm (called BBRS), which is an improved customization of the original BBS algorithm. Furthermore, we identify a super set of the reverse skyline that is used to bound the search space while computing the reverse skyline. To further reduce the computational cost of determining if a point belongs to the reverse skyline, we propose an enhanced algorithm (called RSSA) that is based on accurate pre-computed approximations of the skylines. These approximations are used to identify whether a point belongs to the reverse skyline or not. Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets, we show that our algorithms can efficiently support reverse skyline queries. Our enhanced approach improves reversed skyline processing by up to an order of magnitude compared to the algorithm without the usage of pre-computed approximations.|Evangelos Dellis,Bernhard Seeger","80818|VLDB|2007|Adaptive Fastest Path Computation on a Road Network A Traffic Mining Approach|Efficient fastest path computation in the presence of varying speed conditions on a large scale road network is an essential problem in modern navigation systems. Factors affecting road speed, such as weather, time of day, and vehicle type, need to be considered in order to select fast routes that match current driving conditions. Most existing systems compute fastest paths based on road Euclidean distance and a small set of predefined road speeds. However, \"History is often the best teacher\". Historical traffic data or driving patterns are often more useful than the simple Euclidean distance-based computation because people must have good reasons to choose these routes, e.g., they may want to avoid those that pass through high crime areas at night or that likely encounter accidents, road construction, or traffic jams. In this paper, we present an adaptive fastest path algorithm capable of efficiently accounting for important driving and speed patterns mined from a large set of traffic data. The algorithm is based on the following observations () The hierarchy of roads can be used to partition the road network into areas, and different path pre-computation strategies can be used at the area level, () we can limit our route search strategy to edges and path segments that are actually frequently traveled in the data, and () drivers usually traverse the road network through the largest roads available given the distance of the trip, except if there are small roads with a significant speed advantage over the large ones. Through an extensive experimental evaluation on real road networks we show that our algorithm provides desirable (short and well-supported) routes, and that it is significantly faster than competing methods.|Hector Gonzalez,Jiawei Han,Xiaolei Li,Margaret Myslinska,John Paul Sondag","80728|VLDB|2007|Mining Approximate Top-K Subspace Anomalies in Multi-Dimensional Time-Series Data|Market analysis is a representative data analysis process with many applications. In such an analysis, critical numerical measures, such as profit and sales, fluctuate over time and form time-series data. Moreover, the time series data correspond to market segments, which are described by a set of attributes, such as age, gender, education, income level, and product-category, that form a multi-dimensional structure. To better understand market dynamics and predict future trends, it is crucial to study the dynamics of time-series in multi-dimensional market segments. This is a topic that has been largely ignored in time series and data cube research. In this study, we examine the issues of anomaly detection in multi-dimensional time-series data. We propose time-series data cube to capture the multi-dimensional space formed by the attribute structure. This facilitates the detection of anomalies based on expected values derived from higher level, \"more general\" time-series. Anomaly detection in a time-series data cube poses computational challenges, especially for high-dimensional, large data sets. To this end, we also propose an efficient search algorithm to iteratively select subspaces in the original high-dimensional space and detect anomalies within each one. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution.|Xiaolei Li,Jiawei Han","80776|VLDB|2007|LCS-TRIM Dynamic Programming Meets XML Indexing and Querying|In this article, we propose a new approach for querying and indexing a database of trees with specific applications to XML datasets. Our approach relies on representing both the queries and the data using a sequential encoding and then subsequently employing an innovative variant of the longest common subsequence (LCS) matching algorithm to retrieve the desired results. A key innovation here is the use of a series of inter-linked early pruning steps, coupled with a simple index structure that enable us to reduce the search space and eliminate a large number of false positive matches prior to applying the more expensive LCS matching algorithm. Additionally, we also present mechanisms that enable the user to specify constraints on the retrieved output and show how such constraints can be pushed deep into the retrieval process, leading to improved response times. Mechanisms supporting the retrieval of approximate matches are also supported. When compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the query processing time of our algorithms is shown to be up to two to three orders of magnitude faster on several real datasets on realistic query workloads. Finally, we show that our approach is suitable for emerging multi-core server architectures when retrieving data for more expensive queries.|Shirish Tatikonda,Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Matthew Goyder","80686|VLDB|2006|Delay Aware Querying with Seaweed|Large highly distributed data sets are poorly supported by current query technologies. Applications such as endsystem-based network management are characterized by data stored on large numbers of endsystems, with frequent local updates and relatively infrequent global one-shot queries. The challenges are scale ( to  endsystems) and endsystem unavailability. In such large systems, a significant fraction of endsystems and their data will be unavailable at any given time. Existing methods to provide high data availability despite endsystem unavailability involve centralizing, redistributing or replicating the data. At large scale these methods are not scalable. We advocate a design that trades query delay for completeness, incrementally returning results as endsystems become available. We also introduce the idea of completeness prediction, which provides the user with explicit feedback about this delaycompleteness trade-off. Completeness prediction is based on replication of compact data summaries and availability models. This metadata is orders of magnitude smaller than the data. Seaweed is a scalable query infrastructure supporting incremental results, online in-network aggregation and completeness prediction. It is built on a distributed hash table (DHT) but unlike previous DHT based approaches it does not redistribute data across the network. It exploits the DHT infrastructure for failure-resilient metadata replication, query dissemination, and result aggregation. We analytically compare Seaweed's scalability against other approaches and also evaluate the Seaweed prototype running on a large-scale network simulator driven by real-world traces.|Dushyanth Narayanan,Austin Donnelly,Richard Mortier,Antony I.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

For example, a user asking about the nearest gas station has to report her exact location. With untrusted servers, reporting the location information may lead to several privacy threats. In this paper, we present Casper a new framework in which mobile and stationary users can entertain location-based services without revealing their location information. Casper consists of two main components, the location anonymizer and the privacy-aware query processor. The location anonymizer blurs the users' exact location information into cloaked spatial regions based on user-specified privacy requirements. The privacy-aware query processor is embedded inside the location-based database server in order to deal with the cloaked spatial areas rather than the exact location information. Experimental results show that Casper achieves high quality location-based services while providing anonymity for both data and queries.|Mohamed F. Mokbel,Chi-Yin Chow,Walid G.

The many tools and techniques existing today that perform this task rely usually on some dependency model of the system. However, in complex and fast evolving environments it is practically unfeasible to keep such a model up-to-date manually and it has to be created in an automatic manner. For high level objects this is in itself a challenging and less studied task. In this paper, we propose three different approaches to discover dependencies by mining system logs. Our work is inspired by a recently developed data mining algorithm and techniques for collocation extraction from the natural language processing field. We evaluate the techniques in a case study for Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and perform large-scale experiments on production data.

An immediate question then is how to answer queries on XML virtual views. A common approach is to rewrite a query on the view to an equivalent one on the underlying document, and evaluate the rewritten query. This is the approach used in the Secure MOdular Query Engine (SMOQE). The demo presents SMOQE, the first system to provide efficient support for answering queries over virtual and possibly recursively defined XML views.

We propose a general class of queries, model-based optimization queries, in which a generic model is used to define a wide variety of queries involving an optimization objective function andor a set of constraints on the attributes. This model can be used to define optimization of linear and nonlinear expressions over object attributes as well as many existing query types studied in database research literature. A significant and important subset of this general model relevant to real-world applications include queries where the optimization function and constraints are convex. We cast such queries as members of the convex optimization (CP) model and provide a unified query processing framework for CP queries that IO optimally accesses data and space partitioning index structures without changing the underlying structures. We perform experiments to show the generality of the technique and where possible, compare to techniques developed for specialized optimization queries. We find that we achieve nearly identical performance to the limited optimization query types with optimal solutions, while providing generic modeling and processing for a much broader class of queries, and while effectively handling problem constraints.|Michael Gibas,Ning Zheng,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu","80690|VLDB|2006|An Algebraic Query Model for Effective and Efficient Retrieval of XML Fragments|Finding a suitable fragment of interest in a nonschematic XML document with a simple keyword search is a complex task. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a theoretical framework with a focus on an algebraic query model having a novel query semantics. Based on this semantics, XML fragments that look meaningful to a keyword-based query are effectively retrieved by the operations defined in the model. In contrast to earlier work, our model supports filters for restricting the size of a query result, which otherwise may contain a large number of potentially irrelevant fragments. We introduce a class of filters having a special property that enables significant reduction in query processing cost. Many practically useful filters fall in this class and hence, the proposed model can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents. Several other issues regarding algebraic manipulation of the operations defined in our query model are also formally discussed.|Sujeet Pradhan","80817|VLDB|2007|Why You Should Run TPC-DS A Workload Analysis|The Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) is completing development of TPC-DS, a new generation industry standard decision support benchmark.

Unfortunately, many modern OLAP systems do not use that functionality or replicate a great deal of it in addition to other database-related functionality. In fact, the gap between the functionality provided by an OLAP system and the functionality used from the underlying database systems has widened in the past, rather than narrowed.

These features are used as keys for the patterns and stored in a B+tree. Given an XPath query, its feature vector is first calculated and looked up in the index. Then a further refinement phase is performed to fetch the final results. We experimentally study the indexing technique over both synthetic and real data sets. Our experiments show that FIX provides great pruning power and could gain an order of magnitude performance improvement for many XPath queries over existing evaluation techniques.|Ning Zhang 0002,M.

Unfortunately, it can also lead to non-serializable executions in general. Despite this, it is widely used, supported in many commercial databases, and is in fact the highest available level of consistency in Oracle and Post-greSQL. Sufficient conditions for detecting whether SI anomalies could occur in a given set of transactions were presented recently, and extended to necessary conditions for transactions without predicate reads. In this paper we address several issues in extending the earlier theory to practical detectioncorrection of anomalies. We first show how to mechanically find a set of programs which is large enough so that we ensure that all executions will be free of SI anomalies, by modifying these programs appropriately. We then address the problem of false positives, i.e., transaction programs wrongly identified as possibly leading to anomalies, and present techniques that can significantly reduce such false positives. Unlike earlier work, our techniques are designed to be automated, rather than manually carried out. We describe a tool which we are developing to carry out this task. The tool operates on descriptions of the programs either taken from the application code itself, or taken from SQL query traces. It can be used with any database system. We have used our tool on two real world applications in production use at IIT Bombay, and detected several anomalies, some of which have caused real world problems. We believe such a tool will be invaluable for ensuring safe execution of the large number of applications which are already running under SI.|Sudhir Jorwekar,Alan Fekete,Krithi Ramamritham,S.

Redundantly stored information can lead not just to a higher data storage cost, but also to increased costs for data transfer and data manipulation. Furthermore, such data redundancies can lead to potential update anomalies, rendering the database inconsistent.One way to avoid data redundancies is to employ good schema design based on known functional dependencies. In fact, several recent studies have focused on defining the notion of XML Functional Dependencies (XML FDs) to capture XML data redundancies. We observe further that XML databases are often \"casually designed\" and XML FDs may not be determined in advance. Under such circumstances, discovering XML data redundancies (in terms of FDs) from the data itself becomes necessary and is an integral part of the schema refinement process.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first system, DiscoverXFD, for effcient discovery of XML data redundancies.

One approach to monitoring such systems is to \"sniff\" these distributed logs and to store their transformed content in a DBMS. This centralizes the state and exposes it for querying unfortunately, it also creates uncertainty with respect to the recency and consistency of the data. Previous related work has focused on allowing queries to express currency and consistency constraints, which are then enforced by \"pulling\" data from the distributed sources on demand, or by requiring synchronous updates of a centralized data store. In some instances this is impossible due to legacy system issues or inefficient as the system scales to large numbers of processors. Accordingly, we propose that instead of enforcing consistency and recency, such monitoring systems should report these properties along with query results, with the hope that this will allow the data to be appropriately interpreted. We present techniques for reporting consistency and recency for queries and evaluate them with respect to efficiency and precision. Finally, we describe our prototype implementation and present experimental results of our techniques.|Jiansheng Huang,Jeffrey F.

However, comprehensive real data is often hard to come by, and there is no flexible data generation framework capable of modelling varying rich data distributions. This has led individual researchers to develop their own ad-hoc data generators for specific tasks. As a consequence, the resulting data distributions and query workloads are often hard to reproduce, analyze, and modify, thus preventing their wider usage.

Due to continuous changes in these values, and limited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), it is often infeasible for the database to store the exact values at all times. Queries that uses these old values can produce invalid results. In order to manage the uncertainty between the actual sensor value and the database value, we propose a system called U-DBMS. U-DBMS extends the database system with uncertainty management functionalities. In particular, each data value is represented as an interval and a probability distribution function, and it can be processed with probabilistic query operators to produce imprecise (but correct) answers. This demonstration presents a PostgreSQL-based system that handles uncertainty and probabilistic queries for constantly-evolving data.|Reynold Cheng,Sarvjeet Singh,Sunil Prabhakar","80542|VLDB|2005|Database-Inspired Search|\"WQL A Query Language for the WWW\", published in , presented a language with several distinctive features.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries. A thorough experimental study evaluates the efficiency of the proposed technique.|Gautam Das,Dimitrios Gunopulos,Nick Koudas,Nikos Sarkas","80791|VLDB|2007|Randomized Algorithms for Data Reconciliation in Wide Area Aggregate Query Processing|Many aspects of the data integration problem have been considered in the literature how to match schemas across different data sources, how to decide when different records refer to the same entity, how to efficiently perform the required entity resolution in a batch fashion, and so on. However, what has largely been ignored is a way to efficiently deploy these existing methods in a realistic, distributed enterprise integration environment. The straightforward use of existing methods often requires that all data be shipped to a coordinator for cleaning, which is often unacceptable.

Focusing on e-science, it can be observed that scientific experiments and observations in many fields, e. g., in physics and astronomy, create huge volumes of data which have to be interchanged and processed. With experimental and observational data coming in particular from sensors, online simulations, etc., the data has an inherently streaming nature. Furthermore, continuing advances will result in even higher data volumes, rendering storing all of the delivered data prior to processing increasingly impractical. Hence, in such e-science scenarios, processing and sharing of data streams will play a decisive role. It will enable new possibilities for researchers, since they will be able to subscribe to interesting data streams of other scientists without having to set up their own devices or experiments. This results in much better utilization of expensive equipment such as telescopes, satellites, etc. Further, processing and sharing data streams on-the-fly in the network helps to reduce network traffic and to avoid network congestion. Thus, even huge streams of data can be handled efficiently by removing unnecessary parts early on, e. g., by early filtering and aggregation, and by sharing previously generated data streams and processing results.|Richard Kuntschke,Bernhard Stegmaier,Alfons Kemper,Angelika Reiser","80493|VLDB|2005|Loadstar Load Shedding in Data Stream Mining|In this demo, we show that intelligent load shedding is essential in achieving optimum results in mining data streams under various resource constraints.

Loadstar uses a novel metric known as the quality of decision (QoD) to measure the level of uncertainty in classification. Resources are then allocated to sources where uncertainty is high. To make optimum classification decisions and accurate QoD measurement, Loadstar relies on feature prediction to model the data dropped by the load shedding mechanism. Furthermore, Loadstar is able to adapt to the changing data characteristics in data streams. The system thus offers a nice solution to data mining with resource constraints.|Yun Chi,Haixun Wang,Philip S.

As the number and size of such trees increases, so does the need for efficient data storage and query capabilities. Although much attention has been focused on XML as a tree data model, phylogenetic trees differ from document-oriented applications in their size and depth, and their need for structure-based queries rather than path-based queries.This paper focuses on Crimson, a tree storage system for phylogenetic trees used to evaluate phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms within the context of the NSF CIPRes project. A goal of the modeling component of the CIPRes project is to construct a huge simulation tree representing a \"gold standard\" of evolutionary history against which phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms can be tested.In this demonstration, we highlight our storage and indexing strategies and show how Crimson is used for benchmarking phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms.

In this scenario, a data owner (DO) constantly transmits its data to a service provider (SP), together with additional authentication information. Clients register continuous range queries to the SP. Whenever the data change, the SP must update the results of all affected queries and inform the clients accordingly. The clients can verify the correctness of the results using the authentication information provided by the DO. Compared to conventional databases, stream environments pose new challenges such as the need for fast structure updating, support for continuous query processing and authentication, and provision for temporal completeness. Specifically, in addition to the correctness of individual results, the client must be able to verify that there are no missing results in between updates. We face these challenges through several contributions. Since there is no previous work, we first present a technique, called REF, that achieves correctness and temporal completeness but incurs false transmissions, i.e., the SP has to inform clients whenever there is a data update, even if their results are not affected. Then, we propose CADS, which minimizes the processing and transmission overhead through an elaborate indexing scheme and a virtual caching mechanism. Finally, we extend CADS to the case where multiple owners outsource their data to the same SP. The SP integrates all data in a single authentication process, independently of the number of DOs.|Stavros Papadopoulos,Yin Yang,Dimitris Papadias","80674|VLDB|2006|Safety Guarantee of Continuous Join Queries over Punctuated Data Streams|Continuous join queries (CJQ) are needed for correlating data from multiple streams. One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) of the time series, the similarity search over directly indexed time series usually encounters a serious problem, known as the \"dimensionality curse\". Thus, many dimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing the dimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods, only Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries, which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initial studies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods, however, show that PLA performs no worse than others. Motivated by this, in this paper, we re-investigate PLA for approximating and indexing time series. Specifically, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced PLA-space, and prove that this function indeed results in a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original time series, which can lead to no false dismissals during the similarity search. As a second step, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds to improve the search efficiency. Our extensive experiments over a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data sets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of PLA together with the newly proposed lower bound distance, in terms of both pruning power and wall clock time, compared with two state-of-the-art reduction methods, Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA) and Chebyshev Polynomials (CP).|Qiuxia Chen,Lei Chen 0002,Xiang Lian,Yunhao Liu,Jeffrey Xu Yu","80711|VLDB|2006|NUITS A Novel User Interface for Efficient Keyword Search over Databases|The integration of database and information retrieval techniques provides users with a wide range of high quality services.

In such a setting the graph fragments that different peers have locally available or know about may arbitrarily overlap among peers, creating additional complexity for the PR computation.This paper presents the JXP algorithm for dynamically and collaboratively computing PR scores of Web pages that are arbitrarily distributed in a PP network. The algorithm runs at every peer, and it works by combining locally computed PR scores with random meetings among the peers in the network. It is scalable as the number of peers on the network grows, and experiments as well as theoretical arguments show that JXP scores converge to the true PR scores that one would obtain by a centralized computation.|Josiane Xavier Parreira,Debora Donato,Sebastian Michel,Gerhard Weikum","80741|VLDB|2007|Efficient Keyword Search over Virtual XML Views|Emerging applications such as personalized portals, enterprise search and web integration systems often require keyword search over semi-structured views.

An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

In addition, TopX can compute approximate top-k results using probabilistic score estimators, thus speeding up queries with a small and controllable loss in retrieval precision.|Martin Theobald,Ralf Schenkel,Gerhard Weikum","80708|VLDB|2006|Similarity Search A Matching Based Approach|Similarity search is a crucial task in multimedia retrieval and data mining. Most existing work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem, which considers the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set of features. Such an approach has two drawbacks ) it leaves many partial similarities uncovered ) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the k-n-match problem in this paper.The k-n-match problem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the data objects in n dimensions, where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and these n dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objects returned in the answer set match best. The k-n-match query is expected to be superior to the kNN query in discovering partial similarities, however, it may not be as good in identifying full similarity since a single value of n may only correspond to a particular aspect of an object instead of the entirety. To address this problem, we further introduce the frequent k-n-match problem, which finds a set of objects that appears in the k-n-match answers most frequently for a range of n values. Moreover, we propose search algorithms for both problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of individual attributes retrieved, which is especially useful for information retrieval from multiple systems. We can also apply the proposed algorithmic strategy to achieve a disk based algorithm for the (frequent) k-n-match query. By a thorough experimental study using both real and synthetic data sets, we show that ) the k-n-match query yields better result than the kNN query in identifying similar objects by partial similarities ) our proposed method (for processing the frequent k-n-match query) outperforms existing techniques for similarity search in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.|Anthony K.

For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states.

We propose two methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns, as well as fluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing only updates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the shared execution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections. We experimentally verify the applicability of the proposed techniques to continuous monitoring of large data and query sets.|Kyriakos Mouratidis,Man Lung Yiu,Dimitris Papadias,Nikos Mamoulis","80495|VLDB|2005|An Efficient and Scalable Approach to CNN Queries in a Road Network|A continuous search in a road network retrieves the objects which satisfy a query condition at any point on a path.

In this paper, we deal with NN queries as well as continuous NN queries in the context of moving objects databases. The performance of existing approaches based on the network distance such as the shortest path length depends largely on the density of objects of interest. To overcome this problem, we propose UNICONS (a uuniuque uconutinuous usuearch algorithm) for NN queries and CNN queries performed on a network. We incorporate the use of precomputed NN lists into Dijkstra's algorithm for NN queries. A mathematical rationale is employed to produce the final results of CNN queries. Experimental results for real-life datasets of various sizes show that UNICONS outperforms its competitors by up to . times for NN queries and  times for CNN queries depending on the density of objects and the number of NNs required.|Hyung-Ju Cho,Chin-Wan Chung","80639|VLDB|2006|Answering Top-k Queries Using Views|The problem of obtaining efficient answers to top-k queries has attracted a lot of research attention. Several algorithms and numerous variants of the top-k retrieval problem have been introduced in recent years. The general form of this problem requests the k highest ranked values from a relation, using monotone combining functions on (a subset of) its attributes.In this paper we explore space performance tradeoffs related to this problem. In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries. We then address the problem of identifying the most promising (in terms of performance) views to use for query answering in the presence of a collection of views. We formalize both problems and present efficient algorithms for their solution. We also discuss several extensions of the basic problems in this setting.We present the results of a thorough experimental study that deploys our techniques on real and synthetic data sets. Our results indicate that the techniques proposed herein comprise a robust solution to the problem of top-k query answering using views, gracefully exploring the space versus performance tradeoffs in the context of top-k query answering.|Gautam Das,Dimitrios Gunopulos,Nick Koudas,Dimitris Tsirogiannis","80718|VLDB|2006|Answering Top-k Queries with Multi-Dimensional Selections The Ranking Cube Approach|Observed in many real applications, a top-k query often consists of two components to reflect a user's preference a selection condition and a ranking function. A user may not only propose ad hoc ranking functions, but also use different interesting subsets of the data. In many cases, a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results. Previous work on top-k query processing mainly focuses on optimizing data access according to the ranking function only. The problem of efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections has not been well addressed yet.This paper proposes a new computational model, called ranking cube, for efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections. We define a rank-aware measure for the cube, capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional ranking analysis. Based on the ranking cube, an efficient query algorithm is developed which progressively retrieves data blocks until the top-k results are found. The curse of dimensionality is a well-known challenge for the data cube and we cope with this difficulty by introducing a new technique of ranking fragments.

Since the online Dijkstra's algorithm has been shown to be efficient only for short distances, we propose an efficient index, called distance signature, for distance computation and query processing over long distances. Distance signature discretizes the distances between objects and network nodes into categories and then encodes these categories. To minimize the storage and search costs, we present the optimal category partition, and the encoding and compression algorithms for the signatures, based on a simplified network topology. By mathematical analysis and experimental study, we showed that the signature index is efficient and robust for various data distributions, query workloads, parameter settings and network updates.|Haibo Hu,Dik Lun Lee,Victor C.

This problem has so far not been addressed in the literature and thus we describe an approach for the efficient construction of data-oriented, structured overlay networks from scratch in a self-organized way. Standard maintenance algorithms for overlay networks cannot accomplish this efficiently, as they are inherently sequential. Our proposed algorithm is completely decentralized, parallel, and can construct a new overlay network with short latency. At the same time it ensures good load-balancing for skewed data key distributions which result from preserving key order relationships as necessitated by data-oriented applications. We provide both a theoretical analysis of the basic algorithms and a complete system implementation that has been tested on PlanetLab.

In this paper, we design specialized algorithms that apply on indexed multi-dimensional data and fully exploit the characteristics of the problem.

The upcoming release of Microsoft's SQL Server supports XQuery as the query language over such XML data using its relational infrastructure.XQuery is an emerging WC recommendation for querying XML data. It provides a set of language constructs (FLWOR), the ability to dynamically shape the query result, and a large set of functions and operators. It includes the emerging WC recommendation XPath . for path-based navigational access. XQuery's type system is compatible with that of XML Schema and allows static type checking.This paper describes the experiences and the challenges in implementing XQuery in Microsoft's SQL Server .

This has led individual researchers to develop their own ad-hoc data generators for specific tasks. As a consequence, the resulting data distributions and query workloads are often hard to reproduce, analyze, and modify, thus preventing their wider usage.

Queries that uses these old values can produce invalid results. In order to manage the uncertainty between the actual sensor value and the database value, we propose a system called U-DBMS. U-DBMS extends the database system with uncertainty management functionalities. In particular, each data value is represented as an interval and a probability distribution function, and it can be processed with probabilistic query operators to produce imprecise (but correct) answers.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database.

Our method applies to records stored in databases in general and to distributed implementations of a Database As Service (DAS) in particular. Clients send records for insertion and search patterns already in encoded form and servers never operate on records in clear text.

LS continues to apply even if one attribute has high cardinality. Many skyline applications naturally have such data characteristics, and previous skyline methods have not exploited this property.

These solutions, however, assume that the imprecise facts can be interpreted independently of one another, a key assumption that is often violated in practice. Indeed, imprecise facts in real-world applications are often correlated, and such correlations can be captured as domain integrity constraints (e.g., repairs with the same customer names and models took place in the same city, or a text span can refer to a person or a city, but not both).

Current join algorithms either minimize the execution time at the expense of response time or minimize response time by producing results early without optimizing the total time. We present a hash-based join algorithm, called early hash join, which can be dynamically configured at any point during join processing to tradeoff faster production of results for overall execution time. We demonstrate that varying how inputs are read has a major effect on these two factors and provide formulas that allow an optimizer to calculate the expected rate of join output and the number of IO operations performed using different input reading strategies. Experimental results show that early hash join performs significantly fewer IO operations and executes faster than other early join algorithms, especially for one-to-many joins. Its overall execution time is comparable to standard hybrid hash join, but its response time is an order of magnitude faster. Thus, early hash join can replace hybrid hash join in any situation where a fast initial response time is beneficial without the penalty in overall execution time exhibited by other early join algorithms.|Ramon Lawrence","80668|VLDB|2006|Relaxing Join and Selection Queries|Database users can be frustrated by having an empty answer to a query.

Such authority analyses also apply to hot \"Web .\" applications that exhibit a natural graph structure, such as social networks (e.g., MySpace, Facebook) or tagging communities (e.g., Flickr, Del.icio.us). Finding the most trustworthy or most important authorities in such a community is a pressing need, given the huge scale and also the anonymity of social networks. Computing global authority measures in a Peer-to-Peer (PP) collaboration of autonomous peers is a hot research topic, in particular because of the incomplete local knowledge of the peers, which typically only know about (arbitrarily overlapping) sub-graphs of the complete graph. We demonstrate a self-organizing PP collaboration that, based on the local sub-graphs, efficiently computes global authority scores. In hand with the loosely-coupled spirit of a PP system, the computation is carried out in a completely asynchronous manner without any central knowledge or coordinating instance. We demonstrate the applicability of authority analyses to large-scale distributed systems.|Josiane Xavier Parreira,Sebastian Michel,Matthias Bender,Tom Crecelius,Gerhard Weikum","80787|VLDB|2007|Time Series Compressibility and Privacy|In this paper we study the trade-offs between time series compressibility and partial information hiding and their fundamental implications on how we should introduce uncertainty about individual values by perturbing them. More specifically, if the perturbation does not have the same compressibility properties as the original data, then it can be detected and filtered out, reducing uncertainty. Thus, by making the perturbation \"similar\" to the original data, we can both preserve the structure of the data better, while simultaneously making breaches harder. However, as data become more compressible, a fraction of the uncertainty can be removed if true values are leaked, revealing how they were perturbed. We formalize these notions, study the above trade-offs on real data and develop practical schemes which strike a good balance and can also be extended for on-the-fly data hiding in a streaming environment.|Spiros Papadimitriou,Feifei Li,George Kollios,Philip S.

As the number and size of such trees increases, so does the need for efficient data storage and query capabilities. Although much attention has been focused on XML as a tree data model, phylogenetic trees differ from document-oriented applications in their size and depth, and their need for structure-based queries rather than path-based queries.This paper focuses on Crimson, a tree storage system for phylogenetic trees used to evaluate phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms within the context of the NSF CIPRes project. A goal of the modeling component of the CIPRes project is to construct a huge simulation tree representing a \"gold standard\" of evolutionary history against which phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms can be tested.In this demonstration, we highlight our storage and indexing strategies and show how Crimson is used for benchmarking phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms.

Interestingly, until now no approach was proposed that is able to represent all of the above data in a single, powerful yet simple data model. This paper fills this gap.

Moreover, iDM is powerful enough to represent graph-structured data, intensional data as well as infinite data streams. Further, our model enables to represent the structural information available inside files. As a consequence, the artifical boundary between inside and outside a file is removed to enable a new class of queries. As iDM allows the representation of the whole personal dataspace  of a user in a single model, it is the foundation of the iMeMex Personal Dataspace Management System (PDSMS) , , .

In this paper, we study the problem of estimating selectivities of fuzzy string predicates. We develop a novel technique, called SEPIA, to solve the problem. It groups strings into clusters, builds a histogram structure for each cluster, and constructs a global histogram for the database. It is based on the following intuition given a query string q, a preselected string p in a cluster, and a string s in the cluster, based on the proximity between q and p, and the proximity between p and s, we can obtain a probability distribution from a global histogram about the similarity between q and s. We give a full specification of the technique using the edit distance function. We study challenges in adopting this technique, including how to construct the histogram structures, how to use them to do selectivity estimation, and how to alleviate the effect of non-uniform errors in the estimation.

Given a query and a view, the QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways (i) find an equivalent rewriting of the query using only the view, or (ii) find a maximal contained rewriting using only the view. The former is appropriate for classical query optimization and was recently studied by Xu and Ozsoyoglu for tree pattern queries (TP). However, for information integration, we cannot rely on equivalent rewriting and must instead use maximal contained rewriting as shown by Halevy. Motivated by this, we study maximal contained rewriting for TP, a core subset of XPath, both in the absence and presence of a schema. In the absence of a schema, we show there are queries whose maximal contained rewriting (MCR) can only be expressed as the union of exponentially many TPs. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting and give a polynomial time algorithm for testing the existence of an MCR. We also give an algorithm for generating the MCR when one exists. We then consider QAV in the presence of a schema. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting when the schema contains no recursion or union types, and show that it consists of at most one TP. We give an efficient polynomial time algorithm for generating the maximal contained rewriting whenever it exists. Finally, we discuss QAV in the presence of recursive schemas.|Laks V. S.

In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries. We then address the problem of identifying the most promising (in terms of performance) views to use for query answering in the presence of a collection of views. We formalize both problems and present efficient algorithms for their solution.

We provide the user with a virtual view that unifies the data, the domain knowledge and the knowledge inferable from the data using the domain knowledge. Because the virtual view is in the relational format, users can query the data and the knowledge in a seamlessly integrated manner. To facilitate knowledge representation and inferencing within the database engine, our approach leverages XML support in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server & IBM DB  PureXML). We provide a query rewriting mechanism to bridge the difference between logical and physical data modeling, so that queries on the virtual view can be automatically transformed to components that execute on the hybrid relational-XML engine in a way that is transparent to the user.|Lipyeow Lim,Haixun Wang,Min Wang","80550|VLDB|2005|CXHist  An On-line Classification-Based Histogram for XML String Selectivity Estimation|Query optimization in IBM's System RX, the first truly relational-XML hybrid data management system, requires accurate selectivity estimation of path-value pairs, i.e., the number of nodes in the XML tree reachable by a given path with the given text value. Previous techniques have been inadequate, because they have focused mainly on the tag-labeled paths (tree structure) of the XML data. For most real XML data, the number of distinct string values at the leaf nodes is orders of magnitude larger than the set of distinct rooted tag paths. Hence, the real challenge lies in accurate selectivity estimation of the string predicates on the leaf values reachable via a given path.In this paper, we present CXHist, a novel workload-aware histogram technique that provides accurate selectivity estimation on a broad class of XML string-based queries. CXHist builds a histogram in an on-line manner by grouping queries into buckets using their true selectivity obtained from query feedback. The set of queries associated with each bucket is summarized into feature distributions. These feature distributions mimic a Bayesian classifier that is used to route a query to its associated bucket during selectivity estimation. We show how CXHist can be used for two general types of path, string queries exact match queries and substring match queries. Experiments using a prototype show that CXHist provides accurate selectivity estimation for both exact match queries and substring match queries.|Lipyeow Lim,Min Wang,Jeffrey Scott Vitter","80769|VLDB|2007|Structured Materialized Views for XML Queries|The performance of XML database queries can be greatly enhanced by rewriting them using materialized views.

Today, database systems typically maintain views eagerly in the same transaction as the base table updates. This has the effect that updates pay for view maintenance while beneficiaries (queries) get a free ride View maintenance overhead can be significant and it seems unfair to have updates bear the cost. We present a novel way to lazily maintain materialized views that relieves updates of this overhead. Maintenance of a view is postponed until the system has free cycles or the view is referenced by a query. View maintenance is fully or partly hidden from queries depending on the system load. Ideally, views are maintained entirely on system time at no cost to updates and queries. The efficiency of lazy maintenance is improved by combining updates from several transactions into a single maintenance operation, by condensing multiple updates of the same row into a single update, and by exploiting row versioning. Experiments using a prototype implementation in Microsoft SQL Server show much faster response times for updates and also significant reduction in maintenance cost when combining updates.|Jingren Zhou,Per-√\u2026ke Larson,Hicham G.

However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) of the time series, the similarity search over directly indexed time series usually encounters a serious problem, known as the \"dimensionality curse\". Thus, many dimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing the dimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods, only Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries, which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initial studies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods, however, show that PLA performs no worse than others. Motivated by this, in this paper, we re-investigate PLA for approximating and indexing time series. Specifically, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced PLA-space, and prove that this function indeed results in a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original time series, which can lead to no false dismissals during the similarity search. As a second step, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds to improve the search efficiency. Our extensive experiments over a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data sets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of PLA together with the newly proposed lower bound distance, in terms of both pruning power and wall clock time, compared with two state-of-the-art reduction methods, Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA) and Chebyshev Polynomials (CP).|Qiuxia Chen,Lei Chen 0002,Xiang Lian,Yunhao Liu,Jeffrey Xu Yu","80678|VLDB|2006|Trustworthy Keyword Search for Regulatory-Compliant Record Retention|Recent litigation and intense regulatory focus on secure retention of electronic records have spurred a rush to introduce Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) storage devices for retaining business records such as electronic mail.

Specifically, some form of index is needed for timely access to the records, but unless the index is maintained securely, the records can in effect be hidden or altered, even if stored in WORM storage. In this paper, we systematically analyze the requirements for establishing a trustworthy inverted index to enable keyword-based search queries. We propose a novel scheme for effcient creation of such an index and demonstrate, through extensive simulations and experiments with an enterprise keyword search engine, that the scheme can achieve online update speeds while maintaining good query performance.

Recently, locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its variations have been proposed as indexing techniques for approximate similarity search. A significant drawback of these approaches is the requirement for a large number of hash tables in order to achieve good search quality. This paper proposes a new indexing scheme called multi-probe LSH that overcomes this drawback. Multi-probe LSH is built on the well-known LSH technique, but it intelligently probes multiple buckets that are likely to contain query results in a hash table. Our method is inspired by and improves upon recent theoretical work on entropy-based LSH designed to reduce the space requirement of the basic LSH method. We have implemented the multi-probe LSH method and evaluated the implementation with two different high-dimensional datasets. Our evaluation shows that the multi-probe LSH method substantially improves upon previously proposed methods in both space and time efficiency. To achieve the same search quality, multi-probe LSH has a similar time-efficiency as the basic LSH method while reducing the number of hash tables by an order of magnitude. In comparison with the entropy-based LSH method, to achieve the same search quality, multi-probe LSH uses less query time and  to  times fewer number of hash tables.|Qin Lv,William Josephson,Zhe Wang,Moses Charikar,Kai Li","80741|VLDB|2007|Efficient Keyword Search over Virtual XML Views|Emerging applications such as personalized portals, enterprise search and web integration systems often require keyword search over semi-structured views.

An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

TopX addresses these issues by precomputing score and path information in an appropriately designed index structure, by largely avoiding or postponing the evaluation of expensive path conditions so as to preserve the sequential access pattern on index lists, and by selectively scheduling random accesses when they are cost-beneficial. In addition, TopX can compute approximate top-k results using probabilistic score estimators, thus speeding up queries with a small and controllable loss in retrieval precision.|Martin Theobald,Ralf Schenkel,Gerhard Weikum","80708|VLDB|2006|Similarity Search A Matching Based Approach|Similarity search is a crucial task in multimedia retrieval and data mining. Most existing work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem, which considers the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set of features. Such an approach has two drawbacks ) it leaves many partial similarities uncovered ) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the k-n-match problem in this paper.The k-n-match problem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the data objects in n dimensions, where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and these n dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objects returned in the answer set match best. The k-n-match query is expected to be superior to the kNN query in discovering partial similarities, however, it may not be as good in identifying full similarity since a single value of n may only correspond to a particular aspect of an object instead of the entirety. To address this problem, we further introduce the frequent k-n-match problem, which finds a set of objects that appears in the k-n-match answers most frequently for a range of n values. Moreover, we propose search algorithms for both problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of individual attributes retrieved, which is especially useful for information retrieval from multiple systems. We can also apply the proposed algorithmic strategy to achieve a disk based algorithm for the (frequent) k-n-match query. By a thorough experimental study using both real and synthetic data sets, we show that ) the k-n-match query yields better result than the kNN query in identifying similar objects by partial similarities ) our proposed method (for processing the frequent k-n-match query) outperforms existing techniques for similarity search in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.|Anthony K.

In this paper, we propose a family of stack-based algorithms to handle path, twig, and dag pattern queries for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in particular. Our algorithms do not precompute the transitive closure nor path indexes for a given graph, however they achieve an optimal runtime complexity quadratic in the average size of the query variable bindings.

Due to the wide adoption of graph models, fast containment search of graph data finds many applications in various domains. In comparison to traditional graph search that retrieves all the graphs containing q (q &sube g), containment search has its own indexing characteristics that have not yet been examined. In this paper, we perform a systematic study on these characteristics and propose a contrast subgraph-based indexing model, called cIndex. Contrast subgraphs capture the structure differences between model graphs and query graphs, and are thus perfect for indexing due to their high selectivity. Using a redundancy-aware feature selection process, cIndex can sort out a set of significant and distinctive contrast subgraphs and maximize its indexing capability. We show that it is NP-complete to choose the best set of indexing features, and our greedy algorithm can approximate the one-level optimal index within a ratio of -- e. Taking this solution as a base indexing model, we further extend it to accommodate hierarchical indexing methodologies and apply data space clustering and sampling techniques to reduce the index construction time. The proposed methodology provides a general solution to containment search and indexing, not only for graphs, but also for any data with transitive relations as well. Experimental results on real test data show that cIndex achieves near-optimal pruning power on various containment search workloads, and confirms its obvious advantage over indices built for traditional graph search in this new scenario.|Chen Chen,Xifeng Yan,Philip S.

In this paper we examine aggregation in a multi-core environment, the Sun UltraSPARC T, a chip multiprocessor with eight cores and a shared L cache. Aggregation is an important aspect of query processing that is seemingly easy to understand and implement. Our research, however, demonstrates that a chip multiprocessor adds new dimensions to understanding hash-based aggregation performance---concurrent sharing of aggregation data structures and contentious accesses to frequently used values. We also identify a trade off between private data structures assigned to each thread versus shared data structures for aggregation. Depending on input characteristics, different aggregation strategies are optimal and choosing the wrong strategy can result in a performance penalty of over an order of magnitude. We provide a thorough explanation of the factors affecting aggregation performance on chip multiprocessors and identify three key input characteristics that dictate performance () average run length of identical group-by values, () locality of references to the aggregation hash table, and () frequency of repeated accesses to the same hash table location. We then introduce an adaptive aggregation operator that performs lightweight sampling of the input to choose the correct aggregation strategy with high accuracy. Our experiments verify that our adaptive algorithm chooses the highest performing aggregation strategy on a number of common input distributions.|John Cieslewicz,Kenneth A.

A significant percentage of these scans are executed as index based scans of the data. This is especially true when the data is physically clustered on the index columns using the various clustering schemes employed by database engines. Common database management systems have only limited ability to reuse buffer content across multiple running queries due to their treatment of queries in isolation. Previous attempts to coordinate scans for better buffer reuse were limited to table scans only. Attempts for index based scan sharing were non existent or were less than satisfactory due to drifting between scans. In this paper, we describe a mechanism to keep scans using the same index closer together on scan position during scanning. This is achieved via intelligent placement of index scans at scan start time based on their scan ranges and speeds. This is then augmented by adaptive throttling of scan speeds based on the index scans runtime behavior during scan execution. We discuss the challenges in doing it for index scans in comparison to the more common table scan sharing. We show that this can be done with minimal changes to an existing database management system as demonstrated in our DB UDB prototype. Our experiments show significant gains in end-to-end response times and disk IO for TPC-H workloads.|Christian A.

As a result, it is of special interest to process graph containment queries effectively on large graph databases. Given a graph database G, and a query raph q, the graph containment query is to retrieve all graphs in G which contain q as subgraph(s). Due to the vast number of graphs in G and the nature of complexity for subgraph isomorphism testing, it is desirable to make use of high-quality graph indexing mechanisms to reduce the overall query processing cost. In this paper, we propose a new cost-effective graph indexing method based on frequent tree-features of the graph database. We analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of tree as indexing feature from three critical aspects feature size, feature selection cost, and pruning power. In order to achieve better pruning ability than existing graph-based indexing methods, we select, in addition to frequent tree-features (Tree), a small number of discriminative graphs (&Delta) on demand, without a costly graph mining process beforehand. Our study verifies that (Tree+&Delta) is a better choice than graph for indexing purpose, denoted (Tree+&Delta &geGraph), to address the graph containment query problem. It has two implications () the index construction by (Tree+&Delta) is efficient, and () the graph containment query processing by (Tree+&Delta) is efficient. Our experimental studies demonstrate that (Tree+&Delta) has a compact index structure, achieves an order of magnitude better performance in index construction, and most importantly, outperforms up-to-date graph-based indexing methods gIndex and C-Tree, in graph containment query processing.|Peixiang Zhao,Jeffrey Xu Yu,Philip S.

However, they are not able to handle large graphs, andor they do not allow interaction. We are interested on large graphs, with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Such graphs bring two challenges the first one is that any straightforward interactive manipulation will be prohibitively slow. The second one is sensory overload even if we could plot and replot the graph quickly, the user would be overwhelmed with the vast volume of information because the screen would be too cluttered as nodes and edges overlap each other.Our GMine system addresses both these issues, by using summarization and multi-resolution. GMine offers multi-resolution graph exploration by partitioning a given graph into a hierarchy of communities-within-communities and storing it into a novel R-treelike structure which we name G-Tree.

Text is associated with nodes and possibly edges. Keyword search on such graphs has received much attention lately. A central problem in this scenario is to efficiently extract from the data graph a small number of the \"best\" answer trees. A Backward Expanding search, starting at nodes matching keywords and working up toward confluent roots, is commonly used for predominantly text-driven queries. But it can perform poorly if some keywords match many nodes, or some node has very large degree.In this paper we propose a new search algorithm, Bidirectional Search, which improves on Backward Expanding search by allowing forward search from potential roots towards leaves. To exploit this flexibility, we devise a novel search frontier prioritization technique based on spreading activation. We present a performance study on real data, establishing that Bidirectional Search significantly outperforms Backward Expanding search.|Varun Kacholia,Shashank Pandit,Soumen Chakrabarti,S.

For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states. We also show its superior performance over the centralized schemes in terms of update, query, and total communication costs.|Arnab Bhattacharya,Anand Meka,Ambuj K.

In spite of the tree structure causing distinctions to be made between nodes at different levels in the tree, we show that the load at each node is approximately equal. In spite of the tree structure providing precisely one path between any pair of nodes, we show that sideways routing tables maintained at each node provide sufficient fault tolerance to permit efficient repair. Specifically, in a network with N nodes, we guarantee that both exact queries and range queries can be answered in O(log N) steps and also that update operations (to both data and network) have an amortized cost of O(log N).

All existing methods, however, assume the Euclidean distance metric. In this paper we study k-NN monitoring in road networks, where the distance between a query and a data object is determined by the length of the shortest path connecting them. We propose two methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns, as well as fluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing only updates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the shared execution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections. We experimentally verify the applicability of the proposed techniques to continuous monitoring of large data and query sets.|Kyriakos Mouratidis,Man Lung Yiu,Dimitris Papadias,Nikos Mamoulis","80596|VLDB|2005|AReNA Adaptive Distributed Catalog Infrastructure Based On Relevance Networks|Wide area applications (WAAs) utilize a WAN infrastructure (e.g., the Internet) to connect a federation of hundreds of servers with tens of thousands of clients.

However, there is a lack of systematic study on the computation of network distances, which is the most fundamental difference between a road network and a Euclidean space. Since the online Dijkstra's algorithm has been shown to be efficient only for short distances, we propose an efficient index, called distance signature, for distance computation and query processing over long distances. Distance signature discretizes the distances between objects and network nodes into categories and then encodes these categories. To minimize the storage and search costs, we present the optimal category partition, and the encoding and compression algorithms for the signatures, based on a simplified network topology. By mathematical analysis and experimental study, we showed that the signature index is efficient and robust for various data distributions, query workloads, parameter settings and network updates.|Haibo Hu,Dik Lun Lee,Victor C.

This problem has so far not been addressed in the literature and thus we describe an approach for the efficient construction of data-oriented, structured overlay networks from scratch in a self-organized way. Standard maintenance algorithms for overlay networks cannot accomplish this efficiently, as they are inherently sequential. Our proposed algorithm is completely decentralized, parallel, and can construct a new overlay network with short latency. At the same time it ensures good load-balancing for skewed data key distributions which result from preserving key order relationships as necessitated by data-oriented applications. We provide both a theoretical analysis of the basic algorithms and a complete system implementation that has been tested on PlanetLab.

In this system, necessary changes are pushed from sources to repositories and from repositories to clients so that they are automatically informed about the changes of interest. Clients and repositories associate coherence requirements with a data item d, denoting the maximum permissible deviation of the value of d known to them from the value at the source. Given a list of data item, coherence served by each repository and a set of client, data item, coherence requests, we address the following problem How do we assign clients to the repositories, so that the fidelity, that is, the degree to which client coherence requirements are met, is maximizedIn this paper, we first prove that the client assignment problem is NP-Hard. Given the closeness of the client-repository assignment problem and the matching problem in combinatorial optimization, we have tailored and studied two available solutions to the matching problem from the literature (i) max-flow min-cost and (ii) stable-marriages. Our empirical results using real-world dynamic data show that the presence of coherence requirements adds a new dimension to the client-repository assignment problem. An interesting result is that in update intensive situations a better fidelity can be delivered to the clients by attempting to deliver data to some of the clients at a coherence lower than what they desire. A consequence of this observation is the necessity for quick adaptation of the delivered (vs. desired) data coherence with respect to the changes in the dynamics of the system. We develop techniques for such adaptation and show their impressive performance.|Shetal Shah,Krithi Ramamritham,Chinya V.
