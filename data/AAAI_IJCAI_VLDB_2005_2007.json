However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction. Simple examples are given in order to show the advantages of the algorithm.|Marc G.

Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","16190|IJCAI|2005|An MCMC Approach to Solving Hybrid Factored MDPs|Hybrid approximate linear programming (HALP) has recently emerged as a promising framework for solving large factored Markov decision processes (MDPs) with discrete and continuous state and action variables. Our work addresses its major computational bottleneck - constraint satisfaction in large structured domains of discrete and continuous variables. We analyze this problem and propose a novelMarkov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC) method for finding the most violated constraint of a relaxed HALP. This method does not require the discretization of continuous variables, searches the space of constraints intelligently based on the structure of factored MDPs, and its space complexity is linear in the number of variables. We test the method on a set of large control problems and demonstrate improvements over alternative approaches.|Branislav Kveton,Milos Hauskrecht","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world. The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16267|IJCAI|2005|Conditional Planning in the Discrete Belief Space|Probabilistic planning with observability restrictions, as formalized for example as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), has a wide range of applications, but it is computationally extremely difficult.

We consider a computationally easier form of planning that ignores exact probabilities, and give an algorithm for a class of planning problems with partial observability. We show that the basic backup step in the algorithm is NP-complete. Then we proceed to give an algorithm for the backup step, and demonstrate how it can be used as a basis of an efficient algorithm for constructing plans.|Jussi Rintanen","66064|AAAI|2007|Optimizing Anthrax Outbreak Detection Using Reinforcement Learning|The potentially catastrophic impact of a bioterrorist attack makes developing effective detection methods essential for public health. In the case of anthrax attack, a delay of hours in making a right decision can lead to hundreds of lives lost. Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision. We present empirical evidence illustrating that the performance of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and timeliness is improved significantly by utilizing POMDPs.|Masoumeh T.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs. Our empirical results show that our modified IP on mPSRs outperforms, in most cases, IP on both PSRs and POMDPs.|Michael R. James,Satinder P.

One approach that effectively addresses the intractable memory requirements of POMDP algorithms is based on representing POMDP policies as finite-state controllers. In this paper, we illustrate some fundamental disadvantages of existing techniques that use controllers. We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques. The results open up promising research directions for solving large POMDPs using nonlinear programming methods.|Christopher Amato,Daniel S.

We identify two types of structures in the belief space and exploit them to reduce significantly the number of constraints in the linear programs used for pruning. The benefits of the new technique are evaluated both analytically and experimentally, showing that it can lead to significant performance improvement.

We focus, primarily, on the execution of phase-dependent policies. Phases are introduced into a model to represent relevant execution history, but there is no physical manifestation of phases in the real world. We treat phases as partially observable state features and show how a belief distribution over phase configurations can be derived from observable state features through the use of transient analysis for Markov chains. This results in an efficient method for phase tracking during execution that can be combined with the QMDP value method for POMDPs to make action choices. We also discuss, briefly, how the structure of MDPs with phase transitions can be exploited in structured value iteration with symbolic representation of vectors and matrices.|H√•kan L. S.

Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables.\" We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than  million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.|Daniel J.

An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the documents alone. Experimental results confirm improved performance, breaking through the plateau previously reached in the field.|Evgeniy Gabrilovich,Shaul Markovitch","16726|IJCAI|2007|Combining Learning and Word Sense Disambiguation for Intelligent User Profiling|Understanding user interests from text documents can provide support to personalized information recommendation services. Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16413|IJCAI|2007|Word Sense Disambiguation through Sememe Labeling|Currently most word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems are relatively individual word sense experts. Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

Given the pattern V -NP-P-NP in the text, where V is verb, NP is a noun phrase, P is the preposition and NP is the other noun phrase, the question asked is where does P - NP attach V or NP This question is typically answered using both the word and the world knowledge. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution. Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach. The unambiguous V - P - N and N - P -N tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N - P - N tuples of the test corpus. A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation (WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of Vs and Ns in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP, NP - P - NP. For experimentation, Brown Corpus provides the training data andWall Street Journal Corpus the test data. The accuracy obtained for PP-attachment resolution is close to %.

They formulate a search problem as the problem of model expansion (MX), which is the problem of expanding a given structure with new relations so that it satisfies a given formula. Their long-term goal is to produce practical tools to solve combinatorial search problems, especially those in NP. In this framework, a problem is encoded in a logic, an instance of the problem is represented by a finite structure, and a solver generates solutions to the problem. This approach relies on propositionalisation of high-level specifications, and on the efficiency of modern SAT solvers. Here, we propose an efficient algorithm which combines grounding with partial evaluation. Since the MX framework is based on classical logic, we are able to take advantage of known results for the so-called guarded fragments. In the case of k-guarded formulas with inductive definitions under a natural restriction, the algorithm performs much better than naive grounding by relying on connections between k-guarded formulas and tree decompositions.|Murray Patterson,Yongmei Liu,Eugenia Ternovska,Arvind Gupta","16447|IJCAI|2007|Learning to Walk through Imitation|Programming a humanoid robot to walk is a challenging problem in robotics. Traditional approaches rely heavily on prior knowledge of the robot's physical parameters to devise sophisticated control algorithms for generating a stable gait. In this paper, we provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that a humanoid robot can learn to walk directly by imitating a human gait obtained from motion capture (mocap) data. Training using human motion capture is an intuitive and flexible approach to programming a robot but direct usage of mocap data usually results in dynamically unstable motion. Furthermore, optimization using mocap data in the humanoid full-body joint-space is typically intractable. We propose a new modelfree approach to tractable imitation-based learning in humanoids. We represent kinematic information from human motion capture in a low dimensional subspace and map motor commands in this lowdimensional space to sensory feedback to learn a predictive dynamic model. This model is used within an optimization framework to estimate optimal motor commands that satisfy the initial kinematic constraints as best as possible while at the same time generating dynamically stable motion. We demonstrate the viability of our approach by providing examples of dynamically stable walking learned from mocap data using both a simulator and a real humanoid robot.|Rawichote Chalodhorn,David B.

The first one, explainable equivalence, requires that two abductive programs have the same explainability for any observation. Another one, explanatory equivalence, guarantees that any observation has exactly the same explanations in each abductive framework. Explanatory equivalence is a stronger notion than explainable equivalence. In first-order abduction, explainable equivalence can be verified by the notion of extensional equivalence in default theories. In nonmonotonic logic programs, explanatory equivalence can be checked by means of the notion of relative strong equivalence.

This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","66222|AAAI|2007|Scaling Up Solving POMDPs through Value Based Clustering|Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide an appropriately rich model for agents operating under partial knowledge of the environment.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16267|IJCAI|2005|Conditional Planning in the Discrete Belief Space|Probabilistic planning with observability restrictions, as formalized for example as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), has a wide range of applications, but it is computationally extremely difficult.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs.

Second, queries to the system may be posed with keywords rather than in a structured form. Third, the data from the sources may be extracted using information extraction techniques and so may yield imprecise data. As a first step to building such a system, we introduce the concept of probabilistic schema mappings and analyze their formal foundations.

Recently, with the increasing use of ontology in various applications, the quest has become more concrete and urgent. However, manipulating knowledge along with relational data in DBMSs is not a trivial undertaking. In this paper, we introduce a novel, unified framework for managing data and domain knowledge. We provide the user with a virtual view that unifies the data, the domain knowledge and the knowledge inferable from the data using the domain knowledge. Because the virtual view is in the relational format, users can query the data and the knowledge in a seamlessly integrated manner. To facilitate knowledge representation and inferencing within the database engine, our approach leverages XML support in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server & IBM DB  PureXML). We provide a query rewriting mechanism to bridge the difference between logical and physical data modeling, so that queries on the virtual view can be automatically transformed to components that execute on the hybrid relational-XML engine in a way that is transparent to the user.|Lipyeow Lim,Haixun Wang,Min Wang","80860|VLDB|2007|Anytime Measures for Top-k Algorithms|Top-k queries on large multi-attribute data sets are fundamental operations in information retrieval and ranking applications.

We adopt a probabilistic approach where we seek to report at any point of operation of the algorithm the confidence that the top-k result has been identified. Such a functionality can be a valuable asset when one is interested in reducing the runtime cost of top-k computations.

In this paper, we apply the idea of typicality analysis from psychology and cognition science to database query answering, and study the novel problem of answering top-k typicality queries. We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical NBA players\", the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players\", the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is often too costly for online query answering on large databases. We develop a series of approximation methods for various situations. () The randomized tournament algorithm has linear complexity though it does not provide a theoretical guarantee on the quality of the answers. () The direct local typicality approximation using VP-trees provides an approximation quality guarantee. () A VP-tree can be exploited to index a large set of objects. Then, typicality queries can be answered efficiently with quality guarantees by a tournament method based on a Local Typicality Tree data structure. An extensive performance study using two real data sets and a series of synthetic data sets clearly show that top-k typicality queries are meaningful and our methods are practical.|Ming Hua,Jian Pei,Ada Wai-Chee Fu,Xuemin Lin,Ho-fung Leung","16660|IJCAI|2007|Selective Supervision Guiding Supervised Learning with Decision-Theoretic Active Learning|An inescapable bottleneck with learning from large data sets is the high cost of labeling training data.

We look at methods that guide the allocation of human effort for labeling data so as to get the greatest boosts in discriminatory power with increasing amounts of work.

Beyond the scaling difficulties that arise with lookups in large data sets, the complexity in these domains is exacerbated by an imprecise definition of similarity. In this paper, we describe a method to learn a similarity function from only weakly labeled positive examples. Once learned, this similarity function is used as the basis of a hash function to severely constrain the number of points considered for each lookup. Tested on a large real-world audio dataset, only a tiny fraction of the points (.%) are ever considered for each lookup. To increase efficiency, no comparisons in the original high-dimensional space of points are required. The performance far surpasses, in terms of both efficiency and accuracy, a state-of-the-art Locality-Sensitive-Hashing based technique for the same problem and data set.|Shumeet Baluja,Michele Covell","80816|VLDB|2007|Probabilistic Skylines on Uncertain Data|Uncertain data are inherent in some important applications. Although a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data and answering some types of queries on uncertain data, how to conduct advanced analysis on uncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper, we tackle the problem of skyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all the objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p. Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop two efficient algorithms. The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.|Jian Pei,Bin Jiang,Xuemin Lin,Yidong Yuan","65596|AAAI|2005|A Graph Theoretical Foundation for Integrating RDF Ontologies|RDF ontologies are rapidly increasing in number.

A number of methods have recently been proposed for privacy preserving data mining of multidimensional data records. One of the methods for privacy preserving data mining is that of anonymization, in which a record is released only if it is indistinguishable from k other entities in the data. We note that methods such as k-anonymity are highly dependent upon spatial locality in order to effectively implement the technique in a statistically robust way. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and the concept of spatial locality is no longer easy to define from an application point of view. In this paper, we view the k-anonymization problem from the perspective of inference attacks over all possible combinations of attributes. We show that when the data contains a large number of attributes which may be considered quasi-identifiers, it becomes difficult to anonymize the data without an unacceptably high amount of information loss. This is because an exponential number of combinations of dimensions can be used to make precise inference attacks, even when individual attributes are partially specified within a range. We provide an analysis of the effect of dimensionality on k-anonymity methods. We conclude that when a data set contains a large number of attributes which are open to inference attacks, we are faced with a choice of either completely suppressing most of the data or losing the desired level of anonymity. Thus, this paper shows that the curse of high dimensionality also applies to the problem of privacy preserving data mining.|Charu C.

Data management continues to grow, more than doubling in data and transaction volumes every two years with a growth in deployments to fuel a $ billion market. A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications.

Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities. Missing this opportunity will be worse than missing the Internet.

The vast majority of this work has assumed that negotiation issues are independent, so agents can aggregate the utilities of the issue values by simple summation, producing linear utility functions. In the real world, however, such aggregations are often unrealistic. We cannot, for example, just add up the value of car's carburetor and the value of car's engine when engineers negotiate over the design a car. These value of these choices are interdependent, resulting in nonlinear utility functions. In this paper, we address this important gap in current negotiation techniques. We propose a negotiation protocol where agents employ adjusted sampling to generate proposals, and a bidding-based mechanism is used to find social-welfare maximizing deals. Our experimental results show that our method substantially outperforms existing methods in large non-linear utility spaces like those found in real world contexts.|Takayuki Ito,Hiromitsu Hattori,Mark Klein","16608|IJCAI|2007|Gossip-Based Aggregation of Trust in Decentralized Reputation Systems|Decentralized Reputation Systems have recently emerged as a prominent method of establishing trust among self-interested agents in online environments.

Whereas social laws need to be enforced in a top-down manner, norms evolve in a bottom-up manner and are typically more self-enforcing. While effective norms can significantly enhance performance of individual agents and agent societies, there has been little work in multiagent systems on the formation of social norms. We propose a model that supports the emergence of social norms via learning from interaction experiences. In our model, individual agents repeatedly interact with other agents in the society over instances of a given scenario. Each interaction is framed as a stage game. An agent learns its policy to play the game over repeated interactions with multiple agents. We term this mode of learning social learning, which is distinct from an agent learning from repeated interactions against the same player. We are particularly interested in situations where multiple action combinations yield the same optimal payoff. The key research question is to find out if the entire population learns to converge to a consistent norm. In addition to studying such emergence of social norms among homogeneous learners via social learning, we study the effects of heterogeneous learners, population size, multiple social groups, etc.|Sandip Sen,St√©phane Airiau","16039|IJCAI|2005|Achieving Allocatively-Efficient and Strongly Budget-Balanced Mechanisms in the Network Flow Domain for Bounded-Rational Agents|Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms are a framework for finding a solution to a distributed optimization problem in systems of self-interested agents.

This is done by choosing a mechanism that is not strategy-proof but rather strategy-resistant.

In this work, we study the automated design of mechanisms that only require partial revelation of utilities. Each agent's type space is partitioned into a finite set of partial types, and agents (should) report the partial type within which their full type lies. We provide a set of optimization routines that can be combined to address the trade-offs between the amount of communication, approximation of incentive properties, and objective value achieved by a mechanism. This allows for the automated design of partial revelation mechanisms with worst-case guarantees on incentive properties for any objective function (revenue, social welfare, etc.).|Nathanael Hyafil,Craig Boutilier","65611|AAAI|2005|Coalitional Games in Open Anonymous Environments|Coalition formation is a key aspect of automated negotiation among self-interested agents.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking.

Given the pattern V -NP-P-NP in the text, where V is verb, NP is a noun phrase, P is the preposition and NP is the other noun phrase, the question asked is where does P - NP attach V or NP This question is typically answered using both the word and the world knowledge. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution. Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach. The unambiguous V - P - N and N - P -N tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N - P - N tuples of the test corpus. A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation (WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of Vs and Ns in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP, NP - P - NP. For experimentation, Brown Corpus provides the training data andWall Street Journal Corpus the test data. The accuracy obtained for PP-attachment resolution is close to %.

Machine learning (ML) provides several techniques for automatically acquiring those heuristics. Usually, a planner solves a problem, and a ML technique generates knowledge from the search episode in terms of complete plans (macro-operators or cases), or heuristics (also named control knowledge in planning). In this paper, we present a novel way of generating planning heuristics we learn heuristics in one planner and transfer them to another planner. This approach is based on the fact that different planners employ different search bias. We want to extract knowledge from the search performed by one planner and use the learned knowledge on another planner that uses a different search bias. The goal is to improve the efficiency of the second planner by capturing regularities of the domain that it would not capture by itself due to its bias. We employ a deductive learning method (EBL) that is able to automatically acquire control knowledge by generating bounded explanations of the problem-solving episodes in a Graphplan-based planner. Then, we transform the learned knowledge so that it can be used by a bidirectional planner.|Susana Fern√°ndez,Ricardo Aler,Daniel Borrajo","66231|AAAI|2007|Learning by Combining Observations and User Edits|We introduce a new collaborative machine learning paradigm in which the user directs a learning algorithm by manually editing the automatically induced model.

We draw on a recent framework for \"structured output classification\" (e.g. syntactic parsing) known as learning as search optimization (LaSO). The LaSO approach uses discriminative learning to optimize heuristic functions for search-based computation of structured outputs and has shown promising results in a number of domains. However, the search problems that arise in AI planning tend to be qualitatively very different from those considered in structured classification, which raises a number of potential difficulties in directly applying LaSO to planning. In this paper, we discuss these issues and describe a LaSO-based approach for discriminative learning of beam-search heuristics in AI planning domains. We give convergence results for this approach and present experiments in several benchmark domains. The results show that the discriminatively trained heuristic can outperform the one used by the planner FF and another recent non-discriminative learning approach.|Yuehua Xu,Alan Fern,Sung Wook Yoon"]]},"title":{"entropy":6.371315355103859,"topics":["the web, the, sense disambiguation, word disambiguation, word sense, learning for, reinforcement learning, learning, learning and, for the, situation calculus, large scale, system for, neural networks, support vector, web service, machine learning, semantic web, the semantic, information extraction","for and, description logic, and, constraint satisfaction, for logic, mechanism design, reasoning about, logic programs, natural language, the problems, constraint problems, logic, for planning, and reasoning, arc consistency, for reasoning, constraint and, for problems, for constraint, representations and","model for, bayesian networks, model, local search, search for, heuristic search, mobile robot, markov processes, decision processes, transfer learning, search, markov decision, named entity, for classification, web search, model and, using, for robot, and evaluation, graphical model","algorithm for, for data, distributed optimization, system for, framework for, efficient for, learning games, combinatorial auctions, constraint optimization, for, distributed pomdps, for optimization, value iteration, distributed constraint, for xml, data streams, efficient and, method for, distributed, efficient","sense disambiguation, word disambiguation, word sense, with, learning with, common sense, data using, schema mapping, and data, for disambiguation, word with, for data, for sense, estimation and, with and, data, for with, semi-supervised with, data with, unsupervised","the, for the, the and, vector machine, situation calculus, support vector, the impact, support machine, support for, the case, data sets, the study, case study, the data, probability the, the support, support, sets, user, neural","and reasoning, representations and, for reasoning, reasoning about, natural language, language and, for knowledge, knowledge and, between and, language for, representations for, action description, predictive representations, reasoning, integrating and, the reasoning, and its, planning goal, with action, knowledge","for and, and, model-based diagnosis, temporal and, combining and, theory and, temporal for, generation for, and algorithm, approach for, and approach, and system, novel approach, for diagnosis, approach, for propositional, temporal, and event, and diagnosis, and structure","for classification, probabilistic model, inference for, gaussian process, probabilistic for, using probabilistic, and inference, classification and, trust model, dynamic for, hierarchical model, using classification, probabilistic and, exploiting learning, architecture for, model classification, and dynamic, inference model, process model, probabilistic","model for, transfer learning, model, markov processes, decision processes, model and, markov decision, using for, using, reinforcement learning, learning model, graphical model, decision for, using model, using and, hidden markov, for markov, image using, and recognition, for recognition","algorithm for, framework for, system for, and algorithm, approach for, for based, monitoring system, for statistical, new for, online for, fast algorithm, for space, for and, learning algorithm, for networks, for selection, fast for, based approach, new algorithm, genetic for","for optimization, distributed optimization, for data, combinatorial auctions, value for, constraint optimization, for distributed, distributed pomdps, value iteration, distributed constraint, distributed and, and data, analysis for, value functions, solving pomdps, and auctions, and optimization, networked pomdps, distributed, and pomdps"],"ranking":[["65537|AAAI|2005|Word Sense Disambiguation with Semi-Supervised Learning|Current word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning are still limited in that they do not work well for all words in a language.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","66166|AAAI|2007|Learning Large Scale Common Sense Models of Everyday Life|Recent work has shown promise in using large, publicly available, hand-contributed commonsense databases as joint models that can be used to infer human state from day-to-day sensor data.

These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate. Combined with a content-driven Web page clustering technique, our heuristic search system significantly improves the clustering results.|Ron Bekkerman,Shlomo Zilberstein,James Allan","65398|AAAI|2005|The Max Armed Bandit A New Model of Exploration Applied to Search Heuristic Selection|The multiarmed bandit is often used as an analogy for the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in search problems. The classic problem involves allocating trials to the arms of a multiarmed slot machine to maximize the expected sum of rewards. We pose a new variation of the multiarmed bandit--the Max K-Armed Bandit--in which trials must be allocated among the arms to maximize the expected best single sample reward of the series of trials. Motivation for the Max K-Armed Bandit is the allocation of restarts among a set of multistart stochastic search algorithms. We present an analysis of this Max K-Armed Bandit showing under certain assumptions that the optimal strategy allocates trials to the observed best arm at a rate increasing double exponentially relative to the other arms. This motivates an exploration strategy that follows a Boltzmann distribution with an exponentially decaying temperature parameter. We compare this exploration policy to policies that allocate trials to the observed best arm at rates faster (and slower) than double exponentially. The results confirm, for two scheduling domains, that the double exponential increase in the rate of allocations to the observed best heuristic outperfonns the other approaches.|Vincent A.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16248|IJCAI|2005|Algebraic Markov Decision Processes|In this paper, we provide an algebraic approach to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which allows a unified treatment of MDPs and includes many existing models (quantitative or qualitative) as particular cases.

We recast the problem of finding an optimal policy at a finite horizon as an algebraic path problem in a decision rule graph where arcs are valued by functions, which justifies the use of the Jacobi algorithm to solve algebraic Bellman equations. In order to show the potential of this general approach, we exhibit new variations of MDPs, admitting complete or partial preference structures, as well as probabilistic or possibilistic representation of uncertainty.|Patrice Perny,Olivier Spanjaard,Paul Weng","16409|IJCAI|2007|Topological Value Iteration Algorithm for Markov Decision Processes|Value Iteration is an inefficient algorithm for Markov decision processes (MDPs) because it puts the majority of its effort into backing up the entire state space, which turns out to be unnecessary in many cases. In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal. Our experimental results show that TVI outperforms VI, LAO, LRTDP and HDP on our benchmark MDPs.|Peng Dai,Judy Goldsmith","66010|AAAI|2007|A Unification of Extensive-Form Games and Markov Decision Processes|We describe a generalization of extensive-form games that greatly increases representational power while still allowing efficient computation in the zero-sum setting.

The possibly-infinite action sets mean we must \"forget\" the exact action taken (feasible solution to the optimization problem), remembering instead only some statistic sufficient for playing the rest of the game optimally. Our new model provides an exponentially smaller representation for some games in particular, we show how to compactly represent (and solve) extensive-form games with outcome uncertainty and a generalization of Markov decision processes to multi-stage adversarial planning games.|H.

Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming. We illustrate this approach on a few domains and compare it with other exploration algorithms.|Pablo Samuel Castro,Doina Precup","65491|AAAI|2005|NavBot The Navigational Search-and-Rescue Robot|The Stony Brook Robot Design Team has focused on two main areas of research in the creation of NavBot, our new robot created for the American Association of Artificial Intelligence's (AAAI) Scavenger Hunt Event navigation and computer vision.

This makes such systems particularly interesting because they can tolerate faults, and are able to cope with dynamic environments. We propose the first self stabilizing mechanism for multiagent combinatorial optimization, which works on general networks and stabilizes in a state corresponding to the optimal solution of the optimization problem. Our algorithm is based on dynamic programming, and requires a linear number of messages to find the optimal solution in the absence of faults. We show how our algorithm can be made super-stabilizing, in the sense that while transiting from one stable state to the next, our system preserves the assignments from the previous optimal state, until the new optimal solution is found. We offer equal bounds for the stabilization and the superstabilization time. Furthermore, we describe a general scheme for fault containment and fast response time upon low impact failures. Multiple, isolated failures are handled effectively.

XRPC enhances the existing concept of XQuery functions with the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) paradigm. By calling out of an XQuery for-loop to multiple destinations, and by calling functions that themselves perform XRPC calls, complex PP communication patterns can be achieved. The XRPC extension is orthogonal to all XQuery features, including the XQuery Update Facility (XQUF). We provide formal semantics for XRPC that encompasses execution of both read-only and update queries. XRPC is also a network SOAP sub-protocol, that integrates seamlessly with web services and Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), and AJAX-based GUIs. A crucial feature of the protocol is bulk RPC, that allows remote execution of many different calls to the same procedure, using possibly a single network round-trip. The efficiency potential of XRPC is demonstrated via an open-source implementation in MonetDBXQuery. We show, however, that XRPC is not system-specific every XQuery data source can service XRPC calls using a wrapper. Since XQuery is a pure functional language, we can leverage techniques developed for functional query decomposition to rewrite data shipping queries into XRPC-based function shipping queries. Powerful distributed database techniques (such as semi-join optimizations) directly map on bulk RPC, opening up interesting future work opportunities.|Ying Zhang,Peter A.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","65528|AAAI|2005|SenseRelate  TargetWord-A Generalized Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation|Many words in natural language have different meanings when used in different contexts.

Using a blocks world domain, we show how generalized predictions about the future can compactly capture relations between objects, which in turn can be used to naturally specify relational-style options and policies.

A rough estimate generated quickly is more valuable and useful than a detailed analysis, which might be unnecessary, impractical, or impossible because the situation does not provide enough time, information, or other resources to perform one. Such reasoning is a key component of commonsense reasoning about everyday physical situations.

However, it is possible to diagnose such failures using a model of the coordination between agents.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16248|IJCAI|2005|Algebraic Markov Decision Processes|In this paper, we provide an algebraic approach to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which allows a unified treatment of MDPs and includes many existing models (quantitative or qualitative) as particular cases.

User assistance is automatically achieved by balancing the benefits of improving user performance and the costs of performing user assistance. In addition, a non-invasive real-time system is built to validate the proposed framework. Utilizing the evidences from four modalities (physical appearance features, physiological measures, user performance and behavioral data), the system can successfully recognize human stress and provide timely and appropriate assistance in a task-specific environment.|Wenhui Liao,Weihong Zhang,Zhiwei Zhu,Qiang Ji"],["65983|AAAI|2007|Active Algorithm Selection|Most previous studies on active learning focused on the problem of model selection, i.e., how to identify the optimal classification model from a family of predefined models using a small, carefully selected training set. In this paper, we address the problem of active algorithm selection. The goal of this problem is to efficiently identify the optimal learning algorithm for a given dataset from a set of algorithms using a small training set. In this study, we present a general framework for active algorithm selection by extending the idea of the Hedge algorithm. It employs the worst case analysis to identify the example that can effectively increase the weighted loss function defined in the Hedge algorithm. We further extend the framework by incorporating the correlation information among unlabeled examples to accurately estimate the change in the weighted loss function, and Maximum Entropy Discrimination to automatically determine the combination weights used by the Hedge algorithm. Our empirical study with the datasets of WCCI  performance prediction challenge shows promising performance of the proposed framework for active algorithm selection.|Feilong Chen,Rong Jin","65480|AAAI|2005|A Fast Arc Consistency Algorithm for n-ary Constraints|The GAC-Scheme has become a popular general purpose algorithm for solving n-ary constraints, although it may scan an exponential number of supporting tuples.

The first one concerns the representation of interventions in possibilistic networks. We provide the counterpart of the \"DO\" operator, recently introduced by Pearl, in possibility theory framework. We then show that interventions can equivalently be represented in different ways in possibilistic causal networks. The second main contribution is a new propagation algorithm for dealing with both observations and interventions. We show that our algorithm only needs a small extra cost for handling interventions and is more appropriate for handling sequences of observations and interventions.|Salem Benferhat,Salma Smaoui","16436|IJCAI|2007|Dynamic Weighting A Search-Based MAP Algorithm for Bayesian Networks|In this paper we propose the Dynamic Weighting A* (DWA*) search algorithm for solving MAP problems in Bayesian networks.

This measure is of great theoretical and practical importance as a tool for tasks such as model selection or data clustering. In the case of multinomial data, computing the modern version of stochastic complexity, defined as the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) criterion, requires computing a sum with an exponential number of terms. Furthermore, in order to apply NML in practice, one often needs to compute a whole table of these exponential sums. In our previous work, we were able to compute this table by a recursive algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to significantly improve the time complexity of this algorithm. The techniques used here are based on the discrete Fourier transformand the convolution theorem.|Petri Kontkanen,Petri Myllym√§ki","66259|AAAI|2007|SUNNY A New Algorithm for Trust Inference in Social Networks Using Probabilistic Confidence Models|In many computing systems, information is produced and processed by many people. Knowing how much a user trusts a source can be very useful for aggregating, filtering, and ordering of information. Furthermore, if trust is used to support decision making, it is important to have an accurate estimate of trust when it is not directly available, as well as a measure of confidence in that estimate. This paper describes a new approach that gives an explicit probabilistic interpretation for confidence in social networks. We describe SUNNY, a new trust inference algorithm that uses a probabilistic sampling technique to estimate our confidence in the trust information from some designated sources. SUNNY computes an estimate of trust based on only those information sources with high confidence estimates. In our experiments, SUNNY produced more accurate trust estimates than the well known trust inference algorithm TIDALTRUST (Golbeck ), demonstrating its effectiveness.|Ugur Kuter,Jennifer Golbeck","16497|IJCAI|2007|Fast Algorithm for Connected Row Convex Constraints|Many interesting tractable problems are identified under the model of Constraint Satisfaction Problems.

These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.|Janusz Marecki,Sven Koenig,Milind Tambe","16135|IJCAI|2005|The COMPSET Algorithm for Subset Selection|Subset selection problems are relevant in many domains.

This makes such systems particularly interesting because they can tolerate faults, and are able to cope with dynamic environments. We propose the first self stabilizing mechanism for multiagent combinatorial optimization, which works on general networks and stabilizes in a state corresponding to the optimal solution of the optimization problem. Our algorithm is based on dynamic programming, and requires a linear number of messages to find the optimal solution in the absence of faults. We show how our algorithm can be made super-stabilizing, in the sense that while transiting from one stable state to the next, our system preserves the assignments from the previous optimal state, until the new optimal solution is found. We offer equal bounds for the stabilization and the superstabilization time. Furthermore, we describe a general scheme for fault containment and fast response time upon low impact failures. Multiple, isolated failures are handled effectively. To show the merits of our approach we report on experiments with practically sized distributed meeting scheduling problems in a multiagent system.|Adrian Petcu,Boi Faltings","16230|IJCAI|2005|Networked Distributed POMDPs A Synergy of Distributed Constraint Optimization and POMDPs|In many real-world multiagent applications such as distributed sensor nets, a network of agents is formed based on each agent's limited interactions with a small number of neighbors.

However, DPOP's memory requirements are exponential in the induced width of the constraint graph, which may be prohibitive for problems with large width. We present MB-DPOP, a new hybrid algorithm that can operate with bounded memory. In areas of low width, MB-DPOP operates like standard DPOP (linear number of messages). Areas of high width are explored with bounded propagations using the idea of cycle-cuts Dechter, . We introduce novel DFS-based mechanisms for determining the cycle-cutset, and for grouping cycle-cut nodes into clusters. We use caching (Darwiche, ) between clusters to reduce the complexity to exponential in the largest number of cycle cuts in a single cluster.
