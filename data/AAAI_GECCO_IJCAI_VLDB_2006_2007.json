The constrained single-objective optimizer required by the -constraint method, is the cultured differential evolution, which is an efficient approach for approximating the global optimum of a problem with a low number of fitness function evaluations.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa","57612|GECCO|2006|A new hybrid evolutionary algorithm for the huge -cardinality tree problem|In recent years it has been shown that an intelligent combination of metaheuristics with other optimization techniques can significantly improve over the application of a pure metaheuristic.

From that point of view SWO makes a number of design decisions that are at odds with the conventional wisdom of evolutionary algorithms, but not for any clear reasons. This suggests the possibility of improving on SWO by incorporating aspects of Genetic Algorithms that are known to be effective.

However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction.

Unfortunately, even approximate planning in POMDPs is known to be hard, and developing heuristic planners that can deliver reasonable results in practice has proved to be a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to approximate value-iteration for POMDP planning that is based on quadratic rather than piecewise linear function approximators. Specifically, we approximate the optimal value function by a convex upper bound composed of a fixed number of quadratics, and optimize it at each stage by semidefinite programming. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive approximation quality to current techniques while still maintaining a bounded size representation of the function approximator. Moreover, an upper bound on the optimal value function can be preserved if required. Overall, the technique requires computation time and space that is only linear in the number of iterations (horizon time).|Tao Wang,Pascal Poupart,Michael H.

We show that when agents' initial beliefs satisfy a truth compatibility condition, their behavior converges to a subjective -equilibrium in a finite time, and subjective equilibrium in the limit. This result is a generalization of a similar result in repeated games, to partially observable stochastic games. However, it turns out that the equilibrating process is difficult to demonstrate computationally because of the difficulty in coming up with initial beliefs that are both natural and satisfy the truth compatibility condition. Our results, therefore, shed some negative light on using equilibria as a solution concept for decision making in partially observable stochastic games.|Prashant Doshi,Piotr J.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","65906|AAAI|2006|Point-based Dynamic Programming for DEC-POMDPs|We introduce point-based dynamic programming (DP) for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDPs), a new discrete DP algorithm for planning strategies for cooperative multi-agent systems.

Building on this insight, we then show how the linear programming part in current multi-agent DP algorithms can be avoided, and how multi-agent DP can thus be applied to solve larger problems.

This paper describes initial research into the construction of an SCA that engages in dialog about collaborative physical tasks, in which agents engage in dialog with the joint goal of manipulating the physical context in some manner. Constructing an SCA that can interact naturally in such tasks requires an agent with the ability to interleave planning, action, and observation while operating in a partially observable environment. Consequently, I propose to model an SCA as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).|William Thompson","66064|AAAI|2007|Optimizing Anthrax Outbreak Detection Using Reinforcement Learning|The potentially catastrophic impact of a bioterrorist attack makes developing effective detection methods essential for public health.

The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision.

Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining.

Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities. Missing this opportunity will be worse than missing the Internet. The semantic web will become the means by which information is accessed and managed with modest projections of  billion pages with hundreds of triples per page - the largest distributed system in the world - the only one.

Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model. Syntactic and hypernym features can enhance the performance significantly.|Xiangyu Duan,Jun Zhao,Bo Xu","80621|VLDB|2006|Containment of Conjunctive Object Meta-Queries|We consider the problem of query containment over an object data model derived from F-logic. F-logic has generated considerable interest commercially, in the academia, and within various standardization efforts as a means for building ontologies and for reasoning on the Semantic Web. Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature. We show that, even for queries over meta-information together with data, this problem is decidable for non-recursive conjunctive queries.

In the case of anthrax attack, a delay of hours in making a right decision can lead to hundreds of lives lost. Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision. We present empirical evidence illustrating that the performance of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and timeliness is improved significantly by utilizing POMDPs.|Masoumeh T.

Evolutionary computation is one of the most promising approaches to reinforcement learning but its success is largely restricted to off-line scenarios. In on-line scenarios, an agent must strive to maximize the reward it accrues while it is learning. Temporal difference (TD) methods, another approach to reinforcement learning, naturally excel in on-line scenarios because they have selection mechanisms for balancing the need to search for better policies exploration) with the need to accrue maximal reward (exploitation). This paper presents a novel way to strike this balance in evolutionary methods by borrowing the selection mechanisms used by TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolution to choose policies for evaluation. Empirical results in the mountain car and server job scheduling domains demonstrate that these techniques can substantially improve evolution's on-line performance in stochastic domains.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone","66169|AAAI|2007|Temporal Difference and Policy Search Methods for Reinforcement Learning An Empirical Comparison|Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have become popular in recent years because of their ability to solve complex tasks with minimal feedback.

Whereas social laws need to be enforced in a top-down manner, norms evolve in a bottom-up manner and are typically more self-enforcing. While effective norms can significantly enhance performance of individual agents and agent societies, there has been little work in multiagent systems on the formation of social norms. We propose a model that supports the emergence of social norms via learning from interaction experiences. In our model, individual agents repeatedly interact with other agents in the society over instances of a given scenario. Each interaction is framed as a stage game. An agent learns its policy to play the game over repeated interactions with multiple agents. We term this mode of learning social learning, which is distinct from an agent learning from repeated interactions against the same player. We are particularly interested in situations where multiple action combinations yield the same optimal payoff. The key research question is to find out if the entire population learns to converge to a consistent norm. In addition to studying such emergence of social norms among homogeneous learners via social learning, we study the effects of heterogeneous learners, population size, multiple social groups, etc.|Sandip Sen,Stéphane Airiau","16706|IJCAI|2007|A Model for Collective Strategy Diffusion in Agent Social Law Evolution|Social law is perceived as evolving through the competition of individual social strategies held by the agents.

To demonstrate our approach, we use behaviosites to control the behavior of a swarm of simple agents. With a relatively low infection rate, a few behaviosites can engender desired behavior over the swarm as a whole keeping it in one place, leading it through checkpoints, or moving the swarm from one stable equilibrium to another.

It has been shown in the literature that the point of convergence and motion of a swarm of autonomous mobile agents can be controlled by using cyclic pursuit laws. In cyclic pursuit, there exists a predefined cyclic connection between agents and each agent pursues the next agent in the cycle. In this paper we generalize this idea to a case where an agent pursues a point which is the weighted average of the positions of the remaining agents. This point correspond to a particular pursuit sequence. Using this concept of centroidal cyclic pursuit, the behavior of the agents is analyzed such that, by suitably selecting the agents' gain, the rendezvous point of the agents can be controlled, directed linear motion of the agents can be achieved, and the trajectories of the agents can be changed by switching between the pursuit sequences keeping some of the behaviors of the agents invariant.

We apply these measures to several known ranking systems, such as PageRank, and prove tight bounds on the level of incentive compatibility under two basic properties strong monotonicity and non-imposition. We also introduce two novel nonimposing ranking systems, one general, and the other for the case of systems with three participants.

One voting rule of particular interest is the Kemeny rule, which minimizes the number of cases where the final ranking disagrees with a vote on the order of two alternatives. Unfortunately, Kemeny rankings are NP-hard to compute. Recent work on computing Kemeny rankings has focused on producing good bounds to use in search-based methods. In this paper, we extend on this work by providing various improved bounding techniques. Some of these are based on cycles in the pairwise majority graph, others are based on linear programs. We completely characterize the relative strength of all of these bounds and provide some experimental results.|Vincent Conitzer,Andrew J.

An agent's preference ordering may be incomplete because, for example, there is an ongoing preference elicitation process. It may also contain incomparability as this is useful, for example, in multi-criteria scenarios. We focus on the problem of computing the possible and necessary winners, that is, those outcomes which can be or always are the most preferred for the agents. Possible and necessary winners are useful in many scenarios including preference elicitation. First we show that computing the sets of possible and necessary winners is in general a difficult problem as is providing a good approximation of such sets. Then we identify general properties of the preference aggregation function which are sufficient for such sets to be computed in polynomial time. Finally, we show how possible and necessary winners can be used to focus preference elicitation.|Maria Silvia Pini,Francesca Rossi,Kristen Brent Venable,Toby Walsh","16778|IJCAI|2007|Winner Determination in Sequential Majority Voting|Preferences can be aggregated using voting rules.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm","16705|IJCAI|2007|Vote and Aggregation in Combinatorial Domains with Structured Preferences|In many real-world collective decision problems, the set of alternatives is a Cartesian product of finite value domains for each of a given set of variables.

In this paper, we show that this approach can also be used to reduce the number of slow synchronization operations needed in parallel graph search.

For cost-optimal planning, however, existing admissible heuristics are generally too weak to effectively guide the search. Pattern database heuristics (PDBs), which are based on abstractions of the search space, are currently one of the most promising approaches to developing better admissible heuristics. The informedness of PDB heuristics depends crucially on the selection of appropriate abstractions (patterns). Although PDBs have been applied to many search problems, including planning, there are not many insights into how to select good patterns, even manually. What constitutes a good pattern depends on the problem domain, making the task even more difficult for domain-independent planning, where the process needs to be completely automatic and generaL We present a novel way of constructing good patterns automatically from the specification of planning problem instances. We demonstrate that this allows a domain-independent planner to solve planning problems optimally in some very challenging domains, including a STRIPS formulation of the Sokoban puzzle.|Patrik Haslum,Adi Botea,Malte Helmert,Blai Bonet,Sven Koenig","57789|GECCO|2006|Optimising cancer chemotherapy using an estimation of distribution algorithm and genetic algorithms|This paper presents a methodology for using heuristic search methods to optimise cancer chemotherapy.

For graphs with sufficient locality, structured duplicate detection outperforms other approaches to external-memory graph search. We develop an automatic method for creating an abstract representation that reveals the local structure of a graph. We then integrate this approach into a domain-independent STRIPS planner and show that it dramatically improves scalability for a wide range of planning problems.

The problem of planning with TEGs is of renewed interest because it is at the core of planning with temporal preferences. Currently, the fastest domain-independent classical planners employ some kind of heuristic search. However, existing planners for TEGs are not heuristic and are only able to prune the search space by progressing the TEG. In this paper we propose a method for planning with TEGs using heuristic search. We represent TEGs using a rich and compelling subset of a first-order linear temporal logic. We translate a planning problem with TEGs to a classical planning problem. With this translation in hand, we exploit heuristic search to determine a plan. Our translation relies on the construction of a parameterized nondeterministic finite automaton for the TEG. We have proven the correctness of our algorithm and analyzed the complexity of the resulting representation. The translator is fully implemented and available.

Then, an adaptive variance scaling theme is introduced that aims at reducing the risk of premature convergence. Integrating the scheme into the iterated density--estimation evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) yields the correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA (CT-AVS-IDEA). The CT-AVS-IDEA is compared to the original IDEA and the Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) on a wide range of unimodal test-problems by means of a scalability analysis. It is found that the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality, competitively with the CMA-ES.

The LaSO approach uses discriminative learning to optimize heuristic functions for search-based computation of structured outputs and has shown promising results in a number of domains. However, the search problems that arise in AI planning tend to be qualitatively very different from those considered in structured classification, which raises a number of potential difficulties in directly applying LaSO to planning. In this paper, we discuss these issues and describe a LaSO-based approach for discriminative learning of beam-search heuristics in AI planning domains. We give convergence results for this approach and present experiments in several benchmark domains. The results show that the discriminatively trained heuristic can outperform the one used by the planner FF and another recent non-discriminative learning approach.|Yuehua Xu,Alan Fern,Sung Wook Yoon"],["80835|VLDB|2007|Ad-hoc Top-k Query Answering for Data Streams|A top-k query retrieves the k highest scoring tuples from a data set with respect to a scoring function defined on the attributes of a tuple. The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries. A thorough experimental study evaluates the efficiency of the proposed technique.|Gautam Das,Dimitrios Gunopulos,Nick Koudas,Nikos Sarkas","80757|VLDB|2007|On the Production of Anorexic Plan Diagrams|A \"plan diagram\" is a pictorial enumeration of the execution plan choices of a database query optimizer over the relational selectivity space. We have shown recently that, for industrial-strength database engines, these diagrams are often remarkably complex and dense, with a large number of plans covering the space. However, they can often be reduced to much simpler pictures, featuring significantly fewer plans, without materially affecting the query processing quality. Plan reduction has useful implications for the design and usage of query optimizers, including quantifying redundancy in the plan search space, enhancing useability of parametric query optimization, identifying error-resistant and least-expected-cost plans, and minimizing the overheads of multi-plan approaches. We investigate here the plan reduction issue from theoretical, statistical and empirical perspectives. Our analysis shows that optimal plan reduction, w.r.t. minimizing the number of plans, is an NP-hard problem in general, and remains so even for a storage-constrained variant. We then present a greedy reduction algorithm with tight and optimal performance guarantees, whose complexity scales linearly with the number of plans in the diagram for a given resolution. Next, we devise fast estimators for locating the best tradeoff between the reduction in plan cardinality and the impact on query processing quality. Finally, extensive experimentation with a suite of multi-dimensional TPCH-based query templates on industrial-strength optimizers demonstrates that complex plan diagrams easily reduce to \"anorexic\" (small absolute number of plans) levels incurring only marginal increases in the estimated query processing costs.|Harish D.,Pooja N.

One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

The increasing popularity of this query paradigm has led to the introduction of specialized rank join operators that integrate the selection of top tuples with join processing. These operators access just \"enough\" of the input in order to generate just \"enough\" output and can offer significant speed-ups for query evaluation. The number of input tuples that an operator accesses is called the input depth of the operator, and this is the driving cost factor in rank join processing. This introduces the important problem of depth estimation, which is crucial for the costing of rank join operators during query compilation and thus for their integration in optimized physical plans. We introduce an estimation methodology, termed Deep, for approximating the input depths of rank join operators in a physical execution plan. At the core of Deep lies a general, principled framework that formalizes depth computation in terms of the joint distribution of scores in the base tables. This framework results in a systematic estimation methodology that takes the characteristics of the data directly into account and thus enables more accurate estimates. We develop novel estimation algorithms that provide an efficient realization of the formal Deep framework, and describe their integration on top of the statistics module of an existing query optimizer. We validate the performance of Deep with an extensive experimental study on data sets of varying characteristics. The results verify the effectiveness of Deep as an estimation method and demonstrate its advantages over previously proposed techniques.|Karl Schnaitter,Joshua Spiegel,Neoklis Polyzotis","80685|VLDB|2006|Towards Robustness in Query Auditing|We consider the online query auditing problem for statistical databases.

In many cases, a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results.

We define a rank-aware measure for the cube, capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional ranking analysis. Based on the ranking cube, an efficient query algorithm is developed which progressively retrieves data blocks until the top-k results are found. The curse of dimensionality is a well-known challenge for the data cube and we cope with this difficulty by introducing a new technique of ranking fragments.

In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries.

Most existing work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem, which considers the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set of features. Such an approach has two drawbacks ) it leaves many partial similarities uncovered ) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the k-n-match problem in this paper.The k-n-match problem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the data objects in n dimensions, where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and these n dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objects returned in the answer set match best. The k-n-match query is expected to be superior to the kNN query in discovering partial similarities, however, it may not be as good in identifying full similarity since a single value of n may only correspond to a particular aspect of an object instead of the entirety. To address this problem, we further introduce the frequent k-n-match problem, which finds a set of objects that appears in the k-n-match answers most frequently for a range of n values. Moreover, we propose search algorithms for both problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of individual attributes retrieved, which is especially useful for information retrieval from multiple systems. We can also apply the proposed algorithmic strategy to achieve a disk based algorithm for the (frequent) k-n-match query. By a thorough experimental study using both real and synthetic data sets, we show that ) the k-n-match query yields better result than the kNN query in identifying similar objects by partial similarities ) our proposed method (for processing the frequent k-n-match query) outperforms existing techniques for similarity search in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.|Anthony K.

The new results include reasoning about service behavior under more general sets of constraints and extension of the framework towards conditional control and data flow---two crucial aspect that were missing in previous logical formalizations.|Dumitru Roman,Michael Kifer","16730|IJCAI|2007|Exploiting Image Contents in Web Search|Web search is a challenging task. Previous research mainly exploits texts on the Web pages or link information between the pages, while multimedia information is largely ignored. This paper proposes a new framework for Web search, which exploits image contents to help improve the search performance. In this framework, candidate images are retrieved at first by considering their associated text information. Then, images related to the query are identified by analyzing the density of the visual feature space. After that, an image-based rank of the Web pages is generated, which is combined with the traditional keyword-based search result to produce the final search result. Experiments demonstrate the promise of the proposed framework.|Zhi-Hua Zhou,Hong-Bin Dai","65929|AAAI|2006|Improve Web Search Using Image Snippets|The Web has become the largest information repository in the world thus, effectively and efficiently searching the Web becomes a key challenge. Interactive Web search divides the search process into several rounds, and for each round the search engine interacts with the user for more knowledge of the user's information requirement. Previous research mainly uses the text information on Web pages, while little attention is paid to other modalities. This article shows that Web search performance can be significantly improved if imagery is considered in interactive Web search. Compared with text, imagery has its own advantage the time for &ldquoreading&rdquo an image is as little as that for reading one or two words, while the information brought by an image is as much as that conveyed by a whole passage of text. In order to exploit the advantages of imagery, a novel interactive Web search framework is proposed, where image snippets are first extracted from Web pages and then provided, along with the text snippets, to the user for result presentation and relevance feedback, as well as being presented alone to the user for image suggestion. User studies show that it is more convenient for the user to identify the Web pages he or she expects and to reformulate the initial query. Further experiments demonstrate the promise of introducing multimodal techniques into the proposed interactive Web search framework.|Xiao-Bing Xue,Zhi-Hua Zhou,Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang","66002|AAAI|2007|Towards Efficient Dominant Relationship Exploration of the Product Items on the Web|In recent years, there has been a prevalence of search engines being employed to find useful information in the Web as they efficiently explore hyperlinks between web pages which define a natural graph structure that yields a good ranking. Unfortunately, current search engines cannot effectively rank those relational data, which exists on dynamic websites supported by online databases. In this study, to rank such structured data (i.e., find the \"best\" items), we propose an integrated online system consisting of compressed data structure to encode the dominant relationship of the relational data. Efficient querying strategies and updating scheme are devised to facilitate the ranking process. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.

While entities appear in many pages, current engines only find each page individually. Toward searching directly and holistically for finding information of finer granularity, we study the problem of entity search, a significant departure from traditional document retrieval. We focus on the core challenge of ranking entities, by distilling its underlying conceptual model Impression Model and developing a probabilistic ranking framework, EntityRank, that is able to seamlessly integrate both local and global information in ranking.

Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables.\" We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than  million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.|Daniel J.

Data management continues to grow, more than doubling in data and transaction volumes every two years with a growth in deployments to fuel a $ billion market. A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications. While data management growth will continue based primarily on the relational data model and conventional DBMSs, a much larger and more challenging data management world is emerging. In the 's data under DBMS management reached % of the world's data. The six-fold growth of non-relational data in the period -- will reduce that number to well below %.

Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities.

Viewing software components as web services, the current solutions to web services composition based on business web services (using WSDL, BPEL, SOAP etc.) or semantic web services (using ontologies, goal-directed reasoning etc.) are both piecemeal and insufficient for building practical applications. Inspired by the work in Al planning on decoupling causal (planning) and resource reasoning (scheduling), we introduced the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the current approaches. The solution is based on a novel two-staged composition approach that addresses the information modeling aspects of web services, provides support for contextual information while composing services, employs efficient decoupling of functional and non-functional requirements, and leads to improved scalability and failure handling. A prototype of the solution has been implemented in the Synthy service composition system and applied to a number of composition scenarios from the telecom domain.

To model a service, the user has to specify semantic types of the input and output data it uses and its functionality. As large number of new services come online, it is impractical to require the user to come up with a semantic model of the service or rely on the service providers to conform to a standard. Instead, we would like to automatically learn the semantic model of a new service. This paper addresses one part of the problem namely, automatically recognizing semantic types of the data used by Web services. We describe a metadata-based classification method for recognizing input data types using only the terms extracted from a Web Service Definition file. We then verify the classifier's predictions by invoking the service with some sample data of that type. Once we discover correct classification, we invoke the service to produce output data samples. We then use content-based classifiers to recognize semantic types of the output data. We provide performance results of both classification methods and validate our approach on several live Web services.|Kristina Lerman,Anon Plangprasopchok,Craig A.

Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature.

In doing so we gain insight into how the GA makes use of crossover during its traversal of the sl-hdf search space. We begin this paper by explaining the sl-hdf's. We then conduct a series of experiments with various crossover rates and various rates of environmental change. Our results show that the GA performs better with than without crossover in dynamic environments. Though these results have been shown on some static functions in the past, they are re-confirmed and expanded here for a new type of function (the hdf) and a new type of environment (dynamic environments).

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries. A thorough experimental study evaluates the efficiency of the proposed technique.|Gautam Das,Dimitrios Gunopulos,Nick Koudas,Nikos Sarkas","80791|VLDB|2007|Randomized Algorithms for Data Reconciliation in Wide Area Aggregate Query Processing|Many aspects of the data integration problem have been considered in the literature how to match schemas across different data sources, how to decide when different records refer to the same entity, how to efficiently perform the required entity resolution in a batch fashion, and so on.

This novel context poses an original combination of challenges that has not been addressed before (i) sufficient expressive power of the DL to capture common data modeling constructs (ii) well established and flexible query mechanisms such as Conjunctive Queries (CQs) (iii) optimization of inference techniques with respect to data size, which typically dominates the size of ontologies. This calls for investigating data complexity of query answering in expressive DLs. While the complexity of DLs has been studied extensively, data complexity has been characterized only for answering atomic queries, and was still open for answering CQs in expressive DLs. We tackle this issue and prove a tight CONP upper bound for the problem in SHIQ, as long as no transitive roles occur in the query. We thus establish that for a whole range of DLs from AL to SHIQ, answering CQs with no transitive roles has CONP-complete data complexity. We obtain our result by a novel tableaux-based algorithm for checking query entailment, inspired by the one in , but which manages the technical challenges of simultaneous inverse roles and number restrictions (which leads to a DL lacking the finite model property).|Magdalena Ortiz,Diego Calvanese,Thomas Eiter","65685|AAAI|2006|Overlapping Coalition Formation for Efficient Data Fusion in Multi-Sensor Networks|This paper develops new algorithms for coalition formation within multi-sensor networks tasked with performing wide-area surveillance. Specifically, we cast this application as an instance of coalition formation, with overlapping coalitions. We show that within this application area subadditive coalition valuations are typical, and we thus use this structural property of the problem to derive two novel algorithms (an approximate greedy one that operates in polynomial time and has a calculated bound to the optimum, and an optimal branch-and-bound one) to find the optimal coalition structure in this instance. We empirically evaluate the performance of these algorithms within a generic model of a multi-sensor network performing wide area surveillance. These results show that the polynomial algorithm typically generated solutions much closer to the optimal than the theoretical bound, and prove the effectiveness of our pruning procedure.|Viet Dung Dang,Rajdeep K.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","66198|AAAI|2007|Mapping and Revising Markov Logic Networks for Transfer Learning|Transfer learning addresses the problem of how to leverage knowledge acquired in a source domain to improve the accuracy and speed of learning in a related target domain.

This work generally assumes that the size of the market (number of bidders) is known a priori, but that the mechanism designer has no knowledge of the distribution of bid values. However, in many real-world applications (such as online ticket sales), the opposite is true the seller has distributional knowledge of the bid values (e.g., via the history of past transactions in the market), but there is uncertainty about market size. Adopting the perspective of automated mechanism design, introduced by Conitzer and Sandholm, we develop algorithms that compute an optimal, or approximately optimal, online auction mechanism given access to this distributional knowledge. Our main results are twofold. First, we show that when the seller does not know the market size, no constant-approximation to the optimum efficiency or revenue is achievable in the worst case, even under the very strong assumption that bid values are i.i.d. samples from a distribution known to the seller. Second, we show that when the seller has distributional knowledge of the market size as well as the bid values, one can do well in several senses. Perhaps most interestingly, by combining dynamic programming with prophet inequalities (a technique from optimal stopping theory) we are able to design and analyze online mechanisms which are temporally strategyproof (even with respect to arrival and departure times) and approximately efficiency (revenue)-maximizing. In exploring the interplay between automated mechanism design and prophet inequalities, we prove new prophet inequalities motivated by the auction setting.|Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi,Robert D.

We then propose a class of partial revelation mechanisms that achieve approximate dominant strategy implementation, and describe a computationally tractable algorithm for myopically optimizing the partitioning of each agent's type space to reduce manipulability and social welfare loss.

In this paper we specificallyfocus on one way of scaling that was previouslyintroduced as Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS). It wasfound that when using AVS, the average number offitness evaluations grows subquadratically withthe dimensionality on a wide range of unimodaltest-problems, competitively with the CMA-ES.Still, room for improvement exists because thevariance doesn't always have to be scaled. Apreviously introduced trigger based on correlationthat determines when to apply scaling was shownto fail on higher dimensional problems.

Intuitively put, scaling istriggered with SDR only if improvements are foundto be far away from the mean. SDR works even inhigh dimensions as a result of factorizing thedecision rule behind the trigger according to theestimated Bayesian factorization.

Thus the automated design of mechanisms tailored to specific instances of a decision scenario is an important problem. Existing techniques for automated mechanism design (AMD) require the revelation of full utility information from agents, which can be very difficult in practice. In this work, we study the automated design of mechanisms that only require partial revelation of utilities. Each agent's type space is partitioned into a finite set of partial types, and agents (should) report the partial type within which their full type lies. We provide a set of optimization routines that can be combined to address the trade-offs between the amount of communication, approximation of incentive properties, and objective value achieved by a mechanism. This allows for the automated design of partial revelation mechanisms with worst-case guarantees on incentive properties for any objective function (revenue, social welfare, etc.).|Nathanael Hyafil,Craig Boutilier","57674|GECCO|2006|The correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA|It has previously been shown analytically and experimentally that continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on the normal pdf can easily suffer from premature convergence. This paper takes a principled first step towards solving this problem. First, prerequisites for the successful use of search distributions in EDAs are presented. Then, an adaptive variance scaling theme is introduced that aims at reducing the risk of premature convergence. Integrating the scheme into the iterated density--estimation evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) yields the correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA (CT-AVS-IDEA). The CT-AVS-IDEA is compared to the original IDEA and the Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) on a wide range of unimodal test-problems by means of a scalability analysis. It is found that the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality, competitively with the CMA-ES.

In addition, we improve the AVS schemeusing the Standard-Deviation Ratio(SDR) trigger. Intuitively put, variance scalingis triggered by the SDR trigger only ifimprovements are found to be far awayfrom the mean. For the multi-objective case,this addition is important to keep the variancefrom being scaled to excessively large values.From experiments performed on five well-knownbenchmark problems, the addition of SDR andAVS is found to enlarge the class of problems thatcontinuous multi-objective EDAs can solve reliably.|Peter A.

This process is often guided by similarity measures between images, computed based on the image data. However, in time-critical applications state-of-the-art methods for computing similarity are too slow. Instead of using all the image data to compute similarity, one can use a subset of pixels to improve the speed, but often this comes at the cost of reduced accuracy. This makes the problem of image alignment a natural application domain for deliberation control using anytime algorithms. However, almost no research has been done in this direction. In this paper, we present anytime versions for the computation of two common image similarity measures mean squared difference and mutual information. Off-line, we learn a performance profile specific to each measure, which is then used on-line to select the appropriate amount of pixels to process at each optimization step.

Given a query and a view, the QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways (i) find an equivalent rewriting of the query using only the view, or (ii) find a maximal contained rewriting using only the view. The former is appropriate for classical query optimization and was recently studied by Xu and Ozsoyoglu for tree pattern queries (TP). However, for information integration, we cannot rely on equivalent rewriting and must instead use maximal contained rewriting as shown by Halevy. Motivated by this, we study maximal contained rewriting for TP, a core subset of XPath, both in the absence and presence of a schema. In the absence of a schema, we show there are queries whose maximal contained rewriting (MCR) can only be expressed as the union of exponentially many TPs. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting and give a polynomial time algorithm for testing the existence of an MCR. We also give an algorithm for generating the MCR when one exists. We then consider QAV in the presence of a schema. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting when the schema contains no recursion or union types, and show that it consists of at most one TP. We give an efficient polynomial time algorithm for generating the maximal contained rewriting whenever it exists. Finally, we discuss QAV in the presence of recursive schemas.|Laks V. S.

Previous research mainly uses the text information on Web pages, while little attention is paid to other modalities. This article shows that Web search performance can be significantly improved if imagery is considered in interactive Web search.

In order to exploit the advantages of imagery, a novel interactive Web search framework is proposed, where image snippets are first extracted from Web pages and then provided, along with the text snippets, to the user for result presentation and relevance feedback, as well as being presented alone to the user for image suggestion. User studies show that it is more convenient for the user to identify the Web pages he or she expects and to reformulate the initial query.

Thus, writing IE programs this way retains and enhances the important advantages of current approaches programs are easy to understand, debug, and modify. Second, once we write IE programs in this framework, we can apply query optimization techniques to them. This gives programs that, when run over a variety of data sets, are more efficient than any monolithic program because they are optimized based on the statistics of the data on which they are invoked. We show how optimizing such programs raises challenges specific to text data that cannot be accommodated in the current relational optimization framework, then provide initial solutions. Extensive experiments over real-world data demonstrate that optimization is indeed vital for IE programs and that we can effectively optimize IE programs written in this proposed framework.|Warren Shen,AnHai Doan,Jeffrey F.

Our proposed method first anchors the appearance of entities in Wikipedia articles using some heuristic rules that are supported by their encyclopedic style. Therefore, it uses neither the Named Entity Recognizer (NER) nor the Coreference Resolution tool, which are sources of errors for relation extraction. It then classifies the relationships among entity pairs using SVM with features extracted from the web structure and subtrees mined from the syntactic structure of text. The innovations behind our work are the following a) our method makes use of Wikipedia characteristics for entity allocation and entity classification, which are essential for relation extraction b) our algorithm extracts a core tree, which accurately reflects a relationship between a given entity pair, and subsequently identifies key features with respect to the relationship from the core tree.

Traditionally, information extraction proceeds by first segmenting each candidate record separately, and then merging records that refer to the same entities. While computationally efficient, this approach is suboptimal, because it ignores the fact that segmenting one candidate record can help to segment similar ones. For example, resolving a well-segmented field with a less-clear one can disambiguate the latter's boundaries. In this paper we propose a joint approach to information extraction, where segmentation of all records and entity resolution are performed together in a single integrated inference process. While a number of previous authors have taken steps in this direction (eg., Pasula et al. (), Wellner et al. ()), to our knowledge this is the first fully joint approach.

While any search space can be observed at any scale according to the level of details, there is nothing inherent to the classical metaheuristics to naturally account for this multi-scaling. Nevertheless, the wider the search space the longer the time needed by any metaheuristic to discover and exploit the \"promising\" zones. Any possibility to compress this time is welcome. Abstracting the search space during the search is one such possibility. For instance, a common Ordering Genetic Algorithm (o-GA) is not well suited to efficiently resolve very large instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The mechanism presented here (reminiscent of Gestalt psychology) aims at abstracting the search space by substituting the variables of the problems with macro-versions of them. This substitution allows any given metaheuristic to tackle the problem at various scales or through different multi-resolution lenses. In the TSP problem to be treated here, the towns will simply be aggregated into regions and the metaheuristics will apply on this new one-level-up search space. The whole problem becomes now how to discover the most appropriate regions and to merge this discovery with the running of the o-GA at the new level.|Christophe Philemotte,Hugues Bersini","16522|IJCAI|2007|A Multiobjective Frontier Search Algorithm|The paper analyzes the extension of frontier search to the multiobjective framework.

A greedy heuristic for this NP-hard problem greedily chooses labels so as to reduce the number of components in the subgraphs they induce as quickly as possible. A genetic algorithm for the problem encodes candidate solutions as per mutations of the labels an initial segment of such a chromosome lists the labels that appear on the edges in the chromosome's tree. Three versions of the GA apply generic or heuristic crossover and mutation operators and a local search step. In tests on  randomly-generated instances of the minimum-label spanning tree problem, versions of the GA that apply generic operators, with and without the local search step, perform less well than the greedy heuristic, but a version that applies the local search step and operators tailored to the problem returns solutions that require on average  fewer labels than the heuristic's.|Jeremiah Nummela,Bryant A.

Recently multiagent researchers have adopted the CTMS language as a standard for multiagent task scheduling. We contribute an automated mapping that transforms CTMS into a DCOP. Further, we propose a set of representational compromises for CTMS that allow existing distributed algorithms for DCOP to be immediately brought to bear on CTMS problems. Next, we demonstrate a key advantage of a constraint based representation is the ability to leverage the representation to do efficient solving. We contribute a set of pre-processing algorithms that leverage existing constraint propagation techniques to do variable domain pruning on the DCOP. We show that these algorithms can result in % reduction in state space size for a given set of CTMS problems. Finally, we demonstrate up to a % increase in the ability to optimally solve CTMS problems in a reasonable amount of time and in a distributed manner as a result of applying our mapping and domain pruning algorithms.|Evan Sultanik,Pragnesh Jay Modi,William C.

Tree and graph encodings are similar in application but offer distinct advantages and disadvantages in genetic programming. We describe two implementations and discuss their evolvability. We then compare performance using symbolic regression on hundreds of random nonlinear target functions of both -dimensional and -dimensional cases. Results show the graph encoding has less bias for bloating solutions but is slower to converge and deleterious crossovers are more frequent. The graph encoding however is found to have computational benefits, suggesting it to be an advantageous trade-off between regression performance and computational effort.|Michael D.

Given an undirected graph G with node and edge weights, this problem consists of finding a tree in G with exactly k edges such that the sum of the weights is minimal. The genetic operators of our algorithm are based on an existing dynamic programming algorithm from the literature for finding optimal subtrees in a given tree.

We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model.

The most obvious way to do so is to remove just enough Tbox sentences to eliminate the errors.

Such a knowledge base is constituted by two components, called TBox and ABox. The former expresses general knowledge about the concepts and their relationships, whereas the latter describes the state of affairs regarding the instances of concepts. We investigate the case where the update affects only the instance level of the ontology, i.e., the ABox. Building on classical approaches on knowledge base update, our first contribution is to provide a general semantics for instance level update in Description Logics. We then focus on DL-Lite, a specific Description Logic where the basic reasoning tasks are computationally tractable. We show that DL-Lite is closed with respect to instance level update, in the sense that the result of an update is always expressible as a new DL-Lite ABox. Finally we provide an algorithm that computes the result of an update in DL-Lite, and we show that it runs in polynomial time with respect to the size of both the original knowledge base and the update formula.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Antonella Poggi,Riccardo Rosati","80848|VLDB|2007|Reasoning about the Behavior of Semantic Web Services with Concurrent Transaction Logic|The recent upsurge in the interest in Semantic Web services and the high-profile projects such as the WSMO, OWLS, and SWSL, have drawn attention to the importance of logic-based modeling of the behavior of Web services.

It provides a way for compiling a stratified belief base in order to be able to process inference from it in polynomial time. The resulting extra compilation cost is very low. In particular, the number of additional variables, that are added to original stratified bases, corresponds exactly to the number of priority levels existing in the base.

Although numerous diverse techniques have been proposed, a fast tree-growing algorithm without substantial decrease in accuracy and substantial increase in space complexity is essential. In this paper, we present a novel, fast decision-tree learning algorithm that is based on a conditional independence assumption. The new algorithm has a time complexity of O(m  n), where m is the size of the training data and n is the number of attributes. This is a significant asymptotic improvement over the time complexity O(m  n) of the standard decision-tree learning algorithm C., with an additional space increase of only O(n). Experiments show that our algorithm performs competitively with C. in accuracy on a large number of UCI benchmark data sets, and performs even better and significantly faster than C. on a large number of text classification data sets. The time complexity of our algorithm is as low as naive Bayes'. Indeed, it is as fast as naive Bayes but outperforms naive Bayes in accuracy according to our experiments.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16409|IJCAI|2007|Topological Value Iteration Algorithm for Markov Decision Processes|Value Iteration is an inefficient algorithm for Markov decision processes (MDPs) because it puts the majority of its effort into backing up the entire state space, which turns out to be unnecessary in many cases.

All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal.

We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy.

In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming.

However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted.

OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints.
