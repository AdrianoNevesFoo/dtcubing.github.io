Such agents will need to be able to learn, both in order to correct and circumvent their inevitable imperfections, and to keep up with a dynamically changing world. They will also need to be able to interact with one another, whether they share common goals, they pursue independent goals, or their goals are in direct conflict. This paper presents current research directions in machine learning, multiagent reasoning, and robotics, and advocates their unification within concrete application domains. Ideally, new theoretical results in each separate area will inform practical implementations while innovations from concrete multiagent applications will drive new theoretical pursuits, and together these synergistic research approaches will lead us towards the goal of fully autonomous agents.|Peter Stone","80730|VLDB|2007|Probabilistic Graphical Models and their Role in Databases|Probabilistic graphical models provide a framework for compact representation and efficient reasoning about the joint probability distribution of several interdependent variables. This is a classical topic with roots in statistical physics. In recent years, spurred by several applications in unstructured data integration, sensor networks, image processing, bio-informatics, and code design, the topic has received renewed interest in the machine learning, data mining, and database communities. Techniques from graphical models have also been applied to many topics directly of interest to the database community including information extraction, sensor data analysis, imprecise data representation and querying, selectivity estimation for query optimization, and data privacy. As database research continues to expand beyond the confines of traditional enterprise domains, we expect both the need and applicability of probabilistic graphical models to increase dramatically over the next few years. With this tutorial, we are aiming to provide a foundational overview of probabilistic graphical models to the database community, accompanied by a brief overview of some of the recent research literature on the role of graphical models in databases.|Amol Deshpande,Sunita Sarawagi","66092|AAAI|2007|A Connectionist Cognitive Model for Temporal Synchronisation and Learning|The importance of the efforts towards integrating the symbolic and connectionist paradigms of artificial intelligence has been widely recognised. Integration may lead to more effective and richer cognitive computational models, and to a better understanding of the processes of artificial intelligence across the field. This paper presents a new model for the representation, computation, and learning of temporal logic in connectionist systems. The model allows for the encoding of past and future temporal logic operators in neural networks, through a neural-symbolic translation algorithms introduced in the paper. The networks are relatively simple and can be used for reasoning about time and for learning by examples with the use of standard neural learning algorithms. We validate the model in a well-known application dealing WIth temporal synchronisation in distributed knowledge systems.

However, as we begin creating autonomous agents to operate in the rich environments of modern videogames and computer simulations, it becomes important to devise agent behaviors that display the visible attributes of intelligence, rather than simply performing optimally. Such visibly intelligent behavior is difficult to specify with rules or characterize in terms of quantifiable objective functions, but it is possible to utilize human intuitions to directly guide a learning system toward the desired sorts of behavior. Policy induction from human-generated examples is a promising approach to training such agents. In this paper, such a method is developed and tested using Lamarckian neuroevolution. Artificial neural networks are evolved to control autonomous agents in a strategy game. The evolution is guided by human-generated examples of play, and the system effectively learns the policies that were used by the player to generate the examples. I.e., the agents learn visibly intelligent behavior. In the future, such methods are likely to play a central rule in creating autonomous agents for complex environments, making it possible to generate rich behaviors derived from nothing more formal than the intuitively generated example, of designers, players, or subject-matter experts.|Bobby D. Bryant,Risto Miikkulainen","80761|VLDB|2007|Computer Science  A New World of Data Management|Data management, one of the most successful software technologies, is the bedrock of almost all business, government, and scientific activities, worldwide. Data management continues to grow, more than doubling in data and transaction volumes every two years with a growth in deployments to fuel a $ billion market. A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications. While data management growth will continue based primarily on the relational data model and conventional DBMSs, a much larger and more challenging data management world is emerging. In the 's data under DBMS management reached % of the world's data. The six-fold growth of non-relational data in the period -- will reduce that number to well below %. We are entering the next generation of computing with a fundamentally different computing model and paradigm characterized technologically by multi-core architectures, virtualization, service-oriented computing, and the semantic web. Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities. Missing this opportunity will be worse than missing the Internet. The semantic web will become the means by which information is accessed and managed with modest projections of  billion pages with hundreds of triples per page - the largest distributed system in the world - the only one. Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web Consortium view databases are being nodes that need to be turned inside out. What does the database community think Semantic web services will constitute a programming model of Computer Science .. How does data management fit into this semantically rich environment Computer Science . offers the data management community one of the biggest challenges in its forty-year history and opens up a new world of data management. Key to success in this new world will be collaboration with other disciplines whether at the technical level - partnering with the semantic technologies community to augment their reasoning capabilities with systems support - or at the problem solving level - partnering with real world domains as proposed by the new discipline of Web Science.|Michael L. Brodie","16505|IJCAI|2007|Market Based Resource Allocation with Incomplete Information|Although there are some research efforts toward resource allocation in multi-agent systems (MAS), most of these work assume that each agent has complete information about other agents. This research investigates interactions among selfish, rational, and autonomous agents in resource allocation, each with incomplete information about other entities, and each seeking to maximize its expected utility. This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","43906|IEICE Transations|2007|On Reachability Analysis of Multi Agent Nets|Petri nets are known as a modeling language for concurrent and distributed systems.

But a drawback is that it uniquely classifies each pattern to one class or none. This is not appropriate to be applied in classification problem involves overlapping patterns. In this paper, a novel multi-model classifier (DR-SVM) which combines SVM classifier with kNN algorithm under rough set technique is proposed. Instead of classifying the patterns directly, patterns lying in the overlapped region are extracted firstly. Then, upper and lower approximations of each class are defined on the basis of rough set technique. The classification operation is carried out on these new sets. Simulation results on synthetic data set and benchmark data sets indicate that, compared with conventional classifiers, more reasonable and accurate information about the pattern's category could be obtained by use of DR-SVM.|Yaohua Tang,Jinghuai Gao","44074|IEICE Transations|2007|Multi-Fractality Analysis of Time Series in Artificial Stock Market Generated by Multi-Agent Systems Based on the Genetic Programming and Its Applications|There are several methods for generating multi-fractal time series, but the origin of the multi-fractality is not discussed so far. This paper deals with the multi-fractality analysis of time series in an artificial stock market generated by multi-agent systems based on the Genetic Programming (GP) and its applications to feature extractions. Cognitive behaviors of agents are modeled by using the GP to introduce the co-evolutionary (social) learning as well as the individual learning. We assume five types of agents, in which a part of the agents prefer forecast equations or forecast rules to support their decision making, and another type of the agents select decisions at random like a speculator. The agents using forecast equations and rules usually use their own knowledge base, but some of them utilize their public (common) knowledge base to improve trading decisions. For checking the multi-fractality we use an extended method based on the continuous time wavelet transform. Then, it is shown that the time series of the artificial stock price reveals as a multi-fractal signal. We mainly focus on the proportion of the agents of each type. To examine the role of agents of each type, we classify six cases by changing the composition of agents of types. As a result, in several cases we find strict multi-fractality in artificial stock prices, and we see the relationship between the realizability (reproducibility) of multi-fractality and the system parameters. By applying a prediction method for mono-fractal time series as counterparts, features of the multi-fractal time series are extracted. As a result, we examine and find the origin of multi-fractal processes in artificial stock prices.|Yoshikazu Ikeda,Shozo Tokinaga"],["65537|AAAI|2005|Word Sense Disambiguation with Semi-Supervised Learning|Current word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning are still limited in that they do not work well for all words in a language.

This knowledge is represented using publicly available ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, such as the Open Directory these ontologies are further enriched by several orders of magnitude through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the documents alone. Experimental results confirm improved performance, breaking through the plateau previously reached in the field.|Evgeniy Gabrilovich,Shaul Markovitch","44120|IEICE Transations|2007|A Machine Learning Approach for an Indonesian-English Cross Language Question Answering System|We have built a CLQA (Cross Language Question Answering) system for a source language with limited data resources (e.g. Indonesian) using a machine learning approach. The CLQA system consists of four modules question analyzer, keyword translator, passage retriever and answer finder. We used machine learning in two modules, the question classifier (part of the question analyzer) and the answer finder. In the question classifier, we classify the EAT (Expected Answer Type) of a question by using SVM (Support Vector Machine) method. Features for the classification module are basically the output of our shallow question parsing module. To improve the classification score, we use statistical information extracted from our Indonesian corpus. In the answer finder module, using an approach different from the common approach in which answer is located by matching the named entity of the word corpus with the EAT of question, we locate the answer by text chunking the word corpus. The features for the SVM based text chunking process consist of question features, word corpus features and similarity scores between the word corpus and the question keyword. In this way, we eliminate the named entity tagging process for the target document. As for the keyword translator module, we use an Indonesian-English dictionary to translate Indonesian keywords into English. We also use some simple patterns to transform some borrowed English words. The keywords are then combined in boolean queries in order to retrieve relevant passages using IDF scores. We first conducted an experiment using , questions (about % are used as the test data) obtained from  Indonesian college students. We next conducted a similar experiment using the NTCIR (NII Test Collection for IR Systems)  CLQA task by translating the English questions into Indonesian. Compared to the Japanese-English and Chinese-English CLQA results in the NTCIR , we found that our system is superior to others except for one system that uses a high data resource employing  dictionaries. Further, a rough comparison with two other Indonesian-English CLQA systems revealed that our system achieved higher accuracy score.|Ayu Purwarianti,Masatoshi Tsuchiya,Seiichi Nakagawa","16136|IJCAI|2005|Learning Strategies for Open-Domain Natural Language Question Answering|We present an approach to automatically learning strategies for natural language question answering from examples composed of textual sources, questions, and answers.

In this paper, we propose a simple way to combat this problem without sacrificing channel estimation and frequency-offset tracking accuracy, by designing a sub-optimal configuration of the pilot tones. The effectiveness of the newly designed pilot tones in reducing PAPR is validated by Monte-Carlo simulations. The corresponding improvement in BER is also verified by simulations under IEEE .a standard settings, by using the channel with perfect CSI and the designed pilot-aided estimated channel for coherent detection.|Shinji Hosokawa,Kok Ann Donny Teo,Shuichi Ohno,Takao Hinamoto","44046|IEICE Transations|2007|Reduced-Complexity Detection for DPC-OFTDMA System Enhanced by Multi-Layer MIMO-OFDM in Wireless Multimedia Communications|During these years, we have been focusing on developing ultra high-data-rate wireless access systems for future wireless multimedia communications. One of such kind of systems is called DPC-OFTDMA (dynamic parameter controlled orthogonal frequency and time division multiple access) which targets at beyond  Mbps data rate. In order to support higher data rates, e.g., several hundreds of Mbps or even Gbps for future wireless multimedia applications (e.g., streaming video and file transfer), it is necessary to enhance DPC-OFTDMA system based on MIMO-OFDM (multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) platform. In this paper, we propose an enhanced DPC-OFTDMA system based on Multi-Layer MIMO-OFDM scheme which combines both diversity and multiplexing in order to exploit potentials of both techniques. The performance investigation shows the proposed scheme has better performance than its counterpart based on full-multiplexing MIMO-OFDM scheme. In addition to the Exhaustive Detection (EXD) scheme which applies the same detection algorithm on each subcarrier independently, we propose the Reduced-Complexity Detection (RCD) scheme. The complexity reduction is achieved by exploiting the suboptimal Layer Detection Order and subcarrier correlation. The simulation results show that huge complexity can be reduced with very small performance loss, by using the proposed detection scheme. For example, .% complexity can be cut off with only . dB performance loss for the    enhanced DPC-OFTDMA system.|Ming Lei,Hiroshi Harada","42624|IEICE Transations|2005|A Complexity-Efficient Wireless OFDM with Frequency Diversity and Low PAPR|This letter proposes a modified orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and reduced complexity.

The CLQA system consists of four modules question analyzer, keyword translator, passage retriever and answer finder. We used machine learning in two modules, the question classifier (part of the question analyzer) and the answer finder. In the question classifier, we classify the EAT (Expected Answer Type) of a question by using SVM (Support Vector Machine) method. Features for the classification module are basically the output of our shallow question parsing module. To improve the classification score, we use statistical information extracted from our Indonesian corpus. In the answer finder module, using an approach different from the common approach in which answer is located by matching the named entity of the word corpus with the EAT of question, we locate the answer by text chunking the word corpus. The features for the SVM based text chunking process consist of question features, word corpus features and similarity scores between the word corpus and the question keyword. In this way, we eliminate the named entity tagging process for the target document. As for the keyword translator module, we use an Indonesian-English dictionary to translate Indonesian keywords into English. We also use some simple patterns to transform some borrowed English words. The keywords are then combined in boolean queries in order to retrieve relevant passages using IDF scores. We first conducted an experiment using , questions (about % are used as the test data) obtained from  Indonesian college students.

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) using evolution strategies for its optimization problem frequently deliver better results with respect to the optimization criterion and the prediction accuracy. Moreover, evolutionary computation allows for the efficient large margin optimization of a huge family of new kernel functions, namely non-positive semi definite kernels as the Epanechnikov kernel. For these kernel functions, evolutionary SVM even outperform other learning methods like the Relevance Vector Machine. In this paper, we will discuss another major advantage of evolutionary SVM compared to traditional SVM solutions we can explicitly optimize the inherent trade-off between training error and model complexity by embedding multi-objective optimization into the evolutionary SVM. This leads to three advantages first, it is no longer necessary to tune the SVM parameter C which weighs both conflicting criteria. This is a very time-consuming task for traditional SVM. Second, the shape and size of the Pareto front give interesting insights about the complexity of the learning task at hand.

In mobile-agent-based systems, a larger number of agents generally require shorter time to complete the whole task but consume more resources (e.g., processing power and network bandwidth). Therefore, it is indispensable to keep an appropriate number of agents for the application on the mobile-agent-based system.

This paper proposes algorithms inspired by the single species population model, which is a well-known population ecology model.

Some systems apply the sole restriction of not allowing the introduction of previously considered arguments in an argumentation line.

We have shown recently that, for industrial-strength database engines, these diagrams are often remarkably complex and dense, with a large number of plans covering the space. However, they can often be reduced to much simpler pictures, featuring significantly fewer plans, without materially affecting the query processing quality. Plan reduction has useful implications for the design and usage of query optimizers, including quantifying redundancy in the plan search space, enhancing useability of parametric query optimization, identifying error-resistant and least-expected-cost plans, and minimizing the overheads of multi-plan approaches. We investigate here the plan reduction issue from theoretical, statistical and empirical perspectives. Our analysis shows that optimal plan reduction, w.r.t. minimizing the number of plans, is an NP-hard problem in general, and remains so even for a storage-constrained variant. We then present a greedy reduction algorithm with tight and optimal performance guarantees, whose complexity scales linearly with the number of plans in the diagram for a given resolution. Next, we devise fast estimators for locating the best tradeoff between the reduction in plan cardinality and the impact on query processing quality. Finally, extensive experimentation with a suite of multi-dimensional TPCH-based query templates on industrial-strength optimizers demonstrates that complex plan diagrams easily reduce to \"anorexic\" (small absolute number of plans) levels incurring only marginal increases in the estimated query processing costs.|Harish D.,Pooja N.

For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states.

These graphs may be enriched with weights, associated with the nodes and edges of the graph, denoting application specific desirabilitypenalty assessments, such as popularity, trust, or cost. A particular challenge when considering such weights in query processing is that results need to be ranked accordingly. Answering keyword-based queries on weighted graphs is shown to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we first show that answering queries with further structure imposed on them remains NP-hard. We next show that, while the query evaluation task can be viewed in terms of ranked structural-joins along query axes, the monotonicity property, necessary for ranked join algorithms, is violated. Consequently, traditional ranked join algorithms are not directly applicable. Thus, we establish an alternative, sum-max monotonicity property and show how to leverage this for developing a self-punctuating, horizon-based ranked join (HR-Join) operator for ranked twig-query execution on data graphs.

We tested this learned model in a second phase of this same study, and found that this model can effectively identify the information needs of new users as they browse previously unseen pages, and that we can use this information to help them find relevant pages.|Tingshao Zhu,Russell Greiner,Gerald Häubl,Kevin Jewell,Robert Price","57958|GECCO|2007|Dendritic cells for SYN scan detection|Artificial immune systems have previously been applied to the problem of intrusion detection.

However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by malicious users who may have an interest in promoting an item, or downplaying the popularity of another one. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, malicious shilling user profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system which can significantly affect the robustness of a recommender system. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of shilling profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. The aim of this work is to explore simpler unsupervised alternatives which exploit the nature of shilling profiles, and can be easily plugged into collaborative filtering framework to add robustness.

Knowing how much a user trusts a source can be very useful for aggregating, filtering, and ordering of information. Furthermore, if trust is used to support decision making, it is important to have an accurate estimate of trust when it is not directly available, as well as a measure of confidence in that estimate. This paper describes a new approach that gives an explicit probabilistic interpretation for confidence in social networks. We describe SUNNY, a new trust inference algorithm that uses a probabilistic sampling technique to estimate our confidence in the trust information from some designated sources. SUNNY computes an estimate of trust based on only those information sources with high confidence estimates. In our experiments, SUNNY produced more accurate trust estimates than the well known trust inference algorithm TIDALTRUST (Golbeck ), demonstrating its effectiveness.|Ugur Kuter,Jennifer Golbeck","80507|VLDB|2005|iMeMex Escapes from the Personal Information Jungle|Modern computer work stations provide thousands of applications that store data in  . files on the file system of the underlying OS.

To protect the exposure of information of user identification, the proposed protocol uses alias like a TID and a token instead of the identity of content users. Due to using alias, this protocol can guarantee the anonymity of content users. Also, it can prevent the leakage of individual information through encryption of usage information.

In these networks, the terrain must be covered by a set of base stations (or antennae), each of which defines a covered area called cell. The problem may be reduced to figure out the optimal placement of antennae out of a list of candidate sites trying to satisfy two objectives to maximize the area covered by the radio signal and to reduce the number of used antennae. Consequently, RND is a bi-objective optimization problem. Previous works have solved the problem by using single-objective techniques which combine the values of both objectives. The used techniques have allowed to find optimal solutions according to the defined objective, thus yielding a unique solution instead of the set of Pareto optimal solutions. In this paper, we solve the RND problem using a multi-objective version of the algorithm CHC, which is the metaheuristic having reported the best results when solving the single-objective formulation of RND. This new algorithm, called MOCHC, is compared against a binary-coded NSGA-II algorithm and also against the provided results in the literature.

Available GA-based dynamic RWA algorithms were designed mainly for WDM networks with a wavelength continuity constraint, and they cannot be applied directly to WDM networks with wavelength conversion capability. Furthermore, the available GA-based dynamic RWA algorithms suffer from the problem of requiring a very time consuming process to generate the first population of routes for a request, which may results in a significantly large delay in path setup. In this paper, we study the dynamic RWA problem in WDM networks with sparse wavelength conversion and propose a novel hybrid algorithm for it based on the combination of mobile agents technique and GA. By keeping a suitable number of mobile agents in the network to cooperatively explore the network states and continuously update the routing tables, the new hybrid algorithm can promptly determine the first population of routes for a new request based on the routing table of its source node, without requiring the time consuming process associated with current GA-based dynamic RWA algorithms. To achieve a good load balance in WDM networks with sparse wavelength conversion, we adopt in our hybrid algorithm a new reproduction scheme and a new fitness function that simultaneously takes into account the path length, number of free wavelengths, and wavelength conversion capability in route selection. Our new hybrid algorithm achieves a better load balance and results in a significantly lower blocking probability than does the Fixed-Alternate routing algorithm, both for optical networks with sparse and full-range wavelength converters and for optical networks with sparse and limited-range wavelength converters. This was verified by an extensive simulation study on the ns- network simulator and two typical network topologies. The ability to guarantee both a low blocking probability and a small setup delay makes the new hybrid dynamic RWA algorithm very attractive for current optical circuit switching networks and also for the next generation optical burst switching networks.|Vinh Trong Le,Xiaohong Jiang,Son-Hong Ngo,Susumu Horiguchi","66255|AAAI|2007|Extracting Influential Nodes for Information Diffusion on a Social Network|We consider the combinatorial optimization problem of finding the most influential nodes on a large-scale social network for two widely-used fundamental stochastic diffusion models.

This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","66222|AAAI|2007|Scaling Up Solving POMDPs through Value Based Clustering|Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide an appropriately rich model for agents operating under partial knowledge of the environment.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16267|IJCAI|2005|Conditional Planning in the Discrete Belief Space|Probabilistic planning with observability restrictions, as formalized for example as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), has a wide range of applications, but it is computationally extremely difficult.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs.

That is, a motion estimation and compensation technique of MPEG is applied between the reconstructed images from the assembled images with the disparities found during generation of assembled image and the original partial images. Therefore the compressed results are the disparity of each partial image to form the assembled image for the corresponding column, assembled image, and the motion vectors and the compensated image for each partial image. The experimental results with the implemented algorithm showed that the proposed method has NC (Normalized Correlation) values about % higher than the previous method at the same compression ratios, which convinced us that ours has better compression efficiency. Consequently, the proposed method is expected to be used effectively in the application areas to transmit or store in digital format the digital hologram data.|Young-Ho Seo,Hyun-Jun Choi,Jin-Woo Bae,Hoon-Jong Kang,Seung-Hyun Lee,Ji-Sang Yoo,Dong-Wook Kim","42455|IEICE Transations|2005|Construction of Sequences with Large Zero Correlation Zone|In order to judge the goodness of zero correlation zone sequence sets, a new concept, called ZCZ characteristic, is proposed.

In this paper, we revisit symmetric cancellation coding (SCC) proposed by Sathananthan et al. and compare the effectiveness of SCC with a fixed subtraction combining and the well-known polynomial cancellation coding (PCC) over Rayleigh fading channels with Doppler spread in terms of the signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) and bit-error-rate (BER). We also compare SCC with subtraction combining and SCC of Sathananthan et al. with maximum ratio combining (MRC). Our results show that SCC-OFDM with subtraction combining gives higher SINR than PCC-OFDM over the flat Rayleigh fading channel and that this superiority is not maintained under multi-path induced frequency-selective fading unless diversity combining is used. A simulation result shows, however, that SCC-OFDM with subtraction combining may perform better than PCC-OFDM for a certain range of Doppler spread when differential modulation is employed. Finally, we also demonstrate that the SCC-OFDM signal has less PAPR compared to the normal OFDM and PCC-OFDM and hence may be more practical.|Abdullah S.

One of such kind of systems is called DPC-OFTDMA (dynamic parameter controlled orthogonal frequency and time division multiple access) which targets at beyond  Mbps data rate. In order to support higher data rates, e.g., several hundreds of Mbps or even Gbps for future wireless multimedia applications (e.g., streaming video and file transfer), it is necessary to enhance DPC-OFTDMA system based on MIMO-OFDM (multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) platform.

The aim of this work is to develop robust speech recognition for adverse conditions that contain both stationary and non-stationary noise. In particular, we focus on the issue of impulsive noise, which is a major problem in practical speech recognition system. In this paper, two strategies were utilized to solve the problem. In the first strategy, adverse conditions are represented by an acoustic model. In this case, a large amount of training data and accurate acoustic models are required to present a variety of acoustic environments. This strategy is suitable for recognition in stationary or slow-varying noise conditions. The second is based on the idea that the corrupted frames are treated to reduce the adverse effect by compensation method. Since impulsive noise has a wide variety of features and its modeling is difficult, the second strategy is employed. In order to achieve those strategies, we propose two methods. Those methods are based on DMHMM framework which is one type of discrete HMM (DHMM). First, an estimation method of DMHMM parameters based on MAP is proposed aiming to improve trainability. The second is a method of compensating the observation probabilities of DMHMMs by threshold to reduce adverse effect of outlier values. Observation probabilities of impulsive noise tend to be much smaller than those of normal speech. The motivation in this approach is that flooring the observation probability reduces the adverse effect caused by impulsive noise. Experimental evaluations on Japanese LVCSR for read newspaper speech showed that the proposed method achieved the average error rate reduction of .% in impulsive noise conditions. Also the experimental results in adverse conditions that contain both stationary and impulsive noises showed that the proposed method achieved the average error rate reduction of .%.|Tetsuo Kosaka,Masaharu Katoh,Masaki Kohda","44257|IEICE Transations|2007|Average-Voice-Based Speech Synthesis Using HSMM-Based Speaker Adaptation and Adaptive Training|In speaker adaptation for speech synthesis, it is desirable to convert both voice characteristics and prosodic features such as F and phone duration. For simultaneous adaptation of spectrum, F and phone duration within the HMM framework, we need to transform not only the state output distributions corresponding to spectrum and F but also the duration distributions corresponding to phone duration. However, it is not straightforward to adapt the state duration because the original HMM does not have explicit duration distributions. Therefore, we utilize the framework of the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM), which is an HMM having explicit state duration distributions, and we apply an HSMM-based model adaptation algorithm to simultaneously transform both the state output and state duration distributions. Furthermore, we propose an HSMM-based adaptive training algorithm to simultaneously normalize the state output and state duration distributions of the average voice model. We incorporate these techniques into our HSMM-based speech synthesis system, and show their effectiveness from the results of subjective and objective evaluation tests.|Junichi Yamagishi,Takao Kobayashi","44196|IEICE Transations|2007|Fast Concatenative Speech Synthesis Using Pre-Fused Speech Units Based on the Plural Unit Selection and Fusion Method|We have previously developed a concatenative speech synthesizer based on the plural speech unit selection and fusion method that can synthesize stable and human-like speech. In this method, plural speech units for each speech segment are selected using a cost function and fused by averaging pitch-cycle waveforms. This method has a large computational cost, but some platforms require a speech synthesis system that can work within limited hardware resources. In this paper, we propose an offline unit fusion method that reduces the computational cost. In the proposed method, speech units are fused in advance to make a pre-fused speech unit database. At synthesis time, a speech unit for each segment is selected from the pre-fused speech unit database and the speech waveform is synthesized by applying prosodic modification and concatenation without the computationally expensive unit fusion process. We compared several algorithms for constructing the pre-fused speech unit database. From the subjective and objective evaluations, the effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by the results that the quality of synthetic speech of the offline unit fusion method with  MB database is close to that of the online unit fusion method with  MB JP database and is slightly lower to that of the  MB US database, while the computational time is reduced by %.

While in a non-speech segment, it approaches to an exponential distribution to reduce noise effectively. Furthermore, when the noise is super-Gaussian, we modify the width of Gaussian so that the Gaussian model with the modified width approximates the distribution of the super-Gaussian noise. This technique is effective in suppressing residual noise well.

Our method eliminates the asynchronous abort of already committed transactions even if replicas in all network partitions continue to process transactions when network partitioning occurs. A decentralized and asynchronous approach is needed because it is difficult to keep a number of loosely coupled systems in working order, and replica operations performed in a centralized and synchronous way can degrade the performance of transaction processing. We eliminate the transaction abort by fairly distributing the variation in numerical data to replicas according to their demands and updating the distributed variation using only asynchronously propagated update transactions without calculating the precise global state among reachable replicas. In addition, fairly assigning the variation of data to replicas equalizes the disadvantages of processing update transactions among replicas. Fairness control for assigning the data variation is performed by averaging the variation requested by the replicas. A simulation showed that our system can achieve extremely high performance for processing update transactions and fairness among replicas.|Takao Yamashita","44339|IEICE Transations|2007|Rate-Sensitive Load Shedding in Data Stream Systems|Traditional load shedding algorithms for data stream systems calculate current operator selectivity over several run periods and use them to determine where to shed load during the next run period.

The aim of solving such problems is to obtain solutions that in terms of objectives and feasibility are as good as possible and at the same time are least sensitive to the parameter variations. Such solutions are said to be robust optimum solutions. In order to investigate the trade-off between the performance and robustness of optimum solutions, we present a new Robust Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (RMOGA) that optimizes two objectives a fitness value and a robustness index. The fitness value serves as a measure of performance of design solutions with respect to multiple objectives and feasibility of the original optimization problem. The robustness index, which is based on a non-gradient based parameter sensitivity estimation approach, is a measure that quantitatively evaluates the robustness of design solutions. RMOGA does not require a presumed probability distribution of uncontrollable parameters and also does not utilize the gradient information of these parameters. Three distance metrics are used to obtain the robustness index and robust solutions. To illustrate its application, RMOGA is applied to two well-studied engineering design problems from the literature.|Mian Li,Shapour Azarm,Vikrant Aute","57972|GECCO|2007|Kernel based automatic clustering using modified particle swarm optimization algorithm|This paper introduces a method for clustering complex and linearly non-separable datasets, without any prior knowledge of the number of naturally occurring clusters. The proposed method is based on an improved variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. In addition, it employs a kernel-induced similarity measure instead of the conventional sum-of-squares distance. Use of the kernel function makes it possible to cluster data that is linearly non-separable in the original input space into homogeneous groups in a transformed high-dimensional feature space. Computer simulations have been undertaken with a test bench of five synthetic and three real life datasets, in order to compare the performance of the proposed method with a few state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

First of all, we review premature convergence, one of the challenges confronted with when applying GAs to real-world problems. Next, some of the methods now available to prevent premature convergence and their intrinsic defects are discussed. A qualitative analysis is then done on the cause of premature convergence that is the loss of building blocks hosted in less-fit individuals during the course of evolution. Thus, we propose a new improver - GAs with Reserve Selection (GARS), where a reserved area is set up to save potential building blocks and a selection mechanism based on individual uniqueness is employed to activate the potentials. Finally, case studies are done in a few standard problems well known in the literature, where the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GARS in suppressing premature convergence, and also an enhancement is found in global optimization capacity.|Yang Chen,Jinglu Hu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Songnian Yu","57309|GECCO|2005|Optimization of passenger car design for the mitigation of pedestrian head injury using a genetic algorithm|The problem of pedestrian injury is a significant one throughout the world.

In many cases, planners must compute a planning graph for each element of a set of states. The naive technique enumerates the graphs individually. This is equivalent to solving an all-pairs shortest path problem by iterating a single-source algorithm over each source. We introduce a structure, the state agnostic planning graph, that directly, solves the all-pairs problem for the relaxation introduced by planning graphs.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

This signal model is more similar to measurement signals than the flat spectrum model which is an ideal model. If more than three waves impinge on a receiver, we must determine the proper grouping of the elements of TOA vector and AOA vector. It is difficult to determine the grouping using only measurement signals because of many degradation factors.

The aim of this work is to develop robust speech recognition for adverse conditions that contain both stationary and non-stationary noise. In particular, we focus on the issue of impulsive noise, which is a major problem in practical speech recognition system. In this paper, two strategies were utilized to solve the problem. In the first strategy, adverse conditions are represented by an acoustic model. In this case, a large amount of training data and accurate acoustic models are required to present a variety of acoustic environments. This strategy is suitable for recognition in stationary or slow-varying noise conditions. The second is based on the idea that the corrupted frames are treated to reduce the adverse effect by compensation method. Since impulsive noise has a wide variety of features and its modeling is difficult, the second strategy is employed. In order to achieve those strategies, we propose two methods. Those methods are based on DMHMM framework which is one type of discrete HMM (DHMM). First, an estimation method of DMHMM parameters based on MAP is proposed aiming to improve trainability. The second is a method of compensating the observation probabilities of DMHMMs by threshold to reduce adverse effect of outlier values. Observation probabilities of impulsive noise tend to be much smaller than those of normal speech. The motivation in this approach is that flooring the observation probability reduces the adverse effect caused by impulsive noise.

Although the KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis) has proved to be an efficient technique for being applied to speech recognition, it has the disadvantage of requiring training data reduction, when its amount is excessively large. This data reduction is important to avoid computational unfeasibility andor an extremely high computational burden related to the feature representation step of the training and the test data evaluations. The standard approach to perform this data reduction is to randomly choose frames from the original data set, which does not necessarily provide a good statistical representation of the original data set. In order to solve this problem a likelihood related re-estimation procedure was applied to the KPCA framework, thus creating the SKPCA, which nevertheless is not realizable for large training databases. The proposed approach consists in clustering the training data and applying to these clusters a SKPCA like data reduction technique generating the reduced data clusters. These reduced data clusters are merged and reduced in a recursive procedure until just one cluster is obtained, making the SKPCA approach realizable for a large amount of training data. The experimental results show the efficiency of SKPCA technique with the proposed approach over the KPCA with the standard sparse solution using randomly chosen frames and the standard feature extraction techniques.|Amaro Lima,Heiga Zen,Yoshihiko Nankaku,Keiichi Tokuda,Tadashi Kitamura,Fernando Gil Resende","44038|IEICE Transations|2007|Speech Enhancement Based on MAP Estimation Using a Variable Speech Distribution|In this paper, a novel speech enhancement algorithm based on the MAP estimation is proposed.

Previously, we proposed a single-microphone dereverberation method, named \"Harmonicity based dEReverBeration (HERB).\" HERB estimates the inverse filter for an unknown room transfer function by utilizing an essential feature of speech, namely harmonic structure. In previous studies, improvements in speech intelligibility was shown solely with spectrograms, and improvements in ASR performance were simply confirmed by matched condition acoustic model.

As a result, we found that HERB is capable of improving the speech intelligibility to approximately that of clean speech. Second, since HERB alone could not improve the ASR performance sufficiently, we further analyzed the HERB mechanism with a view to achieving further improvements. Taking the analysis results into account, we proposed an appropriate ASR configuration and conducted experiments. Experimental results confirmed that, if HERB is used with an ASR adaptation scheme such as MLLR and a multicondition acoustic model, it is very effective for improving ASR performance even in unknown severely reverberant environments.|Keisuke Kinoshita,Tomohiro Nakatani,Masato Miyoshi","42363|IEICE Transations|2005|An Unsupervised Speaker Adaptation Method for Lecture-Style Spontaneous Speech Recognition Using Multiple Recognition Systems|This paper describes an accurate unsupervised speaker adaptation method for lecture style spontaneous speech recognition using multiple LVCSR systems.

This is a non-trivial task that requires managing different views of the system. Many problems concerning this issue originate in the presence of contradictory goals and tasks, inconsistencies, and unexpected behaviours. Such troublesome configurations should be detected and prevented during the development process in order to study alternative ways to cope with them. In this paper, we present methods and tools that support the management of contradictions during the analysis and design of MAS. Contradiction management in MAS has to consider both individual (i.e. agent) and social (i.e. organization) aspects, and their dynamics. Such issues have already been considered in social sciences, and more concretely in the Activity Theory, a social framework for the study of interactions in activity systems. Our approach applies knowledge from Activity Theory in MAS, especially its base of contradiction patterns. That requires a formalization of this social theory in order to be applicable in a software engineering context and its adaptation to agent-oriented methodologies. Then, it will be possible to check the occurrence of contradiction patterns in a MAS specification and provide solutions to those situations. This technique has been validated by implementing an assistant for the INGENIAS Development Kit and has been tested with several case studies. This paper shows part of one of these experiments for a web application.|Rubén Fuentes-Fernández,Jorge J.

However, the protection of user privacy becomes one of the most important issues in DRM systems as the number of people who suffer from accidents caused by the infringement of individual information dramatically increases. This paper suggests a license management protocol which is a more powerful protocol to protect individual information in DRM. To protect the exposure of information of user identification, the proposed protocol uses alias like a TID and a token instead of the identity of content users. Due to using alias, this protocol can guarantee the anonymity of content users. Also, it can prevent the leakage of individual information through encryption of usage information. In this way, it can protect the privacy of content users.|Bok-Nyong Park,Wonjun Lee,Jae-Won Kim","80474|VLDB|2005|NILE-PDT A Phenomenon Detection and Tracking Framework for Data Stream Management Systems|In this demo, we present Nile-PDT, a Phenomenon Detection and Tracking framework using the Nile data stream management system.

Although most of the efforts in developing QA systems are devoted to dealing with electronic text, we consider it is also necessary to develop systems for document images. In this paper, we propose a method of document image retrieval for such QA systems. Since the task is not to retrieve all relevant documents but to find the answer somewhere in documents, retrieval should be precision oriented. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a method of improving precision of document image retrieval by taking into account the co-occurrence of successive terms in a question. The indexing scheme is based on two-dimensional distributions of terms and the weight of co-occurrence is measured by calculating the density distributions of terms. The proposed method was tested by using  pages of documents about the major league baseball with  questions and found that it is superior to the baseline method proposed by the authors.|Koichi Kise,Shota Fukushima,Keinosuke Matsumoto","57441|GECCO|2005|Emergence of communication in competitive multi-agent systems a pareto multi-objective approach|In this paper we investigate the emergence of communication in competitive multi-agent systems.

The agents are controlled by a new kind of computational network based on a compartmentalised model of neurons.

Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents.

In our approach the LMS are implemented via learned probabilistic context-sensitive grammar (LPCSG).

Applying LMS implies that the probabilities of applying each of particular production rules in LPCGS during the mutation depend on the context. These probabilities are learned from the aggregated reward values obtained from the parsed syntax of the evolved best-of-generation Snakebots. Empirically obtained results verify that LMS contributes to the improvement of computational effort of both (i) the evolution of the fastest possible locomotion gaits for various fitness conditions and (ii) the adaptation of these locomotion gaits to challenging environment and degraded mechanical abilities of Snakebot.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","57362|GECCO|2005|Feature influence for evolutionary learning|This paper presents an approach that deals with the feature selection problem, and includes two main aspects first, the selection is done during the evolutionary learning process, i.e., it is a dynamic approach and second, the selection is local, i.e., the algorithm selects the best features from the best space region to learn at a given time of the exploration process. While the traditional feature selection is based on the attribute relevance, our approach is based on a new concept, called feature influence, which is aware of the dynamics and locality of the concept. The feature influence provides a measure of the attribute relevance at a certain instant of the evolutionary learning process, since it depends on each generation. Experimental results have been obtained by comparing an EA--based supervised learning algorithm to its modified version to include the concept approached.

Then, it aligns word associations by consulting a bilingual dictionary and calculates correlation between senses of a target polysemous word and its associated words, which can be regarded as clues for identifying the sense of the target word. To overcome the problem of disparity of topical coverage between corpora of the two languages as well as the problem of ambiguity in word-association alignment, an algorithm for iteratively calculating a sense-vs.-clue correlation matrix for each target word was devised. Word-sense disambiguation for each instance of the target word is done by selecting the sense that maximizes the score, i.e., a weighted sum of the correlations between each sense and clues appearing in the context of the instance. An experiment using Wall Street Journal and Nihon Keizai Shimbun corpora together with the EDR bilingual dictionary showed that the new method has promising performance namely, the Fmeasure of its sense selection was .% compared to a baseline of .%.

In previous work, these tactics were manually generated. We introduce AKADS it uses an evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate such tactics. Our experiments show that it improves dynamic scripting's performance on a real-time strategy (RTS) game. Therefore, we conclude that high-quality domain knowledge (i.e., tactics) can be automatically generated for strong adaptive AI opponents in RTS games.

Two useful heuristics are the hm heuristics, which generalize the reachability heuristic underlying the planning graph, and pattern database heuristics.

We introduce two refinements of these heuristics First, the additive hm heuristic which yields an admissible sum of hm heuristics using a partitioning of the set of actions. Second, the constrained PDB heuristic which uses constraints from the original problem to strengthen the lower bounds obtained from abstractions. The new heuristics depend on the way the actions or problem variables are partitioned. We advance methods for automatically deriving additive hm and PDB heuristics from STRIPS encodings.

In this paper we provide a technique for accomplishing this objective. Our technique can deal with a rich class of preferences, including so-called temporally extended preferences (TEPs). Unlike simple preferences which express desired properties of the final state achieved by a plan, TEPs can express desired properties of the entire sequence of states traversed by a plan, allowing the user to express a much richer set of preferences. Our technique involves converting a planning problem with TEPs into an equivalent planning problem containing only simple preferences. This conversion is accomplished by augmenting the inputed planning domain with a new set of predicates and actions for updating these predicates. We then provide a collection of new heuristics and a specialized search algorithm that can guide the planner towards preferred plans. Under some fairly general conditions our method is able to find a most preferred plan-i.e., an optimal plan. It can accomplish this without having to resort to admissible heuristics, which often perform poorly in practice. Nor does our technique require an assumption of restricted plan length or make-span. We have implemented our approach in the HPlan-P planning system and used it to compete in the th International Planning Competition, where it achieved distinguished performance in the Qualitative Preferences track.|Jorge A.

In some of these domains, it is possible to learn reactive policies from example plans that solve many problems. However, due to the inductive nature of these learning techniques, the policies are often faulty, and fail to achieve high success rates. In this work, we consider how to effectively integrate imperfect learned policies with imperfect heuristics in order to improve over each alone. We propose a simple approach that uses the policy to augment the states expanded during each search step. In particular, during each search node expansion, we add not only its neighbors, but all the nodes along the trajectory followed by the policy from the node until some horizon. Empirical results show that our proposed approach benefits both of the leveraged automated techniques, learning and heuristic search, outperforming the state-of-the-art in most benchmark planning domains.|Sung Wook Yoon,Alan Fern,Robert Givan","65578|AAAI|2005|Conformant Planning for Domains with Constraints-A New Approach|The paper presents a pair of new conformant planners, CPApc and CPAph, based on recent developments in theory of action and change. As an input the planners take a domain description D in action language AL which allows state constraints (non-stratified axioms), together with a set of CNF formulae describing the initial state, and a set of literals representing the goal. We propose two approximations of the transition diagram T defined by D. Both approximations are deterministic transition functions and can be computed efficiently. Moreover they are sound (and sometimes complete) with respect to T. In its search for a plan, an approximation based planner analyses paths of an approximation instead of that of T. CPApc and CPAph are forward, best first search planners based on this idea. We compare them with two state-of-the-art conformant planners, KACMBP and Conformant-FF (CFF), over benchmarks in the literature, and over two new domains. One has large number of state constraints and another has a high degree of incompleteness. Our planners perform reasonably well in benchmark domains and outperform KACMBP and CFF in the first domain while still working well with the second one. Our experimental result shows that having an integral part of a conformant planner to deal with state constraints directly can significantly improve its performance extending a similar claim for classical planners in (Thiebaux. Hoffmann, & Nebel ).|Tran Cao Son,Phan Huy Tu,Michael Gelfond,A.

Levesque","65979|AAAI|2007|Nonmyopic Informative Path Planning in Spatio-Temporal Models|In many sensing applications we must continuously gather information to provide a good estimate of the state of the environment at every point in time. A robot may tour an environment, gathering information every hour. In a wireless sensor network, these tours correspond to packets being transmitted. In these settings, we are often faced with resource restrictions, like energy constraints. The users issue queries with certain expectations on the answer quality. Thus, we must optimize the tours to ensure the satisfaction of the user constraints, while at the same time minimize the cost of the query plan. For a single timestep, this optimization problem is NP-hard, but recent approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees provide good solutions. In this paper, we present a new efficient algorithm, exploiting dynamic programming and submodularity of the information collected, that efficiently plans data collection tours for an entire (finite) horizon. Our algorithm can use any single step procedure as a black box, and, based on its properties, provides strong theoretical guarantees for the solution. We also provide an extensive empirical analysis demonstrating the benefits of nonmyopic planning in two real world sensing applications.|Alexandra Meliou,Andreas Krause,Carlos Guestrin,Joseph M. Hellerstein","16650|IJCAI|2007|When is Temporal Planning Really Temporal|While even STRIPS planners must search for plans of unbounded length, temporal planners must also cope with the fact that actions may start at any point in time. Most temporal planners cope with this challenge by restricting action start times to a small set of decision epochs, because this enables search to be carried out in state-space and leverages powerful state-based reachability heuristics, originally developed for classical planning. Indeed, decision-epoch planners won the International Planning Competition's Temporal Planning Track in ,  and . However, decision-epoch planners have a largely unrecognized weakness they are incomplete. In order to characterize the cause of incompleteness, we identify the notion of required concurrency, which separates expressive temporal action languages from simple ones. We show that decisionepoch planners are only complete for languages in the simpler class, and we prove that the simple class is 'equivalent' to STRIPS Surprisingly, no problems with required concurrency have been included in the planning competitions. We conclude by designing a complete state-space temporal planning algorithm, which we hope will be able to achieve high performance by leveraging the heuristics that power decision epoch planners.|William Cushing,Subbarao Kambhampati,Mausam,Daniel S.

We also propose a method of synthesis for testability (SfT) which takes the features of our test generation method into consideration to synthesize sequential circuits from given FSM descriptions. The SfT method guarantees that the test generator will be able to find a state distinguishing sequence. The proposed method extracts the state justification sequence from the FSM produced by the synthesizer to improve the performance of its test generation process. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve % fault efficiency in relatively short test generation time.|Masato Nakasato,Satoshi Ohtake,Kewal K.

In order to reduce test data volume (TDV), the approach utilizes three templates, i.e., all , all , and the previously applied test data, for generating the subsequent test data by flipping the inconsistent bits. The approach employs a small number of test channels I to supply a large number of internal scan chains I- such that it can achieve significant reduction in test application time (TAT). Furthermore, as a non-intrusive and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) independent solution, the approach is suitable for IP core testing because it requires neither redesign of the core under test (CUT) nor running any additional ATPG for the encoding procedure. In addition, the decoder has low hardware overhead, and its design is independent of the CUT and the given test set. Theoretical analysis and experimental results for ISCAS  benchmark circuits have proven the efficiency of the proposed approach.|Gang Zeng,Hideo Ito","42917|IEICE Transations|2005|Scan Design for Two-Pattern Test without Extra Latches|There are three well-known approaches to using scan design to apply two-pattern testing broadside testing (functional justification), skewed-load testing and enhanced scan testing. The broadside and skewed-load testing use the standard scan design, and thus the area overheads are not high. However fault coverage is low. The enhanced scan testing uses the enhanced scan design. The design uses extra latches, and allows scan-in any two-pattern testing. While this method achieves high fault coverage, it causes high area overhead because of extra latches. This paper presents a new scan design where two-pattern testing with high fault coverage can be performed with area overhead as low as the standard scan design. The proposed scan-FFs are based on master-slave FFs. The input of each scan-FF is connected to the output of the master latch and not the slave latch of the previous FF. Every scan-FF maintains the output value during scan-shift operations.|Kazuteru Namba,Hideo Ito","16701|IJCAI|2007|Fault-Model-Based Test Generation for Embedded Software|Testing embedded software systems on the control units of vehicles is a safety-relevant task, and developing the test suites for performing the tests on test benches is time-consuming.

However, hitherto, there has been no work on multi-objective branch coverage. In many scenarios a single-objective formulation is unrealistic testers will want to find test sets that meet several objectives simultaneously in order to maximize the value obtained from the inherently expensive process of running the test cases and examining the output they produce. This paper introduces multi-objective branch coverage.The paper presents results from a case study of the twin objectives of branch coverage and dynamic memory consumption for both real and synthetic programs. Several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are applied. The results show that multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are suitable for this problem, and illustrates the way in which a Pareto optimal search can yield insights into the trade-offs between the two simultaneous objectives.|Kiran Lakhotia,Mark Harman,Phil McMinn","42985|IEICE Transations|2005|Swiss Cheese Test Case Generation for Web Services Testing|Current Web services testing techniques are unable to assure the desired level of trustworthiness, which presents a barrier to WS applications in mission and business critical environments. This paper presents a framework that assures the trustworthiness of Web services. New assurance techniques are developed within the framework, including specification verification via completeness and consistency checking, test case generation, and automated Web services testing. Traditional test case generation methods only generate positive test cases that verify the functionality of software. The proposed Swiss Cheese test case generation method is designed to generate both positive and negative test cases that also reveal the vulnerability of Web services. This integrated development process is implemented in a case study. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. It also reveals that the Swiss Cheese negative testing detects even more faults than positive testing and thus significantly reduces the vulnerability of Web services.|Wei-Tek Tsai,Xiao Wei,Yinong Chen,Raymond A.

They are used in applications where high-speed is essential, such as in digital signal or graphics applications. We introduce the edge-valued binary decision diagram (EVBDD) as a means of reducing the delay and memory requirements in NFGs. We also introduce a recursive segmentation algorithm, which divides the domain of the function to be realized into segments, where the given function is realized as a polynomial. This design reduces the size of the multiplier needed and thus reduces delay. It is also shown that an adder can be replaced by a set of -input AND gates, further reducing delay. We compare our results to NFGs designed with multi-terminal BDDs (MTBDDs). We show that EVBDDs yield a design that has, on the average, only % of the memory and % of the delay of NFGs designed using MTBDDs.|Shinobu Nagayama,Tsutomu Sasao,Jon T.
