For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states. We also show its superior performance over the centralized schemes in terms of update, query, and total communication costs.|Arnab Bhattacharya,Anand Meka,Ambuj K.

However, what has largely been ignored is a way to efficiently deploy these existing methods in a realistic, distributed enterprise integration environment. The straightforward use of existing methods often requires that all data be shipped to a coordinator for cleaning, which is often unacceptable. We develop a set of randomized algorithms that allow efficient application of existing entity resolution methods to the answering of aggregate queries over data that have been distributed across multiple sites. Using our methods, it is possible to efficiently generate aggregate query results that account for duplicate and inconsistent values scattered across a federated system.|Fei Xu,Chris Jermaine","80741|VLDB|2007|Efficient Keyword Search over Virtual XML Views|Emerging applications such as personalized portals, enterprise search and web integration systems often require keyword search over semi-structured views.

We posit that data-integration systems need to handle uncertainty at three levels, and do so in a principled fashion. First, the semantic mappings between the data sources and the mediated schema may be approximate because there may be too many of them to be created and maintained or because in some domains (e.g., bioinformatics) it is not clear what the mappings should be. Second, queries to the system may be posed with keywords rather than in a structured form. Third, the data from the sources may be extracted using information extraction techniques and so may yield imprecise data. As a first step to building such a system, we introduce the concept of probabilistic schema mappings and analyze their formal foundations. We show that there are two possible semantics for such mappings by-table semantics assumes that there exists a correct mapping but we don't know what it is by-tuple semantics assumes that the correct mapping may depend on the particular tuple in the source data. We present the query complexity and algorithms for answering queries in the presence of approximate schema mappings, and we describe an algorithm for efficiently computing the top-k answers to queries in such a setting.|Xin Luna Dong,Alon Y.

However, this model is not suitable for processing concurrent distributed queries because the foundation, the memory-disk hierarchy, does not exist for data provided by remote sources. Therefore, the query engine cannot exploit any data sharing so that each process will have to interact with data sources independently issue data requests and fetch data over the network. This paper presents Request Window, a novel DQP mechanism that can detect and employ data sharing opportunities across concurrent distributed queries. By combining multiple similar data requests issued to the same data source to a common data request, Request Window allows concurrent query executing processes to share the common result data. With the benefits of reduced source burdens and data transfers, the throughput of query engine can be significantly improved. This paper also introduces the IGNITE system, an extended PostgreSQL with DQP support. Our experimental results show that Request Window makes IGNITE achieve a .x speedup over a commercial data integration system when running a workload of distributed TPC-H queries.|Rubao Lee,Minghong Zhou,Huaming Liao","80752|VLDB|2007|Update Exchange with Mappings and Provenance|We consider systems for data sharing among heterogeneous peers related by a network of schema mappings. Each peer has a locally controlled and edited database instance, but wants to ask queries over related data from other peers as well. To achieve this, every peer's updates propagate along the mappings to the other peers. However, this update exchange is filtered by trust conditions --- expressing what data and sources a peer judges to be authoritative --- which may cause a peer to reject another's updates. In order to support such filtering, updates carry provenance information. These systems target scientific data sharing applications, and their general principles and architecture have been described in . In this paper we present methods for realizing such systems. Specifically, we extend techniques from data integration, data exchange, and incremental view maintenance to propagate updates along mappings we integrate a novel model for tracking data provenance, such that curators may filter updates based on trust conditions over this provenance we discuss strategies for implementing our techniques in conjunction with an RDBMS and we experimentally demonstrate the viability of our techniques in the ORCHESTRA prototype system.|Todd J.

In sharp contrast to standard information integration architectures, a dataspace management system is a data-coexistence approach it does not require any investments in semantic integration before querying services on the data are provided. Rather, a dataspace can be gradually enhanced over time by defining relationships among the data. Defining those integration semantics gradually is termed pay-as-you-go information integration , as time and effort (pay) are needed over time (go) to provide integration semantics. The benefits are better query results (gain). This paper is the first to explore pay-as-you-go information integration in dataspaces. We provide a technique for declarative pay-as-you-go information integration named iTrails. The core idea of our approach is to declaratively add lightweight 'hints' (trails) to a search engine thus allowing gradual enrichment of loosely integrated data sources. Our experiments confirm that iTrails can be efficiently implemented introducing only little overhead during query execution. At the same time iTrails strongly improves the quality of query results. Furthermore, we present rewriting and pruning techniques that allow us to scale iTrails to tens of thousands of trail definitions with minimal growth in the rewritten query size.|Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles,Jens-Peter Dittrich,Shant Kirakos Karakashian,Olivier Ren√© Girard,Lukas Blunschi","80747|VLDB|2007|Model Management and Schema Mappings Theory and Practice|We present an overview of a tutorial on model management---an approach to solving data integration problems, such as data warehousing, e-commerce, object-to-relational mapping, schema evolution and enterprise information integration.

We propose a general class of queries, model-based optimization queries, in which a generic model is used to define a wide variety of queries involving an optimization objective function andor a set of constraints on the attributes. This model can be used to define optimization of linear and nonlinear expressions over object attributes as well as many existing query types studied in database research literature. A significant and important subset of this general model relevant to real-world applications include queries where the optimization function and constraints are convex. We cast such queries as members of the convex optimization (CP) model and provide a unified query processing framework for CP queries that IO optimally accesses data and space partitioning index structures without changing the underlying structures. We perform experiments to show the generality of the technique and where possible, compare to techniques developed for specialized optimization queries. We find that we achieve nearly identical performance to the limited optimization query types with optimal solutions, while providing generic modeling and processing for a much broader class of queries, and while effectively handling problem constraints.|Michael Gibas,Ning Zheng,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu"],["80861|VLDB|2007|Scalable Semantic Web Data Management Using Vertical Partitioning|Efficient management of RDF data is an important factor in realizing the Semantic Web vision.

Recently, with the increasing use of ontology in various applications, the quest has become more concrete and urgent. However, manipulating knowledge along with relational data in DBMSs is not a trivial undertaking. In this paper, we introduce a novel, unified framework for managing data and domain knowledge. We provide the user with a virtual view that unifies the data, the domain knowledge and the knowledge inferable from the data using the domain knowledge. Because the virtual view is in the relational format, users can query the data and the knowledge in a seamlessly integrated manner. To facilitate knowledge representation and inferencing within the database engine, our approach leverages XML support in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server & IBM DB  PureXML). We provide a query rewriting mechanism to bridge the difference between logical and physical data modeling, so that queries on the virtual view can be automatically transformed to components that execute on the hybrid relational-XML engine in a way that is transparent to the user.|Lipyeow Lim,Haixun Wang,Min Wang","80767|VLDB|2007|Materialized Views in Probabilistic Databases for Information Exchange and Query Optimization|Views over probabilistic data contain correlations between tuples, and the current approach is to capture these correlations using explicit lineage. In this paper we propose an alternative approach to materializing probabilistic views, by giving conditions under which a view can be represented by a block-independent disjoint (BID) table. Not all views can be represented as BID tables and so we propose a novel partial representation that can represent all views but may not define a unique probability distribution. We then give conditions on when a query's value on a partial representation will be uniquely defined. We apply our theory to two applications query processing using views and information exchange using views. In query processing on probabilistic data, we can ignore the lineage and use materialized views to more efficiently answer queries. By contrast, if the view has explicit lineage, the query evaluation must reprocess the lineage to compute the query resulting in dramatically slower execution. The second application is information exchange when we do not wish to disclose the entire lineage, which otherwise may result in shipping the entire database. The paper contains several theoretical results that completely solve the problem of deciding whether a conjunctive view can be represented as a BID and whether a query on a partial representation is uniquely determined. We validate our approach experimentally showing that representable views exist in real and synthetic workloads and show over three magnitudes of improvement in query processing versus a lineage based approach.|Christopher Re,Dan Suciu","80854|VLDB|2007|Sum-Max Monotonic Ranked Joins for Evaluating Top-K Twig Queries on Weighted Data Graphs|In many applications, the underlying data (the web, an XML document, or a relational database) can be seen as a graph. These graphs may be enriched with weights, associated with the nodes and edges of the graph, denoting application specific desirabilitypenalty assessments, such as popularity, trust, or cost. A particular challenge when considering such weights in query processing is that results need to be ranked accordingly. Answering keyword-based queries on weighted graphs is shown to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we first show that answering queries with further structure imposed on them remains NP-hard. We next show that, while the query evaluation task can be viewed in terms of ranked structural-joins along query axes, the monotonicity property, necessary for ranked join algorithms, is violated. Consequently, traditional ranked join algorithms are not directly applicable. Thus, we establish an alternative, sum-max monotonicity property and show how to leverage this for developing a self-punctuating, horizon-based ranked join (HR-Join) operator for ranked twig-query execution on data graphs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation schemes and the HR-join operator for merging ranked sub-results under sum-max monotonicity.|Yan Qi 0002,K.

Today, database systems typically maintain views eagerly in the same transaction as the base table updates. This has the effect that updates pay for view maintenance while beneficiaries (queries) get a free ride View maintenance overhead can be significant and it seems unfair to have updates bear the cost. We present a novel way to lazily maintain materialized views that relieves updates of this overhead. Maintenance of a view is postponed until the system has free cycles or the view is referenced by a query. View maintenance is fully or partly hidden from queries depending on the system load. Ideally, views are maintained entirely on system time at no cost to updates and queries. The efficiency of lazy maintenance is improved by combining updates from several transactions into a single maintenance operation, by condensing multiple updates of the same row into a single update, and by exploiting row versioning. Experiments using a prototype implementation in Microsoft SQL Server show much faster response times for updates and also significant reduction in maintenance cost when combining updates.|Jingren Zhou,Per-√\u2026ke Larson,Hicham G.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated.

Hence, multi-core processors that provide high aggregate processing capacity are ideal matches for executing costly DSMS operators. The recently developed Cell processor is a good example of a heterogeneous multi-core architecture and provides a powerful platform for executing data stream operators with high-performance. On the down side, exploiting the full potential of a multi-core processor like Cell is often challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous nature of the processing elements, the software managed local memory at the co-processor side, and the unconventional programming model in general. In this paper, we study the problem of scalable execution of windowed stream join operators on multi-core processors, and specifically on the Cell processor. By examining various aspects of join execution flow, we determine the right set of techniques to apply in order to minimize the sequential segments and maximize parallelism. Concretely, we show that basic windows coupled with low-overhead pointer-shifting techniques can be used to achieve efficient join window partitioning, column-oriented join window organization can be used to minimize scattered data transfers, delay-optimized double buffering can be used for effective pipelining, rate-aware batching can be used to balance join throughput and tuple delay, and finally SIMD (single-instruction multiple-data) optimized operator code can be used to exploit data parallelism. Our experimental results show that, following the design guidelines and implementation techniques outlined in this paper, windowed stream joins can achieve high scalability (linear in the number of co-processors) by making efficient use of the extensive hardware parallelism provided by the Cell processor (reaching data processing rates of &ap  GBsec) and significantly surpass the performance obtained form conventional high-end processors (supporting a combined input stream rate of  tuplessec using  minutes windows and without dropping any tuples, resulting in &ap . times higher output rate compared to an SSE implementation on dual .Ghz Intel Xeon).|Bugra Gedik,Philip S.

Recently, the problem of data provenance has been increasingly addressed in database research. Earlier work has been limited to the lineage of data as it is manipulated using relational operations within an RDBMS. While this captures a very important aspect of scientific data processing, the existing work is incapable of handling the equally important, and prevalent, cases where the data is processed by non-relational operations. This is particularly common in scientific data where sophisticated processing is achieved by programs that are not part of a DBMS. The problem of tracking lineage when non-relational operators are used to process the data is particularly challenging since there is potentially no constraint on the nature of the processing. In this paper we propose a novel technique that overcomes this significant barrier and enables the tracing of lineage of data generated by an arbitrary function. Our technique works directly with the executable code of the function and does not require any high-level description of the function or even the source code. We establish the feasibility of our approach on a typical application and demonstrate that the technique is able to discern the correct lineage. Furthermore, it is shown that the method can help identify limitations in the function itself.|Mingwu Zhang,Xiangyu Zhang,Xiang Zhang,Sunil Prabhakar","80803|VLDB|2007|Request Window an Approach to Improve Throughput of RDBMS-based Data Integration System by Utilizing Data Sharing Across Concurrent Distributed Queries|This paper focuses on the problem of improving distributed query throughput of the RDBMS-based data integration system that has to inherit the query execution model of the underlying RDBMS execute each query independently and utilize a global buffer pool mechanism to provide disk page sharing across concurrent query execution processes. However, this model is not suitable for processing concurrent distributed queries because the foundation, the memory-disk hierarchy, does not exist for data provided by remote sources. Therefore, the query engine cannot exploit any data sharing so that each process will have to interact with data sources independently issue data requests and fetch data over the network. This paper presents Request Window, a novel DQP mechanism that can detect and employ data sharing opportunities across concurrent distributed queries. By combining multiple similar data requests issued to the same data source to a common data request, Request Window allows concurrent query executing processes to share the common result data. With the benefits of reduced source burdens and data transfers, the throughput of query engine can be significantly improved. This paper also introduces the IGNITE system, an extended PostgreSQL with DQP support. Our experimental results show that Request Window makes IGNITE achieve a .x speedup over a commercial data integration system when running a workload of distributed TPC-H queries.|Rubao Lee,Minghong Zhou,Huaming Liao"],["80812|VLDB|2007|Extending Q-Grams to Estimate Selectivity of String Matching with Low Edit Distance|There are many emerging database applications that require accurate selectivity estimation of approximate string matching queries.

The demand for such applications, as the market grows, exceeds the capacity of individual businesses to provide fast and reliable services, making outsourcing technologies a key player in alleviating issues of scale. Consider a stock broker that needs to provide a real-time stock trading monitoring service to clients. Since the cost of multicasting this information to a large audience might become prohibitive, the broker could outsource the stock feed to third-party providers, who are in turn responsible for forwarding the appropriate sub-feed to clients. Evidently, in critical applications the integrity of the third-party should not be taken for granted. In this work we study a variety of authentication algorithms for selection and aggregation queries over sliding windows. Our algorithms enable the end-users to prove that the results provided by the third-party are correct, i.e., equal to the results that would have been computed by the original provider. Our solutions are based on Merkle hash trees over a forest of space partitioning data structures, and try to leverage key features, like update, query, signing, and authentication costs.

However, traditional information retrieval techniques are likely to be expensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized. Our performance evaluation using the INEX data set in the Quark  open-source XML database system indicates that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient.|Feng Shao,Lin Guo,Chavdar Botev,Anand Bhaskar,Muthiah Chettiar,Fan Yang 0002,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram","80856|VLDB|2007|DAMIA - A Data Mashup Fabric for Intranet Applications|Damia is a lightweight enterprise data integration service where line of business users can create and catalog high value data feeds for consumption by situational applications.

This is a problem of great significance for a variety of business intelligence applications. Implementations of record matching rely on exact as well as approximate string matching (e.g., edit distances) and use of external reference data sources. Record matching can be viewed as a query composed of a small set of primitive operators. However, formulating such record matching queries is difficult and depends on the specific application scenario. Specifically, the number of options both in terms of string matching operations as well as the choice of external sources can be daunting. In this paper, we exploit the availability of positive and negative examples to search through this space and suggest an initial record matching query. Such queries can be subsequently modified by the programmer as needed. We ensure that the record matching queries our approach produces are () efficient these queries can be run on large datasets by leveraging operations that are well-supported by RDBMSs, and () explainable the queries are easy to understand so that they may be modified by the programmer with relative ease.

For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states. We also show its superior performance over the centralized schemes in terms of update, query, and total communication costs.|Arnab Bhattacharya,Anand Meka,Ambuj K.

It is therefore of utmost importance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate schemas from sets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on the inference of Document Type Definitions (DTDs for short), we will consider the inference of XML Schema Definitions (XSDs for short) --- the increasingly popular schema formalism that is turning DTDs obsolete. In contrast to DTDs where the content model of an element depends only on the element's name, the content model in an XSD can also depend on the context in which the element is used. Hence, while the inference of DTDs basically reduces to the inference of regular expressions from sets of sample strings, the inference of XSDs also entails identifying from a corpus of sample documents the contexts in which elements bear different content models. Since a seminal result by Gold implies that no inference algorithm can learn the complete class of XSDs from positive examples only, we focus on a class of XSDs that captures most XSDs occurring in practice. For this class, we provide a theoretically complete algorithm that always infers the correct XSD when a sufficiently large corpus of XML documents is available. In addition, we present a variant of this algorithm that works well on real-world (and therefore incomplete) data sets.|Geert Jan Bex,Frank Neven,Stijn Vansummeren","80806|VLDB|2007|Monitoring Business Processes with Queries|Many enterprises nowadays use business processes, based on the BPEL standard, to achieve their goals.

With the increasing use of XML as the standard format on many Internet-based applications, XML aware pub-sub applications become necessary. In such systems, the messages (generated by publishers) are encoded as XML documents, and the profiles (defined by subscribers) as XML query statements. As the number of documents and query requests grow, the performance and scalability of the matching phase (i.e. matching of queries to incoming documents) become vital. Current solutions have limited or no flexibility to prune out queries in advance. In this paper, we overcome such limitation by proposing a novel early pruning approach called Bounding-based XML Filtering or BoXFilter. The BoXFilter is based on a new tree-like indexing structure that organizes the queries based on their similarity and provides lower and upper bound estimations needed to prune queries not related to the incoming documents.

Factors affecting road speed, such as weather, time of day, and vehicle type, need to be considered in order to select fast routes that match current driving conditions. Most existing systems compute fastest paths based on road Euclidean distance and a small set of predefined road speeds. However, \"History is often the best teacher\". Historical traffic data or driving patterns are often more useful than the simple Euclidean distance-based computation because people must have good reasons to choose these routes, e.g., they may want to avoid those that pass through high crime areas at night or that likely encounter accidents, road construction, or traffic jams. In this paper, we present an adaptive fastest path algorithm capable of efficiently accounting for important driving and speed patterns mined from a large set of traffic data. The algorithm is based on the following observations () The hierarchy of roads can be used to partition the road network into areas, and different path pre-computation strategies can be used at the area level, () we can limit our route search strategy to edges and path segments that are actually frequently traveled in the data, and () drivers usually traverse the road network through the largest roads available given the distance of the trip, except if there are small roads with a significant speed advantage over the large ones.

Each peer has a locally controlled and edited database instance, but wants to ask queries over related data from other peers as well. To achieve this, every peer's updates propagate along the mappings to the other peers. However, this update exchange is filtered by trust conditions --- expressing what data and sources a peer judges to be authoritative --- which may cause a peer to reject another's updates. In order to support such filtering, updates carry provenance information. These systems target scientific data sharing applications, and their general principles and architecture have been described in . In this paper we present methods for realizing such systems. Specifically, we extend techniques from data integration, data exchange, and incremental view maintenance to propagate updates along mappings we integrate a novel model for tracking data provenance, such that curators may filter updates based on trust conditions over this provenance we discuss strategies for implementing our techniques in conjunction with an RDBMS and we experimentally demonstrate the viability of our techniques in the ORCHESTRA prototype system.|Todd J.

Because the virtual view is in the relational format, users can query the data and the knowledge in a seamlessly integrated manner. To facilitate knowledge representation and inferencing within the database engine, our approach leverages XML support in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server & IBM DB  PureXML).

Recently, the problem of data provenance has been increasingly addressed in database research. Earlier work has been limited to the lineage of data as it is manipulated using relational operations within an RDBMS. While this captures a very important aspect of scientific data processing, the existing work is incapable of handling the equally important, and prevalent, cases where the data is processed by non-relational operations. This is particularly common in scientific data where sophisticated processing is achieved by programs that are not part of a DBMS. The problem of tracking lineage when non-relational operators are used to process the data is particularly challenging since there is potentially no constraint on the nature of the processing. In this paper we propose a novel technique that overcomes this significant barrier and enables the tracing of lineage of data generated by an arbitrary function. Our technique works directly with the executable code of the function and does not require any high-level description of the function or even the source code. We establish the feasibility of our approach on a typical application and demonstrate that the technique is able to discern the correct lineage. Furthermore, it is shown that the method can help identify limitations in the function itself.|Mingwu Zhang,Xiangyu Zhang,Xiang Zhang,Sunil Prabhakar","80802|VLDB|2007|Eliminating Impedance Mismatch in C|Recently, the C and the VISUAL BASIC communities were tantalized by the advent of LINQ ---the Language INtegrated Query technology from Microsoft.

This is particularly relevant for outsourced data frameworks in which clients place data management with specialized service providers. Clients are reluctant to place sensitive data under the control of a foreign party without assurances of confidentiality. Additionally, once outsourced, privacy and data access correctness (data integrity and query completeness) become paramount. Today's solutions are fundamentally insecure and vulnerable to illicit behavior, because they do not handle these dimensions. In this tutorial we will explore how to design and build robust, efficient, and scalable data outsourcing mechanisms providing strong security assurances of () correctness, () confidentiality, and () data access privacy. There exists a strong relationship between such assurances for example, the lack of access pattern privacy usually allows for statistical attacks compromising data confidentiality. Confidentiality can be achieved by data encryption. However, to be practical, outsourced data services should allow expressive client queries (e.g., relational joins with arbitrary predicates) without compromising confidentiality. This is a hard problem because decryption keys cannot be directly provided to potentially untrusted servers. Moreover, if the remote server cannot be fully trusted, protocol correctness become essential. Therefore, solutions that do not address all three dimensions are incomplete and insecure.|Radu Sion"],["80730|VLDB|2007|Probabilistic Graphical Models and their Role in Databases|Probabilistic graphical models provide a framework for compact representation and efficient reasoning about the joint probability distribution of several interdependent variables.

In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

In such systems, the messages (generated by publishers) are encoded as XML documents, and the profiles (defined by subscribers) as XML query statements. As the number of documents and query requests grow, the performance and scalability of the matching phase (i.e. matching of queries to incoming documents) become vital. Current solutions have limited or no flexibility to prune out queries in advance. In this paper, we overcome such limitation by proposing a novel early pruning approach called Bounding-based XML Filtering or BoXFilter. The BoXFilter is based on a new tree-like indexing structure that organizes the queries based on their similarity and provides lower and upper bound estimations needed to prune queries not related to the incoming documents. Our experimental evaluation shows that the early profile pruning approach offers drastic performance improvements over the current state-of-the-art in XML filtering.|Mirella Moura Moro,Petko Bakalov,Vassilis J.

In this paper we examine aggregation in a multi-core environment, the Sun UltraSPARC T, a chip multiprocessor with eight cores and a shared L cache. Aggregation is an important aspect of query processing that is seemingly easy to understand and implement. Our research, however, demonstrates that a chip multiprocessor adds new dimensions to understanding hash-based aggregation performance---concurrent sharing of aggregation data structures and contentious accesses to frequently used values. We also identify a trade off between private data structures assigned to each thread versus shared data structures for aggregation. Depending on input characteristics, different aggregation strategies are optimal and choosing the wrong strategy can result in a performance penalty of over an order of magnitude. We provide a thorough explanation of the factors affecting aggregation performance on chip multiprocessors and identify three key input characteristics that dictate performance () average run length of identical group-by values, () locality of references to the aggregation hash table, and () frequency of repeated accesses to the same hash table location. We then introduce an adaptive aggregation operator that performs lightweight sampling of the input to choose the correct aggregation strategy with high accuracy.

This model can be used to define optimization of linear and nonlinear expressions over object attributes as well as many existing query types studied in database research literature. A significant and important subset of this general model relevant to real-world applications include queries where the optimization function and constraints are convex. We cast such queries as members of the convex optimization (CP) model and provide a unified query processing framework for CP queries that IO optimally accesses data and space partitioning index structures without changing the underlying structures. We perform experiments to show the generality of the technique and where possible, compare to techniques developed for specialized optimization queries. We find that we achieve nearly identical performance to the limited optimization query types with optimal solutions, while providing generic modeling and processing for a much broader class of queries, and while effectively handling problem constraints.|Michael Gibas,Ning Zheng,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu","80769|VLDB|2007|Structured Materialized Views for XML Queries|The performance of XML database queries can be greatly enhanced by rewriting them using materialized views.

It is therefore of utmost importance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate schemas from sets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on the inference of Document Type Definitions (DTDs for short), we will consider the inference of XML Schema Definitions (XSDs for short) --- the increasingly popular schema formalism that is turning DTDs obsolete. In contrast to DTDs where the content model of an element depends only on the element's name, the content model in an XSD can also depend on the context in which the element is used. Hence, while the inference of DTDs basically reduces to the inference of regular expressions from sets of sample strings, the inference of XSDs also entails identifying from a corpus of sample documents the contexts in which elements bear different content models. Since a seminal result by Gold implies that no inference algorithm can learn the complete class of XSDs from positive examples only, we focus on a class of XSDs that captures most XSDs occurring in practice. For this class, we provide a theoretically complete algorithm that always infers the correct XSD when a sufficiently large corpus of XML documents is available. In addition, we present a variant of this algorithm that works well on real-world (and therefore incomplete) data sets.|Geert Jan Bex,Frank Neven,Stijn Vansummeren","80861|VLDB|2007|Scalable Semantic Web Data Management Using Vertical Partitioning|Efficient management of RDF data is an important factor in realizing the Semantic Web vision. Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables.\" We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than  million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.|Daniel J.

We posit that data-integration systems need to handle uncertainty at three levels, and do so in a principled fashion. First, the semantic mappings between the data sources and the mediated schema may be approximate because there may be too many of them to be created and maintained or because in some domains (e.g., bioinformatics) it is not clear what the mappings should be. Second, queries to the system may be posed with keywords rather than in a structured form. Third, the data from the sources may be extracted using information extraction techniques and so may yield imprecise data. As a first step to building such a system, we introduce the concept of probabilistic schema mappings and analyze their formal foundations. We show that there are two possible semantics for such mappings by-table semantics assumes that there exists a correct mapping but we don't know what it is by-tuple semantics assumes that the correct mapping may depend on the particular tuple in the source data. We present the query complexity and algorithms for answering queries in the presence of approximate schema mappings, and we describe an algorithm for efficiently computing the top-k answers to queries in such a setting.|Xin Luna Dong,Alon Y.

Alternative query models have been proposed to give users the ability to query the database without schema knowledge. Those models, including simple keyword search and labeled keyword search, aim to extract meaningful data fragments that match the structure-free query conditions (e.g., keywords) based on various matching semantics. Typically, the matching semantics are content-based they are defined on data node inter-relationships and incur significant query evaluation cost. Our first contribution is a novel matching semantics based on analyzing the database schema. We show that query models employing a schema-based matching semantics can reduce query evaluation cost significantly while maintaining or even improving result quality. The adoption of schema-based matching semantics does not change the nature of those query models they are still schema-ignorant, i.e., users express no schema knowledge (except the labels in labeled keyword search) in the query. While those models work well for some queries on some databases, they often encounter problems when applied to complex queries on databases with complex schemas. Our second contribution is a novel query model that incorporates partial schema knowledge through the use of schema summary. This new summary-aware query model, called Meaningful Summary Query (MSQ), seamlessly integrates summary-based structural conditions and structure-free conditions, and enables ordinary users to query complex databases. We design algorithms for evaluating MSQ queries, and demonstrate that MSQ queries can produce better results against complex databases when compared with previous approaches, and that they can be efficiently evaluated.|Cong Yu,H.

Built following the principle of data independence, it separates a logical layer -- where data, schemas and mappings are managed -- from a physical layer consisting of a structured Peer-to-Peer network supporting efficient routing of messages and index load-balancing. Our system is totally decentralized, yet it fosters semantic interoperability through pairwise schema mappings and query reformulation. In this demonstration, we present a set of algorithms to automatically organize the network of schema mappings. We concentrate on three key functionalities () the sharing of data, schemas and schema mappings in the network, () the dynamic creation and deprecation of mappings to foster global interoperability, and () the propagation of queries using the mappings. We illustrate these functionalities using bioinformatic schemas and data in a network running on several hundreds of peers simultaneously.|Philippe Cudr√©-Mauroux,Suchit Agarwal,Adriana Budura,Parisa Haghani,Karl Aberer","80747|VLDB|2007|Model Management and Schema Mappings Theory and Practice|We present an overview of a tutorial on model management---an approach to solving data integration problems, such as data warehousing, e-commerce, object-to-relational mapping, schema evolution and enterprise information integration.

We show that CINDs are useful not only in data cleaning, but are also in contextual schema matching . To make effective use of CINDs in practice, it is often necessary to reason about them. The most important static analysis issue concerns consistency, to determine whether or not a given set of CINDs has conflicts. Another issue concerns implication, i.e., deciding whether a set of CINDs entails another CIND. We give a full treatment of the static analyses of CINDs, and show that CINDs retain most nice properties of traditional INDs (a) CINDs are always consistent (b) CINDs are finitely axiomatizable, i.e., there exists a sound and complete inference system for implication of CINDs and (c) the implication problem for CINDs has the same complexity as its traditional counterpart, namely, PSPACE-complete, in the absence of attributes with a finite domain but it is EXPTIME-complete in the general setting. In addition, we investigate the interaction between CINDs and conditional functional dependencies (CFDs), an extension of functional dependencies proposed in . We show that the consistency problem for the combination of CINDs and CFDs becomes undecidable. In light of the undecidability, we provide heuristic algorithms for the consistency analysis of CFDs and CINDs, and experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.|Loreto Bravo,Wenfei Fan,Shuai Ma"],["80830|VLDB|2007|GhostDB Hiding Data from Prying Eyes|Imagine that you have been entrusted with private data, such as corporate product information, sensitive government information, or symptom and treatment information about hospital patients. You may want to issue queries whose result will combine private and public data, but private data must not be revealed, say, to the prying eyes of some insurance fraudster. GhostDB is an architecture and system to achieve this. You carry private data in a smart USB device (a large Flash persistent store combined with a tamper and snoop-resistant CPU and small RAM). When the key is plugged in, you can issue queries that link private and public data and be sure that the only information revealed to a potential spy is which queries you pose and the public data you access. Queries linking public and private data entail novel distributed processing techniques on extremely unequal devices (standard computer and smart USB device) in which data flows in only one direction from public to private. This demonstration shows GhostDB's query processing in action.|Christophe Salperwyck,Nicolas Anciaux,Mehdi Benzine,Luc Bouganim,Philippe Pucheral,Dennis Shasha","80784|VLDB|2007|Peer-to-Peer Similarity Search in Metric Spaces|This paper addresses the efficient processing of similarity queries in metric spaces, where data is horizontally distributed across a PP network. The proposed approach does not rely on arbitrary data movement, hence each peer joining the network autonomously stores its own data. We present SIMPEER, a novel framework that dynamically clusters peer data, in order to build distributed routing information at super-peer level. SIMPEER allows the evaluation of range and nearest neighbor queries in a distributed manner that reduces communication cost, network latency, bandwidth consumption and computational overhead at each individual peer. SIMPEER utilizes a set of distributed statistics and guarantees that all similar objects to the query are retrieved, without necessarily flooding the network during query processing. The statistics are employed for estimating an adequate query radius for k-nearest neighbor queries, and transform the query to a range query. Our experimental evaluation employs both real-world and synthetic data collections, and our results show that SIMPEER performs efficiently, even in the case of high degree of distribution.|Christos Doulkeridis,Akrivi Vlachou,Yannis Kotidis,Michalis Vazirgiannis","80791|VLDB|2007|Randomized Algorithms for Data Reconciliation in Wide Area Aggregate Query Processing|Many aspects of the data integration problem have been considered in the literature how to match schemas across different data sources, how to decide when different records refer to the same entity, how to efficiently perform the required entity resolution in a batch fashion, and so on.

In this scenario, a data owner (DO) constantly transmits its data to a service provider (SP), together with additional authentication information. Clients register continuous range queries to the SP. Whenever the data change, the SP must update the results of all affected queries and inform the clients accordingly. The clients can verify the correctness of the results using the authentication information provided by the DO. Compared to conventional databases, stream environments pose new challenges such as the need for fast structure updating, support for continuous query processing and authentication, and provision for temporal completeness. Specifically, in addition to the correctness of individual results, the client must be able to verify that there are no missing results in between updates. We face these challenges through several contributions. Since there is no previous work, we first present a technique, called REF, that achieves correctness and temporal completeness but incurs false transmissions, i.e., the SP has to inform clients whenever there is a data update, even if their results are not affected. Then, we propose CADS, which minimizes the processing and transmission overhead through an elaborate indexing scheme and a virtual caching mechanism. Finally, we extend CADS to the case where multiple owners outsource their data to the same SP. The SP integrates all data in a single authentication process, independently of the number of DOs.|Stavros Papadopoulos,Yin Yang,Dimitris Papadias","80783|VLDB|2007|Executing Stream Joins on the Cell Processor|Low-latency and high-throughput processing are key requirements of data stream management systems (DSMSs). Hence, multi-core processors that provide high aggregate processing capacity are ideal matches for executing costly DSMS operators. The recently developed Cell processor is a good example of a heterogeneous multi-core architecture and provides a powerful platform for executing data stream operators with high-performance. On the down side, exploiting the full potential of a multi-core processor like Cell is often challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous nature of the processing elements, the software managed local memory at the co-processor side, and the unconventional programming model in general. In this paper, we study the problem of scalable execution of windowed stream join operators on multi-core processors, and specifically on the Cell processor. By examining various aspects of join execution flow, we determine the right set of techniques to apply in order to minimize the sequential segments and maximize parallelism. Concretely, we show that basic windows coupled with low-overhead pointer-shifting techniques can be used to achieve efficient join window partitioning, column-oriented join window organization can be used to minimize scattered data transfers, delay-optimized double buffering can be used for effective pipelining, rate-aware batching can be used to balance join throughput and tuple delay, and finally SIMD (single-instruction multiple-data) optimized operator code can be used to exploit data parallelism. Our experimental results show that, following the design guidelines and implementation techniques outlined in this paper, windowed stream joins can achieve high scalability (linear in the number of co-processors) by making efficient use of the extensive hardware parallelism provided by the Cell processor (reaching data processing rates of &ap  GBsec) and significantly surpass the performance obtained form conventional high-end processors (supporting a combined input stream rate of  tuplessec using  minutes windows and without dropping any tuples, resulting in &ap . times higher output rate compared to an SSE implementation on dual .Ghz Intel Xeon).|Bugra Gedik,Philip S.

When one or more of these servers become overloaded due to bursty data arrival, excessive load needs to be shed in order to preserve low latency for the query results. Because of the load dependencies among the servers, load shedding decisions on these servers must be well-coordinated to achieve end-to-end control on the output quality. In this paper, we model the distributed load shedding problem as a linear optimization problem, for which we propose two alternative solution approaches a solver-based centralized approach, and a distributed approach based on metadata aggregation and propagation, whose centralized implementation is also available. Both of our solutions are based on generating a series of load shedding plans in advance, to be used under certain input load conditions.

However, this model is not suitable for processing concurrent distributed queries because the foundation, the memory-disk hierarchy, does not exist for data provided by remote sources. Therefore, the query engine cannot exploit any data sharing so that each process will have to interact with data sources independently issue data requests and fetch data over the network. This paper presents Request Window, a novel DQP mechanism that can detect and employ data sharing opportunities across concurrent distributed queries. By combining multiple similar data requests issued to the same data source to a common data request, Request Window allows concurrent query executing processes to share the common result data. With the benefits of reduced source burdens and data transfers, the throughput of query engine can be significantly improved. This paper also introduces the IGNITE system, an extended PostgreSQL with DQP support.

We propose a general class of queries, model-based optimization queries, in which a generic model is used to define a wide variety of queries involving an optimization objective function andor a set of constraints on the attributes. This model can be used to define optimization of linear and nonlinear expressions over object attributes as well as many existing query types studied in database research literature. A significant and important subset of this general model relevant to real-world applications include queries where the optimization function and constraints are convex. We cast such queries as members of the convex optimization (CP) model and provide a unified query processing framework for CP queries that IO optimally accesses data and space partitioning index structures without changing the underlying structures. We perform experiments to show the generality of the technique and where possible, compare to techniques developed for specialized optimization queries. We find that we achieve nearly identical performance to the limited optimization query types with optimal solutions, while providing generic modeling and processing for a much broader class of queries, and while effectively handling problem constraints.|Michael Gibas,Ning Zheng,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu"],["80730|VLDB|2007|Probabilistic Graphical Models and their Role in Databases|Probabilistic graphical models provide a framework for compact representation and efficient reasoning about the joint probability distribution of several interdependent variables.

Furthermore, we present a multi-stage control strategy for the optimization process. We illustrate the benefits and opportunities of our approach through a prototype implementation.

In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results.

This is particularly relevant for outsourced data frameworks in which clients place data management with specialized service providers. Clients are reluctant to place sensitive data under the control of a foreign party without assurances of confidentiality. Additionally, once outsourced, privacy and data access correctness (data integrity and query completeness) become paramount. Today's solutions are fundamentally insecure and vulnerable to illicit behavior, because they do not handle these dimensions. In this tutorial we will explore how to design and build robust, efficient, and scalable data outsourcing mechanisms providing strong security assurances of () correctness, () confidentiality, and () data access privacy. There exists a strong relationship between such assurances for example, the lack of access pattern privacy usually allows for statistical attacks compromising data confidentiality. Confidentiality can be achieved by data encryption. However, to be practical, outsourced data services should allow expressive client queries (e.g., relational joins with arbitrary predicates) without compromising confidentiality.

However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) of the time series, the similarity search over directly indexed time series usually encounters a serious problem, known as the \"dimensionality curse\". Thus, many dimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing the dimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods, only Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries, which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initial studies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods, however, show that PLA performs no worse than others. Motivated by this, in this paper, we re-investigate PLA for approximating and indexing time series. Specifically, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced PLA-space, and prove that this function indeed results in a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original time series, which can lead to no false dismissals during the similarity search. As a second step, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds to improve the search efficiency. Our extensive experiments over a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data sets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of PLA together with the newly proposed lower bound distance, in terms of both pruning power and wall clock time, compared with two state-of-the-art reduction methods, Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA) and Chebyshev Polynomials (CP).|Qiuxia Chen,Lei Chen 0002,Xiang Lian,Yunhao Liu,Jeffrey Xu Yu","80775|VLDB|2007|MIST Distributed Indexing and Querying in Sensor Networks using Statistical Models|The modeling of high level semantic events from low level sensor signals is important in order to understand distributed phenomena. For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states. We also show its superior performance over the centralized schemes in terms of update, query, and total communication costs.|Arnab Bhattacharya,Anand Meka,Ambuj K.

Recently, locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its variations have been proposed as indexing techniques for approximate similarity search. A significant drawback of these approaches is the requirement for a large number of hash tables in order to achieve good search quality. This paper proposes a new indexing scheme called multi-probe LSH that overcomes this drawback. Multi-probe LSH is built on the well-known LSH technique, but it intelligently probes multiple buckets that are likely to contain query results in a hash table. Our method is inspired by and improves upon recent theoretical work on entropy-based LSH designed to reduce the space requirement of the basic LSH method. We have implemented the multi-probe LSH method and evaluated the implementation with two different high-dimensional datasets. Our evaluation shows that the multi-probe LSH method substantially improves upon previously proposed methods in both space and time efficiency. To achieve the same search quality, multi-probe LSH has a similar time-efficiency as the basic LSH method while reducing the number of hash tables by an order of magnitude. In comparison with the entropy-based LSH method, to achieve the same search quality, multi-probe LSH uses less query time and  to  times fewer number of hash tables.|Qin Lv,William Josephson,Zhe Wang,Moses Charikar,Kai Li","80794|VLDB|2007|Fast nGram-Based String Search Over Data Encoded Using Algebraic Signatures|We propose a novel string search algorithm for data stored once and read many times. Our search method combines the sublinear traversal of the record (as in Boyer Moore or Knuth-Morris-Pratt) with the agglomeration of parts of the record and search pattern into a single character -- the algebraic signature -- in the manner of Karp-Rabin. Our experiments show that our algorithm is up to seventy times faster for DNA data, up to eleven times faster for ASCII, and up to a six times faster for XML documents compared with an implementation of Boyer-Moore. To obtain this speed-up, we store records in encoded form, where each original character is replaced with an algebraic signature. Our method applies to records stored in databases in general and to distributed implementations of a Database As Service (DAS) in particular. Clients send records for insertion and search patterns already in encoded form and servers never operate on records in clear text. No one at a node can involuntarily discover the content of the stored data.|Witold Litwin,Riad Mokadem,Philippe Rigaux,Thomas J. E.

However, traditional information retrieval techniques are likely to be expensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized. Our performance evaluation using the INEX data set in the Quark  open-source XML database system indicates that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient.|Feng Shao,Lin Guo,Chavdar Botev,Anand Bhaskar,Muthiah Chettiar,Fan Yang 0002,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram","80774|VLDB|2007|Towards Graph Containment Search and Indexing|Given a set of model graphs D and a query graph q, containment search aims to find all model graphs g &epsilon D such that q contains g (q &supe g). Due to the wide adoption of graph models, fast containment search of graph data finds many applications in various domains. In comparison to traditional graph search that retrieves all the graphs containing q (q &sube g), containment search has its own indexing characteristics that have not yet been examined. In this paper, we perform a systematic study on these characteristics and propose a contrast subgraph-based indexing model, called cIndex. Contrast subgraphs capture the structure differences between model graphs and query graphs, and are thus perfect for indexing due to their high selectivity. Using a redundancy-aware feature selection process, cIndex can sort out a set of significant and distinctive contrast subgraphs and maximize its indexing capability. We show that it is NP-complete to choose the best set of indexing features, and our greedy algorithm can approximate the one-level optimal index within a ratio of -- e. Taking this solution as a base indexing model, we further extend it to accommodate hierarchical indexing methodologies and apply data space clustering and sampling techniques to reduce the index construction time. The proposed methodology provides a general solution to containment search and indexing, not only for graphs, but also for any data with transitive relations as well. Experimental results on real test data show that cIndex achieves near-optimal pruning power on various containment search workloads, and confirms its obvious advantage over indices built for traditional graph search in this new scenario.|Chen Chen,Xifeng Yan,Philip S.

Our approach relies on representing both the queries and the data using a sequential encoding and then subsequently employing an innovative variant of the longest common subsequence (LCS) matching algorithm to retrieve the desired results. A key innovation here is the use of a series of inter-linked early pruning steps, coupled with a simple index structure that enable us to reduce the search space and eliminate a large number of false positive matches prior to applying the more expensive LCS matching algorithm. Additionally, we also present mechanisms that enable the user to specify constraints on the retrieved output and show how such constraints can be pushed deep into the retrieval process, leading to improved response times. Mechanisms supporting the retrieval of approximate matches are also supported. When compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the query processing time of our algorithms is shown to be up to two to three orders of magnitude faster on several real datasets on realistic query workloads. Finally, we show that our approach is suitable for emerging multi-core server architectures when retrieving data for more expensive queries.|Shirish Tatikonda,Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Matthew Goyder","80798|VLDB|2007|Modeling and Querying Vague Spatial Objects Using Shapelets|Research in modeling and querying spatial data has primarily focused on traditional \"crisp\" spatial objects with exact location and spatial extent.

However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams.

Furthermore, we present a multi-stage control strategy for the optimization process. We illustrate the benefits and opportunities of our approach through a prototype implementation.

Record matching can be viewed as a query composed of a small set of primitive operators. However, formulating such record matching queries is difficult and depends on the specific application scenario. Specifically, the number of options both in terms of string matching operations as well as the choice of external sources can be daunting.

However, this model is not suitable for processing concurrent distributed queries because the foundation, the memory-disk hierarchy, does not exist for data provided by remote sources. Therefore, the query engine cannot exploit any data sharing so that each process will have to interact with data sources independently issue data requests and fetch data over the network. This paper presents Request Window, a novel DQP mechanism that can detect and employ data sharing opportunities across concurrent distributed queries. By combining multiple similar data requests issued to the same data source to a common data request, Request Window allows concurrent query executing processes to share the common result data. With the benefits of reduced source burdens and data transfers, the throughput of query engine can be significantly improved. This paper also introduces the IGNITE system, an extended PostgreSQL with DQP support.

In such an analysis, critical numerical measures, such as profit and sales, fluctuate over time and form time-series data. Moreover, the time series data correspond to market segments, which are described by a set of attributes, such as age, gender, education, income level, and product-category, that form a multi-dimensional structure. To better understand market dynamics and predict future trends, it is crucial to study the dynamics of time-series in multi-dimensional market segments. This is a topic that has been largely ignored in time series and data cube research. In this study, we examine the issues of anomaly detection in multi-dimensional time-series data. We propose time-series data cube to capture the multi-dimensional space formed by the attribute structure. This facilitates the detection of anomalies based on expected values derived from higher level, \"more general\" time-series. Anomaly detection in a time-series data cube poses computational challenges, especially for high-dimensional, large data sets.

They have provided a multiple-world semantics for such data, and developed efficient ways to answer OLAP aggregation queries over the imprecise facts. These solutions, however, assume that the imprecise facts can be interpreted independently of one another, a key assumption that is often violated in practice. Indeed, imprecise facts in real-world applications are often correlated, and such correlations can be captured as domain integrity constraints (e.g., repairs with the same customer names and models took place in the same city, or a text span can refer to a person or a city, but not both). In this paper we provide a framework for answering OLAP aggregation queries over imprecise data in the presence of such domain constraints. We first describe a relatively simple yet powerful constraint language, and formalize what it means to take into account such constraints in query answering. Next, we prove that OLAP queries can be answered efficiently given a database D* of fact marginals. We then exploit the regularities in the constraint space (captured in a constraint hypergraph) and the fact space to efficiently construct D*.

Sel√ßuk Candan,Maria Luisa Sapino","80790|VLDB|2007|A General Framework for Modeling and Processing Optimization Queries|An optimization query asks for one or more data objects that maximize or minimize some function over the data set. We propose a general class of queries, model-based optimization queries, in which a generic model is used to define a wide variety of queries involving an optimization objective function andor a set of constraints on the attributes. This model can be used to define optimization of linear and nonlinear expressions over object attributes as well as many existing query types studied in database research literature. A significant and important subset of this general model relevant to real-world applications include queries where the optimization function and constraints are convex. We cast such queries as members of the convex optimization (CP) model and provide a unified query processing framework for CP queries that IO optimally accesses data and space partitioning index structures without changing the underlying structures. We perform experiments to show the generality of the technique and where possible, compare to techniques developed for specialized optimization queries. We find that we achieve nearly identical performance to the limited optimization query types with optimal solutions, while providing generic modeling and processing for a much broader class of queries, and while effectively handling problem constraints.|Michael Gibas,Ning Zheng,Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu","80789|VLDB|2007|Query Processing over Incomplete Autonomous Databases|Incompleteness due to missing attribute values (aka \"null values\") is very common in autonomous web databases, on which user accesses are usually supported through mediators. Traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness of answer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes, even if they wind up being relevant to a user query. Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such possible answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being pertinent answers to the query. The autonomous nature of web databases poses several challenges in realizing this objective. Such challenges include the restricted access privileges imposed on the data, the limited support for query patterns, and the bounded pool of database and network resources in the web environment. We introduce a novel query rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges. Our technique involves reformulating the user query based on mined correlations among the database attributes. The reformulated queries are aimed at retrieving the relevant possible answers in addition to the certain answers. QPIAD is able to gauge the relevance of such queries allowing tradeoffs in reducing the costs of database query processing and answer transmission. To support this framework, we develop methods for mining attribute correlations (in terms of Approximate Functional Dependencies), value distributions (in the form of Na&iumlve Bayes Classifiers), and selectivity estimates. We present empirical studies to demonstrate that our approach is able to effectively retrieve relevant possible answers with high precision, high recall, and manageable cost.|Garrett Wolf,Hemal Khatri,Bhaumik Chokshi,Jianchun Fan,Yi Chen,Subbarao Kambhampati","80852|VLDB|2007|Efficient Processing of Top-k Dominating Queries on Multi-Dimensional Data|The top-k dominating query returns k data objects which dominate the highest number of objects in a dataset.

Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables.\" We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than  million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.|Daniel J.

It is therefore of utmost importance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate schemas from sets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on the inference of Document Type Definitions (DTDs for short), we will consider the inference of XML Schema Definitions (XSDs for short) --- the increasingly popular schema formalism that is turning DTDs obsolete. In contrast to DTDs where the content model of an element depends only on the element's name, the content model in an XSD can also depend on the context in which the element is used. Hence, while the inference of DTDs basically reduces to the inference of regular expressions from sets of sample strings, the inference of XSDs also entails identifying from a corpus of sample documents the contexts in which elements bear different content models. Since a seminal result by Gold implies that no inference algorithm can learn the complete class of XSDs from positive examples only, we focus on a class of XSDs that captures most XSDs occurring in practice. For this class, we provide a theoretically complete algorithm that always infers the correct XSD when a sufficiently large corpus of XML documents is available.

Data encryption is the main technique for achieving security. While in the past enterprises were hesitant to implement database encryption because of the very high cost, complexity, and performance degradation, they now have to face the ever-growing risk of data theft as well as emerging legislative requirements. Data encryption can be done at multiple tiers within the enterprise. Different choices on where to encrypt the data offer different security features that protect against different attacks. One class of attack that needs to be taken seriously is the compromise of the database server, its software or administrator. A secure way to address this threat is for a DBMS to directly process queries on the ciphertext, without decryption. We conduct a comprehensive study on answering SUM and AVG aggregation queries in such a system model by using a secure homomorphic encryption scheme in a novel way. We demonstrate that the performance of such a solution is comparable to a traditional symmetric encryption scheme (e.g., DES) in which each value is decrypted and the computation is performed on the plaintext. Clearly this traditional encryption scheme is not a viable solution to the problem because the server must have access to the secret key and the plaintext, which violates our system model and security requirements. We study the problem in the setting of a read-optimized DBMS for data warehousing applications, in which SUM and AVG are frequent and crucial.|Tingjian Ge,Stanley B.

In such systems, the messages (generated by publishers) are encoded as XML documents, and the profiles (defined by subscribers) as XML query statements. As the number of documents and query requests grow, the performance and scalability of the matching phase (i.e. matching of queries to incoming documents) become vital. Current solutions have limited or no flexibility to prune out queries in advance. In this paper, we overcome such limitation by proposing a novel early pruning approach called Bounding-based XML Filtering or BoXFilter. The BoXFilter is based on a new tree-like indexing structure that organizes the queries based on their similarity and provides lower and upper bound estimations needed to prune queries not related to the incoming documents.

In query processing on probabilistic data, we can ignore the lineage and use materialized views to more efficiently answer queries. By contrast, if the view has explicit lineage, the query evaluation must reprocess the lineage to compute the query resulting in dramatically slower execution. The second application is information exchange when we do not wish to disclose the entire lineage, which otherwise may result in shipping the entire database. The paper contains several theoretical results that completely solve the problem of deciding whether a conjunctive view can be represented as a BID and whether a query on a partial representation is uniquely determined. We validate our approach experimentally showing that representable views exist in real and synthetic workloads and show over three magnitudes of improvement in query processing versus a lineage based approach.|Christopher Re,Dan Suciu","80766|VLDB|2007|Ranked Subsequence Matching in Time-Series Databases|Existing work on similar sequence matching has focused on either whole matching or range subsequence matching. In this paper, we present novel methods for ranked subsequence matching under time warping, which finds top-k subsequences most similar to a query sequence from data sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most sophisticated subsequence matching solution mentioned in the literature. Specifically, we first provide a new notion of the minimum-distance matching-window pair (MDMWP) and formally define the mdmwp-distance, a lower bound between a data subsequence and a query sequence. The mdmwp-distance can be computed prior to accessing the actual subsequence. Based on the mdmwp-distance, we then develop a ranked subsequence matching algorithm to prune unnecessary subsequence accesses. Next, to reduce random disk IOs and bad buffer utilization, we develop a method of deferred group subsequence retrieval. We then derive another lower bound, the window-group distance, that can be used to effectively prune unnecessary subsequence accesses during deferred group-subsequence retrieval. Through extensive experiments with many data sets, we showcase the superiority of the proposed methods.|Wook-Shin Han,Jinsoo Lee,Yang-Sae Moon,Haifeng Jiang","80764|VLDB|2007|Querying Complex Structured Databases|Correctly generating a structured query (e.g., an XQuery or a SQL query) requires the user to have a full understanding of the database schema, which can be a daunting task. Alternative query models have been proposed to give users the ability to query the database without schema knowledge. Those models, including simple keyword search and labeled keyword search, aim to extract meaningful data fragments that match the structure-free query conditions (e.g., keywords) based on various matching semantics. Typically, the matching semantics are content-based they are defined on data node inter-relationships and incur significant query evaluation cost. Our first contribution is a novel matching semantics based on analyzing the database schema. We show that query models employing a schema-based matching semantics can reduce query evaluation cost significantly while maintaining or even improving result quality. The adoption of schema-based matching semantics does not change the nature of those query models they are still schema-ignorant, i.e., users express no schema knowledge (except the labels in labeled keyword search) in the query. While those models work well for some queries on some databases, they often encounter problems when applied to complex queries on databases with complex schemas. Our second contribution is a novel query model that incorporates partial schema knowledge through the use of schema summary. This new summary-aware query model, called Meaningful Summary Query (MSQ), seamlessly integrates summary-based structural conditions and structure-free conditions, and enables ordinary users to query complex databases. We design algorithms for evaluating MSQ queries, and demonstrate that MSQ queries can produce better results against complex databases when compared with previous approaches, and that they can be efficiently evaluated.|Cong Yu,H. V. Jagadish","80789|VLDB|2007|Query Processing over Incomplete Autonomous Databases|Incompleteness due to missing attribute values (aka \"null values\") is very common in autonomous web databases, on which user accesses are usually supported through mediators. Traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness of answer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes, even if they wind up being relevant to a user query. Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such possible answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being pertinent answers to the query. The autonomous nature of web databases poses several challenges in realizing this objective. Such challenges include the restricted access privileges imposed on the data, the limited support for query patterns, and the bounded pool of database and network resources in the web environment. We introduce a novel query rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges. Our technique involves reformulating the user query based on mined correlations among the database attributes. The reformulated queries are aimed at retrieving the relevant possible answers in addition to the certain answers. QPIAD is able to gauge the relevance of such queries allowing tradeoffs in reducing the costs of database query processing and answer transmission. To support this framework, we develop methods for mining attribute correlations (in terms of Approximate Functional Dependencies), value distributions (in the form of Na&iumlve Bayes Classifiers), and selectivity estimates. We present empirical studies to demonstrate that our approach is able to effectively retrieve relevant possible answers with high precision, high recall, and manageable cost.|Garrett Wolf,Hemal Khatri,Bhaumik Chokshi,Jianchun Fan,Yi Chen,Subbarao Kambhampati","80858|VLDB|2007|What does Web  have to do with databases|Web . is a buzzword we have been hearing for over  years.

Typically, they automate important business tasks by orchestrating a number of applications and data stores. Obviously, the performance of a business process is directly dependent on the efficiency of data access, data processing, and data management. In this paper, we propose a framework for the optimization of data processing in business processes. We introduce a set of rewrite rules that transform a business process in such a way that an improved execution with respect to data management can be achieved without changing the semantics of the original process. These rewrite rules are based on a semi-procedural process graph model that externalizes data dependencies as well as control flow dependencies of a business process. Furthermore, we present a multi-stage control strategy for the optimization process. We illustrate the benefits and opportunities of our approach through a prototype implementation. Our experimental results demonstrate that independent of the underlying database system performance gains of orders of magnitude are achievable by reasoning about data and control in a unified framework.|Marko Vrhovnik,Holger Schwarz,Oliver Suhre,Bernhard Mitschang,Volker Markl,Albert Maier,Tobias Kraft","80816|VLDB|2007|Probabilistic Skylines on Uncertain Data|Uncertain data are inherent in some important applications. Although a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data and answering some types of queries on uncertain data, how to conduct advanced analysis on uncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper, we tackle the problem of skyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all the objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p. Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop two efficient algorithms. The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.|Jian Pei,Bin Jiang,Xuemin Lin,Yidong Yuan","80788|VLDB|2007|CADS Continuous Authentication on Data Streams|We study processing and authentication of long-running queries on outsourced data streams. In this scenario, a data owner (DO) constantly transmits its data to a service provider (SP), together with additional authentication information. Clients register continuous range queries to the SP. Whenever the data change, the SP must update the results of all affected queries and inform the clients accordingly. The clients can verify the correctness of the results using the authentication information provided by the DO. Compared to conventional databases, stream environments pose new challenges such as the need for fast structure updating, support for continuous query processing and authentication, and provision for temporal completeness. Specifically, in addition to the correctness of individual results, the client must be able to verify that there are no missing results in between updates. We face these challenges through several contributions. Since there is no previous work, we first present a technique, called REF, that achieves correctness and temporal completeness but incurs false transmissions, i.e., the SP has to inform clients whenever there is a data update, even if their results are not affected. Then, we propose CADS, which minimizes the processing and transmission overhead through an elaborate indexing scheme and a virtual caching mechanism. Finally, we extend CADS to the case where multiple owners outsource their data to the same SP. The SP integrates all data in a single authentication process, independently of the number of DOs.|Stavros Papadopoulos,Yin Yang,Dimitris Papadias","80840|VLDB|2007|Data Integration with Uncertainty|This paper reports our first set of results on managing uncertainty in data integration. We posit that data-integration systems need to handle uncertainty at three levels, and do so in a principled fashion. First, the semantic mappings between the data sources and the mediated schema may be approximate because there may be too many of them to be created and maintained or because in some domains (e.g., bioinformatics) it is not clear what the mappings should be. Second, queries to the system may be posed with keywords rather than in a structured form. Third, the data from the sources may be extracted using information extraction techniques and so may yield imprecise data. As a first step to building such a system, we introduce the concept of probabilistic schema mappings and analyze their formal foundations. We show that there are two possible semantics for such mappings by-table semantics assumes that there exists a correct mapping but we don't know what it is by-tuple semantics assumes that the correct mapping may depend on the particular tuple in the source data. We present the query complexity and algorithms for answering queries in the presence of approximate schema mappings, and we describe an algorithm for efficiently computing the top-k answers to queries in such a setting.|Xin Luna Dong,Alon Y. Halevy,Cong Yu","80849|VLDB|2007|Integrity Auditing of Outsourced Data|An increasing number of enterprises outsource their IT services to third parties who can offer these services for a much lower cost due to economy of scale. Quality of service is a major concern in outsourcing. In particular, query integrity, which means that query results returned by the service provider are both correct and complete, must be assured. Previous work requires clients to manage data locally to audit the results sent back by the server, or database engine to be modified for generating authenticated results. In this paper, we introduce a novel integrity audit mechanism that eliminating these costly requirements. In our approach, we insert a small amount of records into an outsourced database so that the integrity of the system can be effectively audited by analyzing the inserted records in the query results. We study both randomized and deterministic approaches for generating the inserted records, as how these records are generated has significant implications for storage and performance. Furthermore, we show that our method is provable secure, which means it can withstand any attacks by an adversary whose computation power is bounded. Our analytical and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.|Min Xie,Haixun Wang,Jian Yin,Xiaofeng Meng","80746|VLDB|2007|Secure Data Outsourcing|The networked and increasingly ubiquitous nature of today's data management services mandates assurances to detect and deter malicious or faulty behavior. This is particularly relevant for outsourced data frameworks in which clients place data management with specialized service providers. Clients are reluctant to place sensitive data under the control of a foreign party without assurances of confidentiality. Additionally, once outsourced, privacy and data access correctness (data integrity and query completeness) become paramount. Today's solutions are fundamentally insecure and vulnerable to illicit behavior, because they do not handle these dimensions. In this tutorial we will explore how to design and build robust, efficient, and scalable data outsourcing mechanisms providing strong security assurances of () correctness, () confidentiality, and () data access privacy. There exists a strong relationship between such assurances for example, the lack of access pattern privacy usually allows for statistical attacks compromising data confidentiality. Confidentiality can be achieved by data encryption. However, to be practical, outsourced data services should allow expressive client queries (e.g., relational joins with arbitrary predicates) without compromising confidentiality. This is a hard problem because decryption keys cannot be directly provided to potentially untrusted servers. Moreover, if the remote server cannot be fully trusted, protocol correctness become essential. Therefore, solutions that do not address all three dimensions are incomplete and insecure.|Radu Sion","80753|VLDB|2007|Deadline and QoS Aware Data Warehouse|A data warehouse infrastructure needs to support the requirement of (day time) ad hoc query response time and (night time) batch workload completion time.

Inconsistencies and errors in a database often emerge as violations of integrity constraints. Given a dirty database D, one needs automated methods to make it consistent, i.e., find a repair D' that satisfies the constraints and \"minimally\" differs from D. Equally important is to ensure that the automatically-generated repair D' is accurate, or makes sense, i.e., D' differs from the \"correct\" data within a predefined bound. This paper studies effective methods for improving both data consistency and accuracy. We employ a class of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) proposed in  to specify the consistency of the data, which are able to capture inconsistencies and errors beyond what their traditional counterparts can catch. To improve the consistency of the data, we propose two algorithms one for automatically computing a repair D' that satisfies a given set of CFDs, and the other for incrementally finding a repair in response to updates to a clean database. We show that both problems are intractable. Although our algorithms are necessarily heuristic, we experimentally verify that the methods are effective and efficient. Moreover, we develop a statistical method that guarantees that the repairs found by the algorithms are accurate above a predefined rate without incurring excessive user interaction.|Gao Cong,Wenfei Fan,Floris Geerts,Xibei Jia,Shuai Ma"]]}}
