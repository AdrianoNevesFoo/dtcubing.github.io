Integration may lead to more effective and richer cognitive computational models, and to a better understanding of the processes of artificial intelligence across the field. This paper presents a new model for the representation, computation, and learning of temporal logic in connectionist systems. The model allows for the encoding of past and future temporal logic operators in neural networks, through a neural-symbolic translation algorithms introduced in the paper. The networks are relatively simple and can be used for reasoning about time and for learning by examples with the use of standard neural learning algorithms. We validate the model in a well-known application dealing WIth temporal synchronisation in distributed knowledge systems. This opens several interesting research paths in cognitive modelling, with potential applications in agent technology, learning and reasoning.|Lu√≠s C. Lamb,Rafael V.

Neuroscientists believe that much of this common sense involves predictive models for physical activities, but the transfer of sensorimotor skill knowledge to cognition is non-trivial, indicating that SEAI may meet a daunting challenge of its own. This paper considers the neurological basis for procedural common sense and the possibilities for its transfer to conscious reasoning. This helps assess the prospects for SEAI to eventually surpass classic AI in the quest for generally intelligence systems.|Keith L.

The aim of this research is to develop an intrusion detection system based on the function of Dendritic Cells (DCs). DCs are antigen presenting cells and key to the activation of the human immune system, behaviour which has been abstracted to form the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA). In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion, asynchronously correlating the fused data signals with a secondary data stream. Aggregate output of a population of cells is analysed and forms the basis of an anomaly detection system. In this paper the DCA is applied to the detection of outgoing port scans using TCP SYN packets. Results show that detection can be achieved with the DCA, yet some false positives can be encountered when simultaneously scanning and using other network services. Suggestions are made for using adaptive signals to alleviate this uncovered problem.|Julie Greensmith,Uwe Aickelin","66270|AAAI|2007|Dominance and Equivalence for Sensor-Based Agents|This paper describes recent results from the robotics community that develop a theory, similar in spirit to the theory of computation, for analyzing sensor-based agent systems. The central element to this work is a notion of dominance of one such system over another. This relation is formally based on the agents' progression through a derived information space, but may informally be understood as describing one agent's ability to \"simulate\" another. We present some basic properties of this dominance relation and demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to a basic problem in robotics. We argue that this work is of interest to a broad audience of artificial intelligence researchers for two main reasons. First, it calls attention to the possibility of studying belief spaces in way that generalizes both probabilistic and nondeterministic uncertainty models. Second, it provides a means for evaluating the information that an agent is able to acquire (via its sensors and via conformant actions), independent of any optimality criterion and of the task to be completed.|Jason M.

This work investigates the contribution of gene libraries to Artificial Immune Systems by reproducing and extending an earlier system that used gene libraries. Performance on a job-shop scheduling problem is evaluated empirically with and without gene libraries, and with many different library configurations. We propose that gene libraries encourage diversity in a population of solutions and that the number of components in the gene library parameterises this effect. The number of gene libraries used is found to affect solution fitness and indeed using larger numbers of libraries (and therefore libraries of smaller components) enables higher fitness to be attained. We conclude that gene libraries are likely to be of use in applications where there is a need to maintain the diversity of solutions.|Peter Spellward,Tim Kovacs","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world. The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","58223|GECCO|2007|Modelling danger and anergy in artificial immune systems|Artificial Immune Systems are engineering systems which have been inspired from the functioning of the biological immune system. We present an immune system model which incorporates two biologically motivated mechanisms to protect against autoimmune reactions, or false positives. The first, anergy, has been subject to the intense focus of immunologists as a possible key to autoimmune disease. The second is danger theory, which has attracted much interest as a possible alternative to traditional self-nonself selection models.We adopt a published immunological model, validate and extend it. Using the same calculations and assumptions as the original model, we integrate danger theory into the software.Without anergy, both models - the original and the danger model - produce similar results. When anergy is added, both models' performance improves. However, there seems to be some synergy between the mechanisms anergy has a greater effect on the danger model than the original model. These findings should be of interest both to AIS practitioners and to the immunological community.|Steve Cayzer,Julie Sullivan","65976|AAAI|2007|Optimal Multi-Agent Scheduling with Constraint Programming|We consider the problem of computing optimal schedules in multi-agent systems. In these problems, actions of one agent can influence the actions of other agents, while the objective is to maximize the total 'quality' of the schedule. More specifically, we focus on multi-agent scheduling problems with time windows, hard and soft precedence relations, and a nonlinear objective function. We show how we can model and efficiently solve these problems with constraint programming technology. Elements of our proposed method include constraint-based reasoning, search strategies, problem decomposition, scheduling algorithms, and a linear programming relaxation.

We study the problem of planning in such domains and show how structured representations of the environment's dynamics can help partition the action space into a set of equivalence classes at run time. The partitioned action space is then used to produce a reduced set of actions. This technique speeds up search and can yield significant gains in planning efficiency.|Natalia Hernandez-Gardiol,Leslie Pack Kaelbling","66175|AAAI|2007|An Integrated Robotic System for Spatial Understanding and Situated Interaction in Indoor Environments|A major challenge in robotics and artificial intelligence lies in creating robots that are to cooperate with people in human-populated environments, e.g. for domestic assistance or elderly care.

We aim at a summarization system that can replicate the quality of summaries created by humans. In this paper we investigate the machine learning method for extracting full sentences from documents based on the document semantic graph structure. In particular, we explore how the Support Vector Machines (SVM) learning method is affected by the quality of linguistic analyses and the corresponding semantic graph representations. We apply two types of linguistic analysis () a simple part-of-speech tagging of noun phrases and verbs and () full logical form analysis which identifies Subject-Predicate-Object triples, and then build the semantic graphs. We train the SVM classifier to identify summary nodes and use these nodes to extract sentences. Experiments with the DUC  and CAST datasets show that the SVM based extraction of sentences does not differ significantly for the simple and the sophisticated syntactic analysis. In both cases the graph attributes used in learning are essential for the classifier performance and the quality of extracted summaries.|Jure Leskovec,Natasa Milic-Frayling,Marko Grobelnik","57472|GECCO|2005|Extraction of informative genes from microarray data|Identification of those genes that might anticipate the clinical behavior of different types of cancers is challenging due to availability of a smaller number of patient samples compared to huge number of genes, and the noisy nature of microarray data. After selection of some good genes based on signal-to-noise ratio, unsupervised learning like clustering and supervised learning like k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier are widely used in cancer researches to correlate the pathological behavior of cancers with the gene expression levels' differences in cancerous and normal tissues. By applying adaptive searches like Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Algorithm (PMBGA), it may be possible to get a smaller size gene subset that would classify patient samples more accurately than the above methods. In this paper, we propose a new PMBGA based method to extract informative genes from microarray data using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. We apply our method to three microarray data sets and present the experimental results. Our method with SVM obtains encouraging results on those data sets as compared with the rank based method using kNN as a classifier.|Topon Kumar Paul,Hitoshi Iba","65605|AAAI|2005|Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Multi-Class Support Vector Machines|We present new unsupervised and semi-supervised training algorithms for multi-class support vector machines based on semidefinite programming.

In this paper, we present a principled approach to unsupervised SVM training by formulating convex relaxations of the natural training criterion find a labeling that would yield an optimal SVM classifier on the resulting training data. The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well. While previous work has concentrated on the two-class case, we present a general, multi-class formulation that can be applied to a wider range of natural data sets.

In the meanwhile, Ensemble Learning, one of the most efficient approaches in supervised Machine Learning for the last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. Ensemble Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only (Off-EEL) or incrementally along evolution (On-EEL). Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that Off-EEL outperforms single-hypothesis evolutionary learning and state-of-art Boosting and generates smaller classifier ensembles.|Christian Gagn√©,Mich√®le Sebag,Marc Schoenauer,Marco Tomassini","58006|GECCO|2007|Support vector regression for classifier prediction|In this paper we introduce XCSF with support vector predictionthe problem of learning the prediction function is solved as a support vector regression problem and each classifier exploits a Support Vector Machine to compute the prediction.

Our new method extends a recent advice-giving technique, called Knowledge-Based Kernel Regression (KBKR), that accepts advice concerning a single action of a reinforcement learner. In KBKR, users can say that in some set of states, an action's value should be greater than some linear expression of the current state. In our new technique, which we call Preference KBKR (Pref-KBKR), the user can provide advice in a more natural manner by recommending that some action is preferred over another in the specified set of states. Specifying preferences essentially means that users are giving advice about policies rather than Q values, which is a more natural way for humans to present advice. We present the motivation for preference advice and a proof of the correctness of our extension to KBKR. In addition, we show empirical results that our method can make effective use of advice on a novel reinforcement-learning task, based on the RoboCup simulator, which we call Breakaway.

It is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. It requires less labeled data and it makes the test in a lower dimension, which speeds up the testing. Then, we provide a comprehensive comparison between SVM with different kernel functions and I-CFS-EM on several real datasets.

Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme.

Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables.\" We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than  million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.|Daniel J.

In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm.

Two useful heuristics are the hm heuristics, which generalize the reachability heuristic underlying the planning graph, and pattern database heuristics. These heuristics, however, have serious limitations reachability heuristics capture only the cost of critical paths in a relaxed problem, ignoring the cost of other relevant paths, while PDB heuristics, additive or not, cannot accommodate too many variables in patterns, and methods for automatically selecting patterns that produce good estimates are not known. We introduce two refinements of these heuristics First, the additive hm heuristic which yields an admissible sum of hm heuristics using a partitioning of the set of actions. Second, the constrained PDB heuristic which uses constraints from the original problem to strengthen the lower bounds obtained from abstractions. The new heuristics depend on the way the actions or problem variables are partitioned. We advance methods for automatically deriving additive hm and PDB heuristics from STRIPS encodings. Evaluation shows improvement over existing heuristics in several domains, although, not surprisingly, no heuristic dominates all the others over all domains.|Patrik Haslum,Blai Bonet,Hector Geffner","65426|AAAI|2005|Validating Plans in the Context of Processes and Exogenous Events|Complex planning domains push the boundaries of the expressive power of planning domain modelling languages.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","65467|AAAI|2005|Heterogeneous Multirobot Coordination with Spatial and Temporal Constraints|Existing approaches to multirobot coordination separate scheduling and task allocation, but finding the optimal schedule with joint tasks and spatial constraints requires robots to simultaneously solve the scheduling, task allocation, and path planning problems.

However, action specifications are often limited to avoid conflicts arising from preconditioneffect interactions. PDDL -- the planning domain definition language -- for example, implements the \"no moving targets\" rule, which means that no two actions can simultaneously make use of a value if one of the two is updating the value. This rule poses problems for resource allocation planning in which resource values are accessed in preconditions and effects. A simple example is construction actions that consume certain amounts of a resource. For speeding up plan execution, we would like to be able to dispatch several construction actions simultaneously. Because action preconditions depend on resource values and action effects change them, the \"no moving targets\" rule does not allow concurrent execution. However, if sufficient resources are available, executing actions simultaneously poses no problems. This paper addresses the problem of deciding whether a set of actions produced by a planning system can be executed concurrently in the presence of fluent variables that occur in both action preconditions and effects. We first motivate the concurrent action execution problem by introducing a fair action scheduling algorithm for real-time strategy (RTS) games. Then we prove that the general decision problem, when restricting effects and preconditions to polynomial time computations, is co-NP complete. Thereafter, we focus on problem restrictions based on commutative operators which allow us to specify sufficient conditions for concurrent executability that can be checked quickly if the number of shared fluents is small. Finally, we apply these findings to action execution with shared resources in RTS games.|Michael Buro,Alexander Kovarsky","65482|AAAI|2005|Prottle A Probabilistic Temporal Planner|Planning with concurrent durative actions and probabilistic effects, or probabilistic temporal planning, is a relatively new area of research.

This paper describes a detailed theoretical investigation of the notion of forgetting in the context of logic programming. We first provide a semantic definition of forgetting under the answer sets for extended logic programs. We then discuss the desirable properties and some motivating examples. An important result of this study is an algorithm for computing the result of forgetting in a logic program. Furthermore, we present a modified version of the algorithm and show that the time complexity of the new algorithm is polynomial with respect to the size of the given logic program if the size of certain rules is fixed. We show how the proposed theory of forgetting can be used to characterize the logic program updates.|Kewen Wang,Abdul Sattar,Kaile Su","65553|AAAI|2005|SymChaff A Structure-Aware Satisfiability Solver|We present a novel low-overhead framework for encoding and utilizing structural symmetry in propositional satisfiability algorithms (SAT solvers). We use the notion of complete multi-class symmetry and demonstrate the efficacy of our technique through a solver SymChaff that achieves exponential speedup by using simple tags in the specification of problems from both theory and practice. Efficient implementations of DPLL-based SAT solvers are routinely used in areas as diverse as planning, scheduling, design automation, model checking, verification, testing, and algebra. A natural feature of many application domains is the presence of symmetry, such as that amongst all trucks at a certain location in logistics planning and all wires connecting two switch boxes in an FPGA circuit. Many of these problems turn out to have a concise description in many-sorted first order logic. This description can be easily specified by the problem designer and almost as easily inferred automatically. SymChaff, an extension of the popular SAT solver zChaff, uses information obtained from the \"sorts\" in the first order logic constraints to create symmetry sets that are used to partition variables into classes and to maintain and utilize symmetry information dynamically. Current approaches designed to handle symmetry include (A) symmetry breaking predicates (SBPs), (B) pseudo-Boolean solvers with implicit representation for counting, (C) modifications of DPLL that handle symmetry dynamically, and (D) techniques based on ZBDDs. SBPs are prohibitively many, often large, and expensive to compute for problems such as the ones we report experimental results for. Pseudo-Boolean solvers are provably exponentially slow in certain symmetric situations and their implicit counting representation is not always appropriate. Suggested modifications of DPLL either work on limited global symmetry and are difficult to extend, or involve expensive algebraic group computations. Finally, techniques based on ZBDDs often do not compare well even with ordinary DPLL-based solvers. Sym-Chaff addresses and overcomes most of these limitations.|Ashish Sabharwal","66161|AAAI|2007|Forgetting Actions in Domain Descriptions|Forgetting irrelevantproblematic actions in a domain description can be useful in solving reasoning problems, such as query answering, planning, conftict resolution, prediction, postdiction, etc..

Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme. The proposed scheme reduces Pareto-size and the appropriate number of clusters can usually be determined.|Nobukazu Matake,Tomoyuki Hiroyasu,Mitsunori Miki,Tomoharu Senda","80736|VLDB|2007|An Approach to Optimize Data Processing in Business Processes|In order to optimize their revenues and profits, an increasing number of businesses organize their business activities in terms of business processes. Typically, they automate important business tasks by orchestrating a number of applications and data stores. Obviously, the performance of a business process is directly dependent on the efficiency of data access, data processing, and data management. In this paper, we propose a framework for the optimization of data processing in business processes. We introduce a set of rewrite rules that transform a business process in such a way that an improved execution with respect to data management can be achieved without changing the semantics of the original process. These rewrite rules are based on a semi-procedural process graph model that externalizes data dependencies as well as control flow dependencies of a business process. Furthermore, we present a multi-stage control strategy for the optimization process. We illustrate the benefits and opportunities of our approach through a prototype implementation.

Although a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data and answering some types of queries on uncertain data, how to conduct advanced analysis on uncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper, we tackle the problem of skyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all the objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p. Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop two efficient algorithms. The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.|Jian Pei,Bin Jiang,Xuemin Lin,Yidong Yuan","80762|VLDB|2007|On Dominating Your Neighborhood Profitably|Recent research on skyline queries has attracted much interest in the database and data mining community. Given a database, an object belongs to the skyline if it cannot be dominated with respect to the given attributes by any other database object. Current methods have only considered so-called minmax attributes like price and quality which a user wants to minimize or maximize. However, objects can also have spatial attributes like x, y coordinates which can be used to represent relevant constraints on the query results. In this paper, we introduce novel skyline query types taking into account not only minmax attributes but also spatial attributes and the relationships between these different attribute types. Such queries support a micro-economic approach to decision making, considering not only the quality but also the cost of solutions. We investigate two alternative approaches for efficient query processing, a symmetrical one based on off-the-shelf index structures, and an asymmetrical one based on index structures with special purpose extensions. Our experimental evaluation using a real dataset and various synthetic datasets demonstrates that the new query types are indeed meaningful and the proposed algorithms are efficient and scalable.|Cuiping Li,Anthony K.

A number of methods have recently been proposed for privacy preserving data mining of multidimensional data records. One of the methods for privacy preserving data mining is that of anonymization, in which a record is released only if it is indistinguishable from k other entities in the data. We note that methods such as k-anonymity are highly dependent upon spatial locality in order to effectively implement the technique in a statistically robust way. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and the concept of spatial locality is no longer easy to define from an application point of view. In this paper, we view the k-anonymization problem from the perspective of inference attacks over all possible combinations of attributes. We show that when the data contains a large number of attributes which may be considered quasi-identifiers, it becomes difficult to anonymize the data without an unacceptably high amount of information loss. This is because an exponential number of combinations of dimensions can be used to make precise inference attacks, even when individual attributes are partially specified within a range. We provide an analysis of the effect of dimensionality on k-anonymity methods. We conclude that when a data set contains a large number of attributes which are open to inference attacks, we are faced with a choice of either completely suppressing most of the data or losing the desired level of anonymity. Thus, this paper shows that the curse of high dimensionality also applies to the problem of privacy preserving data mining.|Charu C. Aggarwal","80813|VLDB|2007|Efficient Computation of Reverse Skyline Queries|In this paper, for the first time, we introduce the concept of Reverse Skyline Queries. At first, we consider for a multidimensional data set P the problem of dynamic skyline queries according to a query point q. This kind of dynamic skyline corresponds to the skyline of a transformed data space where point q becomes the origin and all points of P are represented by their distance vector to q. The reverse skyline query returns the objects whose dynamic skyline contains the query object q. In order to compute the reverse skyline of an arbitrary query point, we first propose a Branch and Bound algorithm (called BBRS), which is an improved customization of the original BBS algorithm. Furthermore, we identify a super set of the reverse skyline that is used to bound the search space while computing the reverse skyline. To further reduce the computational cost of determining if a point belongs to the reverse skyline, we propose an enhanced algorithm (called RSSA) that is based on accurate pre-computed approximations of the skylines. These approximations are used to identify whether a point belongs to the reverse skyline or not. Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets, we show that our algorithms can efficiently support reverse skyline queries. Our enhanced approach improves reversed skyline processing by up to an order of magnitude compared to the algorithm without the usage of pre-computed approximations.|Evangelos Dellis,Bernhard Seeger","65506|AAAI|2005|A Constraint Satisfaction Approach to Geospatial Reasoning|The large number of data sources on the Internet can be used to augment and verify the accuracy of geospatial sources, such as gazetteers and annotated satellite imagery.

This is particularly relevant for outsourced data frameworks in which clients place data management with specialized service providers. Clients are reluctant to place sensitive data under the control of a foreign party without assurances of confidentiality. Additionally, once outsourced, privacy and data access correctness (data integrity and query completeness) become paramount. Today's solutions are fundamentally insecure and vulnerable to illicit behavior, because they do not handle these dimensions. In this tutorial we will explore how to design and build robust, efficient, and scalable data outsourcing mechanisms providing strong security assurances of () correctness, () confidentiality, and () data access privacy. There exists a strong relationship between such assurances for example, the lack of access pattern privacy usually allows for statistical attacks compromising data confidentiality. Confidentiality can be achieved by data encryption. However, to be practical, outsourced data services should allow expressive client queries (e.g., relational joins with arbitrary predicates) without compromising confidentiality. This is a hard problem because decryption keys cannot be directly provided to potentially untrusted servers. Moreover, if the remote server cannot be fully trusted, protocol correctness become essential. Therefore, solutions that do not address all three dimensions are incomplete and insecure.|Radu Sion","80798|VLDB|2007|Modeling and Querying Vague Spatial Objects Using Shapelets|Research in modeling and querying spatial data has primarily focused on traditional \"crisp\" spatial objects with exact location and spatial extent.

In addition, we describe an implementation of this data model as an extension to PostgreSQL, including an indexing technique for shapelet objects.

Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.|Daniel J.

Two distinct algorithms (a stochastic hill climber and a tournament selection based GA) were used to search for optimal walks in several variants of the self avoiding walk problem. The robustness of the solutions obtained by the algorithms were compared, both with each other and with solutions obtained by a random sampling of the optimal solution space. The solutions found by the GA were, for most of the problem variants, significantly more robust than those found by either the hill climbing algorithm or random sampling. The solutions found by the hill climbing algorithm were often significantly less robust than those obtained through random sampling. .|Justin Schonfeld","57589|GECCO|2005|Molecular programming evolving genetic programs in a test tube|We present a molecular computing algorithm for evolving DNA-encoded genetic programs in a test tube.

Autonomous selection means that decisions regarding survival and reproduction are taken by the individuals themselves independently, without any central control.This allows for a fully distributed EA, where not only reproduction (crossover and mutation) but also selection is performed at local level. An unwanted consequence of adding and removing individuals in a non-synchronized manner is that the population size gets out of control too. This problem is resolved by addingan adaptation mechanism allowing individuals to regulate their own selection pressure. The key tothis is a gossiping algorithm that enables individuals to maintain estimates on the size andthe fitness of the population. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated on a test problem to show the viability of the idea and to gain insight into the run-time dynamics of such an algorithm.

It is therefore of utmost importance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate schemas from sets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on the inference of Document Type Definitions (DTDs for short), we will consider the inference of XML Schema Definitions (XSDs for short) --- the increasingly popular schema formalism that is turning DTDs obsolete. In contrast to DTDs where the content model of an element depends only on the element's name, the content model in an XSD can also depend on the context in which the element is used. Hence, while the inference of DTDs basically reduces to the inference of regular expressions from sets of sample strings, the inference of XSDs also entails identifying from a corpus of sample documents the contexts in which elements bear different content models. Since a seminal result by Gold implies that no inference algorithm can learn the complete class of XSDs from positive examples only, we focus on a class of XSDs that captures most XSDs occurring in practice. For this class, we provide a theoretically complete algorithm that always infers the correct XSD when a sufficiently large corpus of XML documents is available. In addition, we present a variant of this algorithm that works well on real-world (and therefore incomplete) data sets.|Geert Jan Bex,Frank Neven,Stijn Vansummeren","80816|VLDB|2007|Probabilistic Skylines on Uncertain Data|Uncertain data are inherent in some important applications.

We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all the objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p. Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop two efficient algorithms.

The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.|Jian Pei,Bin Jiang,Xuemin Lin,Yidong Yuan","65951|AAAI|2007|Learning Causal Models for Noisy Biological Data Mining An Application to Ovarian Cancer Detection|Undetected errors in the expression measurements from high-throughput DNA microarrays and protein spectroscopy could seriously affect the diagnostic reliability in disease detection. In addition to a high resilience against such errors, diagnostic models need to be more comprehensible so that a deeper understanding of the causal interactions among biological entities like genes and proteins may be possible. In this paper, we introduce a robust knowledge discovery approach that addresses these challenges. First, the causal interactions among the genes and proteins in the noisy expression data are discovered automatically through Bayesian network learning. Then, the diagnosis of a disease based on the network is performed using a novel error-handling procedure, which automatically identifies the noisy measurements and accounts for their uncertainties during diagnosis. An application to the problem of ovarian cancer detection shows that the approach effectively discovers causal interactions among cancer-specific proteins.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm. The experimental results indicate that MeSwarm outperforms the standard PSO and several evolutionary algorithms in terms of solution quality.|Bo-Fu Liu,Hung-Ming Chen,Jian-Hung Chen,Shiow-Fen Hwang,Shinn-Ying Ho","58208|GECCO|2007|Two-level of nondominated solutions approach to multiobjective particle swarm optimization|In multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) methods, selecting the local best and the global best for each particle of the population has a great impact on the convergence and diversity of solutions, especially when optimizing problems with high number of objectives.

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) using evolution strategies for its optimization problem frequently deliver better results with respect to the optimization criterion and the prediction accuracy. Moreover, evolutionary computation allows for the efficient large margin optimization of a huge family of new kernel functions, namely non-positive semi definite kernels as the Epanechnikov kernel. For these kernel functions, evolutionary SVM even outperform other learning methods like the Relevance Vector Machine. In this paper, we will discuss another major advantage of evolutionary SVM compared to traditional SVM solutions we can explicitly optimize the inherent trade-off between training error and model complexity by embedding multi-objective optimization into the evolutionary SVM. This leads to three advantages first, it is no longer necessary to tune the SVM parameter C which weighs both conflicting criteria. This is a very time-consuming task for traditional SVM. Second, the shape and size of the Pareto front give interesting insights about the complexity of the learning task at hand. Finally, the user can actually see the point where overfitting occurs and can easily select a solution from the Pareto front best suiting his or her needs.|Ingo Mierswa","66198|AAAI|2007|Mapping and Revising Markov Logic Networks for Transfer Learning|Transfer learning addresses the problem of how to leverage knowledge acquired in a source domain to improve the accuracy and speed of learning in a related target domain.

However, the prediction accuracy is not satisfactory and binding site prediction thus remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we develop an approach that can be used to predict binding site motifs using a genetic algorithm. Based on the generic framework of a genetic algorithm, the approach explores the search space of all possible starting locations of the binding site motifs in different target sequences with a population that undergoes evolution. Individuals in the population compete to participate in the crossovers and mutations occur with a certain probability. Initial experiments demonstrated that our approach could achieve high prediction accuracy in a small amount of computation time.

However, existing event detection research mainly focused only on the stream properties of social text streams but ignored the contextual, temporal, and social information embedded in the streams.

We represent social text streams as multi-graphs, where each node represents a social actor and each edge represents the information flow between two actors. The content and temporal associations within the flow of information are embedded in the corresponding edge. Events are detected by combining text based clustering, temporal segmentation, and information flow-based graph cuts of the dual graph of the social networks.

With experimental and observational data coming in particular from sensors, online simulations, etc., the data has an inherently streaming nature. Furthermore, continuing advances will result in even higher data volumes, rendering storing all of the delivered data prior to processing increasingly impractical. Hence, in such e-science scenarios, processing and sharing of data streams will play a decisive role. It will enable new possibilities for researchers, since they will be able to subscribe to interesting data streams of other scientists without having to set up their own devices or experiments. This results in much better utilization of expensive equipment such as telescopes, satellites, etc. Further, processing and sharing data streams on-the-fly in the network helps to reduce network traffic and to avoid network congestion. Thus, even huge streams of data can be handled efficiently by removing unnecessary parts early on, e. g., by early filtering and aggregation, and by sharing previously generated data streams and processing results.|Richard Kuntschke,Bernhard Stegmaier,Alfons Kemper,Angelika Reiser","65393|AAAI|2005|Scaling Up Word Sense Disambiguation via Parallel Texts|A critical porblem faced by current supervised WSD systems is the lack or manually annotated training data.

In this scenario, a data owner (DO) constantly transmits its data to a service provider (SP), together with additional authentication information. Clients register continuous range queries to the SP. Whenever the data change, the SP must update the results of all affected queries and inform the clients accordingly. The clients can verify the correctness of the results using the authentication information provided by the DO. Compared to conventional databases, stream environments pose new challenges such as the need for fast structure updating, support for continuous query processing and authentication, and provision for temporal completeness. Specifically, in addition to the correctness of individual results, the client must be able to verify that there are no missing results in between updates. We face these challenges through several contributions. Since there is no previous work, we first present a technique, called REF, that achieves correctness and temporal completeness but incurs false transmissions, i.e., the SP has to inform clients whenever there is a data update, even if their results are not affected. Then, we propose CADS, which minimizes the processing and transmission overhead through an elaborate indexing scheme and a virtual caching mechanism.

An advanced text classification technique is known as partially supervised text classification, which can build a text classifier using a small set of positive examples only. This leads to our curiosity whether it is possible to find a set of features that can be used to describe the positive examples. Therefore, users do not even need to specify a set of positive examples. As the first step, in this paper, we formalize it as a new problem, called hot bursty events detection, to detect bursty events from a text stream which is a sequence of chronologically ordered documents. Here, a bursty event is a set of bursty features, and is considered as a potential category to build a text classifier. It is important to know that the hot bursty events detection problem, we study in this paper, is different from TDT (topic detection and tracking) which attempts to cluster documents as events using clustering techniques. In other words, our focus is on detecting a set of bursty features for a bursty event. In this paper, we propose a new novel parameter free probabilistic approach, called feature-pivot clustering.

A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution.

For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states. We also show its superior performance over the centralized schemes in terms of update, query, and total communication costs.|Arnab Bhattacharya,Anand Meka,Ambuj K.

When plans are turned into the instructions that drive an executive, the real behaviours interacting with the unpredictable uncertainties of the environment can lead to failure. One of the challenges for intelligent autonomy is to recognise when the actual execution of a behaviour has diverged so far from the expected behaviour that it can be considered to be a failure. In this paper we present an approach by which a trace of the execution of a behaviour is monitored by tracking its most likely explanation through a learned model of how the behaviour is normally executed. In this way, possible failures are identified as deviations from common patterns of the execution of the behaviour. We perform an experiment in which we inject errors into the behaviour of a robot performing a particular task, and explore how well a learned model of the task can detect where these errors occur.|Maria Fox,Jonathan Gough,Derek Long"],["57488|GECCO|2005|The problem with a self-adaptative mutation rate in some environments a case study using the shaky ladder hyperplane-defined functions|Dynamic environments have periods of quiescence and periods of change. In periods of quiescence a Genetic Algorithm (GA) should (optimally) exploit good individuals while in periods of change the GA should (optimally) explore new solutions. Self-adaptation is a mechanism which allows individuals in the GA to choose their own mutation rate, and thus allows the GA to control when it explores new solutions or exploits old ones. We examine the use of this mechanism on a recently devised dynamic test suite, the Shaky Ladder Hyperplane-Defined Functions (sl-hdf's). This test suite can generate random problems with similar levels of difficulty and provides a platform allowing systematic controlled observations of the GA in dynamic environments. We show that in a variety of circumstances self-adaptation fails to allow the GA to perform better on this test suite than fixed mutation, even when the environment is static. We also show that mutation is beneficial throughout the run of a GA, and that seeding a population with known good genetic material is not always beneficial to the results. We provide explanations for these observations, with particular emphasis on comparing our results to other results  which have shown the GA to work in static environments. We conclude by giving suggestions as to how to change the simple GA to solve these problems.|William Rand,Rick L.

Additional procedures are designed to improve the overall performance and the robustness of the immune-inspired approach, giving rise to a version for dynamic optimization, denoted dopt-aiNet. Firstly, challenging benchmark problems in static multimodal optimization are considered to validate the new proposal. No parameter adjustment is necessary to adapt the algorithm according to the peculiarities of each problem.

As most decision variables of characteristic determination problems are real numbers due to the modeling of physical phenomena, and ECGA is designed for handling discrete-type problems, a specific mechanism to transform the variable types of the two ends is in order. In the proposed framework, ECGA is used as a back-end optimization engine, and SoD is adopted as the interface between the engine and the problem. Moreover, instead of one mathematical model with various parameters, characteristic determination is in fact a set of problems of which the mathematical formulations may be very different. Therefore, in this study, we employ the proposed framework on three study cases to demonstrate that the technique proposed in the domain of evolutionary computation can provide not only the high quality optimization results but also the flexibility to handle problems of different formulations.|Ping-Chu Hung,Ying-Ping Chen,Hsiao Wen Zan","65501|AAAI|2005|On the Evaluation of Dynamic Critiquing A Large-Scale User Study|Critiquing is an important form of feedback in conversational recommender systems.

It uses a data clustering algorithm to detect clusters in GA population, which identifies the attractors in the fitness landscape. Then, subpopulations which makes-up the clusters are isolated and optimized independently. Meanwhile, the region of the isolated subpopulations in the original landscape are suppressed. The isolation increases comprehensiveness, i.e., the probability of finding weaker attractors, and the overall efficiency of multimodal search. The advantage of the AIM is that it does not require distance between the optima as a presumed parameter, as it is estimated from the variancecovariance matrix of the subpopulation.Further, AIM's behavior and efficiency is equivalent to basic GA in unimodal landscape, in terms of number of evaluation. Therefore, it is applied recursively to all subpopulations until they converge to a suboptima. This makes AIM suitable for locally-multimodal landscapes, which have closely located attractors that are difficult to distinguish in the initial run.The performance of AIM is evaluated in several benchmark problems and compared to iterated hill-climbing methods.|Shin Ando,Jun Sakuma,Shigenobu Kobayashi","57399|GECCO|2005|Efficient differential evolution using speciation for multimodal function optimization|In this paper differential evolution is extended by using the notion of speciation for solving multimodal optimization problems.

And indeed, counter-intuitively to some extent, locating its global maximum seems to be not an easy task for Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). Although this research originates from the real-world applications domain, it aims to introduce a theoretical test case to Evolution Strategies (ES), being a possible theoretical gateway to the real-world physics regime of quantum control problems. After presenting some theoretical results, this paper introduces the study of the scalability of the decision space subject to optimization by specific variants of Derandomized Evolution Strategies.

However, in many application domains the classical super solutions framework is not expressive enough since it only reasons about the number of breaks in a solution and the number of changes that are necessary to find a repair. For example, in combinatorial auctions we may wish to guarantee that we can always find a repair solution whose revenue exceeds some threshold while limiting the cost associated with forming such a repair. In this paper we present the weighted super solution framework that involves two important extensions. Firstly, the set of variables that may lose their values is determined using a probabilistic approach enabling us to find repair solutions for assignments that are most likely to fail. Secondly, we include a mechanism for reasoning about the cost of repair. The proposed framework has been successfully used to find robust solutions to combinatorial auctions.|Alan Holland,Barry O'Sullivan","57450|GECCO|2005|Evolution of a human-competitive quantum fourier transform algorithm using genetic programming|In this paper, we show how genetic programming (GP) can be used to evolve system-size-independent quantum algorithms, and present a human-competitive Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) algorithm evolved by GP.|Paul Massey,John A.

Genomes are expressed in one of several developmental environments, and selected using a fitness function favouring stability, height, and distribution of pressure. Positive results are found in nearly all cases, demonstrating that environment can be used as an effective spatial constraint on development.

This strengthens the notion that growth via Artificial Embryogeny can be resistant to perturbations in environment, and that good designs may be re-used in a variety of contexts.|Taras Kowaliw,Peter Grogono,Nawwaf N.

The analysis of both fitness and diversity of the populations provides an insight into the improved performance provided by lifetime learning. The NK fitness landscape model is employed as the problem task, which has the advantage of being able to generate a variety of fitness landscapes of varying difficulty. Experiments observe the response of populations in an environment where problem difficulty increases and decreases with varying frequency. Results show that lifetime learning is capable of overall higher fitness levels and, in addition, that lifetime learning stimulates the diversity of the population. This increased diversity allows lifetime learning a greater level of recovery and stability than evolutionary learning alone.|Dara Curran,Colm O'Riordan,Humphrey Sorensen"],["57966|GECCO|2007|Discovering structures in gene regulatory networks using genetic programming and particle swarms|In this paper, we describe a Genetic Programming and Particle Swarm Hybrid algorithm for Gene Network discovery.|Xinye Cai,Stephen Welch,Praveen Koduru,Sanjoy Das","57904|GECCO|2007|Association rule mining for continuous attributes using genetic network programming|Most association rule mining algorithms make use of discretization algorithms for handling continuous attributes. However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method. In addition to that, the threshold ai is also evolved by mutation between i - aisi, i + aisi in every generation in order to obtain as many association rules as possible. The features of the proposed method are as follows compared with other methods ) Extracts rules without identifying frequent itemsets used in Apriori-like mining methods. ) Stores extracted important association rules in a pool all together through generations. ) Measures the significance of associations via the chi-squared test. ) Extracts important rules sufficient enough for user's purpose in a short time. ) The pool is updated in every generation and only important association rules with higher chi-squared value are stored when the identical rules are stored. We have evaluated the proposed method by doing two simulations. Simulation  uses fixed threshold values that is, they remain fixed at initial thresholds during evolution. In simulation ,thresholds are evolved by mutation in every generation. Fig.  shows the number of rules extracted in the pool in simulation . It is found that the number of rules extracted has been increased, which means simulation  outperforms simulation .|Karla Taboada,Kaoru Shimada,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","58114|GECCO|2007|Coevolution of intelligent agents using cartesian genetic programming|A coevolutionary competitive learning environment for two antagonistic agents is presented. The agents are controlled by a new kind of computational network based on a compartmentalised model of neurons. We have taken the view that the genetic basis of neurons is an important  and neglected aspect of previous approaches. Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents. Our results show that both agents exhibit interesting learning capabilities.|Gul Muhammad Khan,Julian Francis Miller,David M.

Indeed, the growth in the computing power of these graphics cards is now several orders of magnitude greater than the growth in the power of computer processor units. Thus these graphics cards are now beginning to be used by the scientific community aslow cost, high performance computing platforms. Traditional genetic programming is a highly computer intensive algorithm but due to its parallel nature it can be distributed over multiple processors to increase the speed of the algorithm considerably. This is not applicable for single processor architectures but graphics cards provide a mechanism for developing a data parallel implementation of genetic programming. In this paper we will describe the technique of general purpose computing using graphics cards and how to extend this technique to genetic programming. We will demonstrate the improvement in the performance of genetic programming on single processor architectures which can be achieved by harnessing the computing power of these next generation graphics cards.|Darren M.

The redesign process can alter the topological connections among components and can introduce additional components. The air pump system is a mixed-domain system that includes electromagnetic, mechanical and pneumatic elements. Bond graphs are domain independent, allow free composition, and are efficient for classification and analysis of models. Genetic programming is well recognized as a powerful tool for open-ended search. The combination of these two powerful methods, BGGP, was applied for redesign of an air pump system.|Kisung Seo,Erik D. Goodman,Ronald C.

However, the topological structure of a system may set a limit on the possible robustness achievable through parameter tuning. This paper proposes a new robust design paradigm that exploits the open-ended topological synthesis capability of genetic programming to evolve more robust systems. As a case study, a methodology for automated synthesis of dynamic systems, based on genetic programming and bond graph modeling (GPBG), is applied to evolve robust low-pass and high-pass analog filters. Compared with a traditional robust design approach based on a state-of-the-art real-parameter genetic algorithm (GA), it is shown that open-ended topology search by genetic programming with a fitness criterion rewarding robustness can evolve more robust systems with respect to parameter perturbations than what was achieved through parameter tuning alone, for our test problems.|Jianjun Hu,Xiwei Zhong,Erik D.

This is usually done manually, based on theoretical understanding and previously established equations. In this work, for a particular problem in hydraulics, human induction of equations is compared with the use of genetic programming. It will be shown that even with the use of synthetic data for training, genetic programming was capable of identifying a relationship that was more concise and more accurate than the relationship uncovered by scientists. As such this is a human-competitive result. Furthermore it will be shown that the genetic programming induced expression could be embedded in a line of theoretical work, filling in a few gaps in an already established line of reasoning. The resulting equation is the most accurate and elegant formulation of vegetation induced resistance to date.|Maarten Keijzer,Martin Baptist,Vladan Babovic,Javier Rodriguez Uthurburu","57895|GECCO|2007|Peptide detectability following ESI mass spectrometry prediction using genetic programming|The accurate quantification of proteins is important in several areas of cell biology, biotechnology and medicine. Both relative and absolute quantification of proteins is often determined following mass spectrometric analysis of one or more of their constituent peptides. However, in order for quantification to be successful, it is important that the experimenter knows which peptides are readily detectable under the mass spectrometric conditions used for analysis. In this paper, genetic programming is used to develop a function which predicts the detectability of peptides from their calculated physico-chemical properties. Classification is carried out in two stages the selection of a good classifier using the AUROC objective function and the setting of an appropriate threshold. This allows the user to select the balance point between conflicting priorities in an intuitive way. The success of this method is found to be highly dependent on the initial selection of input parameters. The use of brood recombination and a modified version of the multi-objective FOCUS method are also investigated. While neither has a significant effect on predictive accuracy, the use of the FOCUS method leads to considerably more compact solutions.|David C. Wedge,Simon J. Gaskell,Simon J. Hubbard,Douglas B.

One example are dynamic problems that change with time. An important class of dynamic problems is the class of tracking problems where an algorithm has to find an approximately optimal solution and insure an almost constant quality in spite of the changing problem. For the application of evolutionary algorithms to static optimization problems, the distribution of the optimization time and most often its expected value are most important. Adopting this perspective a simple tracking problem in the lattice is considered and the performance of a mutation-based evolutionary algorithm is evaluated. For the static case, asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds are proven. These results are applied to derive results on the tracking performance for different rates of change.|Thomas Jansen,Ulf Schellbach","58031|GECCO|2007|Option pricing model calibration using a real-valued quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm|Quantum effects are a natural phenomenon and just like evolution, or immune processes, can serve as an inspiration for the design of computing algorithms.

The goal is to identify groups of mutants that show maximally different fluxome profiles.
