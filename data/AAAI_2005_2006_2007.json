MDPs are often applied in situations where there is a clear choice of reward functions and in these cases significant care must be taken to construct a reward function that induces the desired behavior. In this paper, we consider an analogous design problem crafting a target distribution in Targeted Trajectory Distribution MDPs (TTD-MDPs). TTD-MDPs produce probabilistic policies that minimize divergence from a target distribution of trajectories from an underlying MDP. They are an extension of MDPs that provide variety of experience during repeated execution. Here, we present a brief overview of TTD-MDPs with approaches for constructing target distributions. Then we present a novel authorial idiom for creating target distributions using prototype trajectories. We evaluate these approaches on a drama manager for an interactive game.|David L.

We consider cumulative intermediate reward to be the difference between our score and our opponent's score the \"true\" reward of a win, loss, or tie is determined at the end of a game by applying a threshold function to the cumulative intermediate reward. We introduce thresholded-rewards problems to capture this dependency of the final reward outcome on the cumulative intermediate reward. Thresholded-rewards problems reflect different real-world stochastic planning domains, especially zero-sum games, in which time and score need to be considered. We investigate the application of thresholded rewards to finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In general, the optimal policy for a thresholded-rewards MDP will be non-stationary, depending on the number of time steps remaining and the cumulative intermediate reward. We introduce an efficient value iteration algorithm that solves thresholded-rewards MDPs exactly, but with running time quadratic on the number of states in the MDP and the length of the time horizon. We investigate a number of heuristic-based techniques that efficiently find approximate solutions for MDPs with large state spaces or long time horizons.|Colin McMillen,Manuela M.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","66064|AAAI|2007|Optimizing Anthrax Outbreak Detection Using Reinforcement Learning|The potentially catastrophic impact of a bioterrorist attack makes developing effective detection methods essential for public health. In the case of anthrax attack, a delay of hours in making a right decision can lead to hundreds of lives lost. Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision. We present empirical evidence illustrating that the performance of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and timeliness is improved significantly by utilizing POMDPs.|Masoumeh T.

However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted. Based on the semi-MDP (sMDP) model, we study the hard constrained (HC) problem in continuous time, state and action spaces with respect to both finite and infinite horizons, and various cost criteria. We show that the HCsMDP problem is NP-hard and that there exists an equivalent discrete-time MDP to every HCsMDP.

The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well.

In a WiFi environment, a mobile device can be localized using signals received from various transmitters, such as access points (APs). Most localization approaches build a map between the signal space and the physical location space in a offline phase, and then using the received-signal-strength (RSS) map to estimate the location in an online phase. However, the map can be outdated when the signal-strength values change with time due to environmental dynamics. It is infeasible or expensive to repeat data calibration for reconstructing the RSS map. In such a case, it is important to adapt the model learnt in one time period to another time period without too much recalibration. In this paper, we present a location-estimation approach based on Manifold co-Regularization, which is a machine learning technique for building a mapping function between data. We describe LeManCoR, a system for adapting the mapping function between the signal space and physical location space over different time periods based on Manifold Co-Regularization. We show that LeManCoR can effectively transfer the knowledge between two time periods without requiring too much new calibration effort. We illustrate LeMan-CoR's effectiveness in a real .

They allow a system to take advantage of prior domain knowledge supplied either by a human user or another algorithm, combining that knowledge with data to produce accurate models. A limitation of the use of prior knowledge occurs when the provided knowledge is incorrect. Such knowledge likely still contains useful information, but knowledge-based learners might not be able to fully exploit such information. In fact, incorrect knowledge can lead to poorer models than result from knowledge-free learners. We present a support-vector method for incorporating and refining domain knowledge that not only allows the learner to make use of that knowledge, but also suggests changes to the provided knowledge. Our approach is built on the knowledge-based classification and regression methods presented by Fung, Mangasarian, & Shavlik ( ) and by Mangasarian, Shavlik, & Wild (). Experiments on artificial data sets with known properties, as well as on a real-world data set, demonstrate that our method learns more accurate models while also adjusting the provided rules in intuitive ways.

Our new method extends a recent advice-giving technique, called Knowledge-Based Kernel Regression (KBKR), that accepts advice concerning a single action of a reinforcement learner. In KBKR, users can say that in some set of states, an action's value should be greater than some linear expression of the current state. In our new technique, which we call Preference KBKR (Pref-KBKR), the user can provide advice in a more natural manner by recommending that some action is preferred over another in the specified set of states. Specifying preferences essentially means that users are giving advice about policies rather than Q values, which is a more natural way for humans to present advice. We present the motivation for preference advice and a proof of the correctness of our extension to KBKR. In addition, we show empirical results that our method can make effective use of advice on a novel reinforcement-learning task, based on the RoboCup simulator, which we call Breakaway. Our work demonstrates the significant potential of advice-giving techniques for addressing complex reinforcement learning problems, while further demonstrating the use of support-vector regression for reinforcement learning.|Richard Maclin,Jude W.

Large action sets, however, have received considerably less attention. This paper demonstrates the use of knowledge transfer between related tasks to accelerate learning with large action sets. We introduce action transfer, a technique that extracts the actions from the (near-)optimal solution to the first task and uses them in place of the full action set when learning any subsequent tasks. When optimal actions make up a small fraction of the domain's action set, action transfer can substantially reduce the number of actions and thus the complexity of the problem. However, action transfer between dissimilar tasks can be detrimental. To address this difficulty, we contribute randomized task perturbation (RTP), an enhancement to action transfer that makes it robust to unrepresentative source tasks. We motivate RTP action transfer with a detailed theoretical analysis featuring a formalism of related tasks and a bound on the suboptimality of action transfer. The empirical results in this paper show the potential of RTP action transfer to substantially expand the applicability of RL to problems with large action sets.|Alexander A.

Our main contribution in this work is to provide a way to compactly represent such mappings using relationships between state variables in the two domains. We use these functions to transfer a learned policy in the first domain into an option in the new domain, and apply intra-option learning methods to bootstrap learning in the new domain.

This is mainly useful for continuous domains, where there is little guidance and many choices for the parametric distribution families to be used for the local conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network, and only a few have been examined analytically. We therefore focus on BN structure learning in continuous domains. We address the problem by developing a conditional independence test for continuous variables, which can be readily used by any existing independence-based BN structure learning algorithm. Our test is non-parametric, making no assumptions on the distribution of the domain. We also provide an effective and computationally efficient method for calculating it from data. We demonstrate the learning of the structure of graphical models in continuous domains from real-world data, to our knowledge for the first time using independence-based methods and without distributional assumptions. We also experimentally show that our test compares favorably with existing statistical approaches which use prediscretization, and verify desirable properties such as statistical consistency.|Dimitris Margaritis"],["65677|AAAI|2006|Computing Slater Rankings Using Similarities among Candidates|Voting (or rank aggregation) is a general method for aggregating the preferences of multiple agents. One important voting rule is the Slater rule. It selects a ranking of the alternatives (or candidates) to minimize the number of pairs of candidates such that the ranking disagrees with the pairwise majority vote on these two candidates. The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates. We show that this technique suffices to compute a Slater ranking in linear time if the pairwise majority graph is hierarchically structured. For the general case, we also give an efficient algorithm for finding a set of similar candidates.

Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered. In this paper we define three measures for quantifying the incentive compatibility of ranking systems.

It requires the learning algorithms themselves to be in equilibrium for any game selected from a set of (initially unknown) games. In an optimal ELE, the learning algorithms would efficiently obtain the surplus the agents would obtain in an optimal Nash equilibrium of the initially unknown game which is played. The crucial part is that in an ELE deviations from the learning algorithms would become nonbeneficial after polynomial time, although the game played is initially unknown. While appealing conceptually, the main challenge for establishing learning algorithms based on this concept is to isolate general classes of games where an ELE exists. Unfortunately, it has been shown that while an ELE exists for the setting in which each agent can observe all other agents' actions and payoffs, an ELE does not exist in general when the other agents' payoffs cannot be observed. In this paper we provide the first positive results on this problem, constructively proving the existence of an optimal ELE for the class of symmetric games where an agent can not observe other agents' payoffs.|Ronen I.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm"],["66092|AAAI|2007|A Connectionist Cognitive Model for Temporal Synchronisation and Learning|The importance of the efforts towards integrating the symbolic and connectionist paradigms of artificial intelligence has been widely recognised.

First, it calls attention to the possibility of studying belief spaces in way that generalizes both probabilistic and nondeterministic uncertainty models. Second, it provides a means for evaluating the information that an agent is able to acquire (via its sensors and via conformant actions), independent of any optimality criterion and of the task to be completed.|Jason M.

We recognize the importance of policies for securing the Web and believe that the future will only bring more policy languages. We do not, however, believe that users should be forced to conform the description of their policy relationships to a single standard policy language. Instead there should be a way of encompassing different policy languages and supporting heterogeneous policy systems. As a step in this direction, we propose Rein, a policy framework grounded in Semantic Web technologies, which leverages the distributed nature and linkability of the Web to provide Web-based policy management. Rein provides ontologies for describing policy domains in a decentralized manner and provides an engine for reasoning over these descriptions, both of which can be used to develop domain and policy language specific security systems. We describe the Rein policy framework and discuss how a Rein policy management systems can be developed for access control in an online photo sharing application.|Lalana Kagal,Tim Berners-Lee,Dan Connolly,Daniel J.

First, we must devise affect recognition models to detect student affect. Second, we need to determine when to intervene these conditions are likely to be different for each student. To determine how much frustration a student can persist through, we should utilize models of student self-efficacy to predict a student's frustration threshold. Third, we should devise techniques for responding empathetically before the student reaches her threshold of frustration. We propose an approach to support students' coping with frustration in intelligent tutoring systems that utilizes induced models of affect, self-efficacy and empathetic behavior to effectively reason about precisely when and how to intervene in frustration-ridden learning situations.|Scott W.

Unfortunately, even approximate planning in POMDPs is known to be hard, and developing heuristic planners that can deliver reasonable results in practice has proved to be a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to approximate value-iteration for POMDP planning that is based on quadratic rather than piecewise linear function approximators. Specifically, we approximate the optimal value function by a convex upper bound composed of a fixed number of quadratics, and optimize it at each stage by semidefinite programming. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive approximation quality to current techniques while still maintaining a bounded size representation of the function approximator. Moreover, an upper bound on the optimal value function can be preserved if required. Overall, the technique requires computation time and space that is only linear in the number of iterations (horizon time).|Tao Wang,Pascal Poupart,Michael H.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","65906|AAAI|2006|Point-based Dynamic Programming for DEC-POMDPs|We introduce point-based dynamic programming (DP) for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDPs), a new discrete DP algorithm for planning strategies for cooperative multi-agent systems.

Building on this insight, we then show how the linear programming part in current multi-agent DP algorithms can be avoided, and how multi-agent DP can thus be applied to solve larger problems.

A number of optimal basis functions are determined by the algorithm to minimize the Bellman residual incrementally, via efficient computations. We show that, by using optimally determined basis functions, the policy can be improved successively on a set of most probable belief points sampled from the reachable belief set.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs. Our empirical results show that our modified IP on mPSRs outperforms, in most cases, IP on both PSRs and POMDPs.|Michael R. James,Satinder P.

Users can also attack or support parts of existing arguments, use existing parts of an argument in the creation of new arguments, or create new argumentation schemes.

This semantic similarity score is used by AI planning algorithms to guide the searching process when composing services. Experimental results indicate that planning with semantic matching produces better results than planning or semantic matching alone.

The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates.

We model the coordination between the agents as a constraint graph, and adapt several algorithms from the distributed CSP area, to use as the basis for the diagnosis algorithms. We evaluate the algorithms in extensive experiments with simulated and real Sony Aibo robots and show that in general a trade-off exists between the computational requirements of the algorithms, and their diagnosis results.

The agents need to ensure that the service providers they select are trustworthy. Because the agents are autonomous and there is no central trusted authority, the agents help each other determine the trustworthiness of the service providers they are interested in. This help is rendered via a series of referrals to other agents, culminating in zero or more trustworthy service providers being identified. A trust network is a multiagent system where each agent potentially rates the trustworthiness of another agent. This paper develops a formal treatment of trust networks. At the base is a recently proposed representation of trust via a probability certainty distribution. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of two operators, concatenation and aggregation, using which trust ratings can be combined in a trust network. This paper motivates and establishes some important properties regarding these operators, thereby ensuring that trust can be combined correctly.

Each argumentation system gives both a set of arguments and the way they interact (i.e. attack or non-attack) according to the corresponding agent. The aim is to define the argument system (or the set of argument systems) that best represents the group.

An important criterion for assessing the quality of an allocation of resources, in terms of fairness, is envy-freeness an agent is said to envy another agent if it would prefer to swap places with that other agent. We analyse under what circumstances a sequence of deals respecting the negotiation topology may be expected to converge to a state where no agent envies any of the agents it is directly connected to. We also analyse the computational complexity of a related decision problem, namely the problem of checking whether a given negotiation state admits any deal that would both be beneficial to every agent involved and reduce envy in the agent society.|Yann Chevaleyre,Ulrich Endriss,Nicolas Maudet","65626|AAAI|2006|Quantifying Incentive Compatibility of Ranking Systems|Reasoning about agent preferences on a set of alternatives, and the aggregation of such preferences into some social ranking is a fundamental issue in reasoning about multi-agent systems.

Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered. In this paper we define three measures for quantifying the incentive compatibility of ranking systems. We apply these measures to several known ranking systems, such as PageRank, and prove tight bounds on the level of incentive compatibility under two basic properties strong monotonicity and non-imposition.

In this paper we present a new framework, named the Multi-Agent Inductive Learning System (MAILS), that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents. The MAILS framework combines inverse entailment with an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge in a multi-agent setting, facilitating a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates when required.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm"],["65692|AAAI|2006|Unifying Logical and Statistical AI|Intelligent agents must be able to handle the complexity and uncertainty of the real world.

We present some basic properties of this dominance relation and demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to a basic problem in robotics. We argue that this work is of interest to a broad audience of artificial intelligence researchers for two main reasons. First, it calls attention to the possibility of studying belief spaces in way that generalizes both probabilistic and nondeterministic uncertainty models. Second, it provides a means for evaluating the information that an agent is able to acquire (via its sensors and via conformant actions), independent of any optimality criterion and of the task to be completed.|Jason M.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","65609|AAAI|2005|Bitbots Simple Robots Solving Complex Tasks|Sensing uncertainty is a central issue in robotics.

For example, consider the problem of multirobot surveillance (Ahmadi & Stone ), in which a team of robots must collaboratively patrol a given area. If any two robots can directly communicate at all times, the robots can coordinate for efficient behavior. This condition holds trivially in environments that are smaller than the robots' communication range. However in larger environments, the robots must actively maintain physical locations such that any two robots can communicate -- possibly through a series of other robots. Otherwise, the robots may lose track of each others' activities and become miscoordinated. Furthermore, since robots are relatively unreliable andor may need to change tasks (for example if a robot is suddenly called by a human user to perform some other task), in a stable multirobot surveillance system, if one of the robots leaves or crashes, the rest should still be able to communicate. Some examples of other tasks that could benefit from any pair of robots being able to communicate with each other, are multi-robot exploration, search and rescue, and cleaning robots. We say that robot R is connected to robot R if there is a series of robots, each within communication range of the previous, which can pass a message from R to R. It is not possible to maintain connectivity in the face of arbitrary numbers of robot departures if there are any two robots that are not within communication of one another and all other robots simultaneously depart, the system becomes disconnected. Thus we focus on the property of remaining robust to any single failure under the assumption that the team can readjust its positioning in response to a departure more quickly than a second departure will occur. In order for the team to stay connected, even in the face of any single departure, it must be the case that every robot is connected to each other robot either directly or via two distinct paths that do not share any robots in common. We call this property biconnectivity the removal of any one robot from the system does not disconnect the remaining robots from each other.|Mazda Ahmadi,Peter Stone","66107|AAAI|2007|Predictive Exploration for Autonomous Science|Often remote investigations use autonomous agents to observe an environment on behalf of absent scientists.

It does so by sampling deterministic action sequences and then performing exact filtering on those sequences. These results are promising for applications in stochastic planning, natural language processing, and robot control.|Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Eyal Amir"],["65710|AAAI|2006|Inconsistencies Negations and Changes in Ontologies|Ontology management and maintenance are considered cornerstone issues in current Semantic Web applications in which semantic integration and ontological reasoning play a fundamental role. The ability to deal with inconsistency and to accommodate change is of utmost importance in real-world applications of ontological reasoning and management, wherein the need for expressing negated assertions also arises naturally. For this purpose, precise, formal definitions of the the different types of inconsistency and negation in ontologies are required. Unfortunately, ontology languages based on Description Logics (DLs) do not provide enough expressive power to represent axiom negations. Furthermore, there is no single, well-accepted notion of inconsistency and negation in the Semantic Web community, due to the lack of a common and solid foundational framework. In this paper, we propose a general framework accounting for inconsistency, negation and change in ontologies. Different levels of negation and inconsistency in DL-based ontologies are distinguished. We demonstrate how this framework can provide a foundation for reasoning with and management of dynamic ontologies.|Giorgos Flouris,Zhisheng Huang,Jeff Z.

In this paper we propose a mean of performing automated Web service composition by exploiting semantic matchmaking between Web service parameters (i.e., outputs and inputs) to enable their connection and interaction. The key idea is that the matchmaking enables, at run time, finding semantic compatibilities among independently defined Web service descriptions. To this end, our approach extends existing methods in order to explain misconnections between Web services. From this we generate Web service compositions that realize the goal, satisfying and optimizing the semantic connections between Web services. Moreover a process of relaxing the hard constraints is introduced in case the composition process failed. Our system is implemented and interacting with Web services dedicated on a Telecom scenario.

Approximation has been identified as a potential way to reduce the complexity of query answering over OWL DL ontologies. Existing approaches are mainly based on syntactic approximation of ontological axioms and queries. In this paper, we propose to recast the idea of knowledge compilation into approximating OWL DL ontologies with DL-Lite ontologies, against which query answering has only polynomial data complexity. We identify a useful category of queries for which our approach guarantees also completeness. Furthermore, this paper reports on the implementation of our approach in the ONTOSEARCH system and preliminary, but encouraging, benchmark results which compare ONTOSEARCH's response times on a number of queries with those of existing ontology reasoning systems.|Jeff Z.

First, we extend the recently proposed Argument Interchange Format (AIF) to express arguments with a structure based on Walton's theory of argumentation schemes. Then, we describe an implementation of this ontology using the RDF Schema language, and demonstrate how our ontology enables the representation of networks of arguments on the Semantic Web. Finally, we present a pilot Semantic Web-based system, ArgDF, through which users can create arguments using different argumentation schemes and can query arguments using a Semantic Web query language. Users can also attack or support parts of existing arguments, use existing parts of an argument in the creation of new arguments, or create new argumentation schemes.

The logics of the DL-Lite family were specifically designed to meet such requirements and optimized w.r.t. the data complexity of answering complex types of queries. In this paper we propose DL-Litebool, an extension of DL-Lite with full Booleans and number restrictions, and study the complexity of reasoning in DL-Litebool and its significant sub-logics. We obtain our results, together with useful insights into the properties of the studied logics, by a novel reduction to the one-variable fragment of first-order logic. We study the computational complexity of satisfiability and subsumption, and the data complexity of answering positive existential queries (which extend unions of conjunctive queries). Notably, we extend the LOGSPACE upper bound for the data complexity of answering unions of conjunctive queries in DL-Lite to positive queries and to the possibility of expressing also number restrictions, and hence local functionality in the TBox.|Alessandro Artale,Diego Calvanese,Roman Kontchakov,Michael Zakharyaschev","65893|AAAI|2006|The Synthy Approach for End to End Web Services Composition Planning with Decoupled Causal and Resource Reasoning|Web services offer a unique opportunity to simplify application integration by defining common, web-based, platform-neutral, standards for publishing service descriptions to a registry, finding and invoking them - not necessarily by the same parties. Viewing software components as web services, the current solutions to web services composition based on business web services (using WSDL, BPEL, SOAP etc.) or semantic web services (using ontologies, goal-directed reasoning etc.) are both piecemeal and insufficient for building practical applications. Inspired by the work in Al planning on decoupling causal (planning) and resource reasoning (scheduling), we introduced the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the current approaches. The solution is based on a novel two-staged composition approach that addresses the information modeling aspects of web services, provides support for contextual information while composing services, employs efficient decoupling of functional and non-functional requirements, and leads to improved scalability and failure handling. A prototype of the solution has been implemented in the Synthy service composition system and applied to a number of composition scenarios from the telecom domain. The application of planning to web services has also brought new plan and planner usability-driven research issues to the fore for AI.|Biplav Srivastava","65625|AAAI|2006|A Platform to Evaluate the Technology for Service Discovery in the Semantic Web|Since the description of the Semantic Web paradigm in , technology has been proposed to allow its deployment and use.

Many such attacks, launched by \"recreational hackers\" have already led to severe disruptions and significant cost. It, therefore, is critical that we find ways to protect such systems and to enable them to continue functioning even after a successful attack. This paper describes AWDRAT, a middleware system for providing survivability to both new and legacy applications. AWDRAT stands for Architectural-differencing, Wrappers, Diagnosis, Recovery, Adaptive software, and Trust-modeling. AWDRAT uses these techniques to gain visibility into the execution of an application system and to compare the application's actual behavior to that which is expected. In the case of a deviation, AWDRAT conducts a diagnosis that figures out which computational resources are likely to have been compromised and then adds these assessments to its trust-model. The trust model in turn guides the recovery process, particularly by guiding the system in its choice among functionally equivalent methods and resources. AWDRAT has been used on an example application system, a graphical editor for constructing mission plans. We present data showing the effectiveness of AWDRAT in detecting a variety of compromises to the application system.|Howard E. Shrobe,Robert Laddaga,Robert Balzer,Neil M.

In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of a \"real\" Semantic Web, our experiments have provided us with some interesting insights into how it is evolving and the type of queries that can be answered.|Zhengxiang Pan,Abir Qasem,Jeff Heflin","65381|AAAI|2005|An Inference Model for Semantic Entailment in Natural Language|Semantic entailment is the problem of determining if the meaning of a given sentence entails that of another. This is a fundamental problem in natural language understanding that provides a broad framework for studying language variability and has a large number of applications.

We describe a prototype system, Learning Reader, which combines natural language processing, a large-scale knowledge base, and analogical processing to learn by reading simplified language texts. We outline the architecture of Learning Reader and some of system-level results, then explain how these results arise from the components. Specifically, we describe the design, implementation, and performance characteristics of a natural language understanding model (DMAP) that is tightly coupled to a knowledge base three orders of magnitude larger than previous attempts. We show that knowing the kinds of questions being asked and what might be learned can help provide more relevant, efficient reasoning. Finally, we show that analogical processing provides a means of generating useful new questions and conjectures when the system ruminates off-line about what it has read.|Kenneth D.

Digital certificates are widely used for that purpose. However, practical certification scenarios can be very complex. Each certiticate carries a validity period and can be revoked during this period. Furthermore, the verifying user has to trust the issuers of certificates and revocations. This work presents a formal model which covers these aspects and provides a theoretical foundation for the decision about attribute authenticity even in complex scenarios. The model is based on the event calculus, an AI technique from the field of temporal reasoning. It uses Clark's completion to address the frame problem. An example illustrates the application of the model.|Thomas W√∂lfl"],["65814|AAAI|2006|Learning Representation and Control in Continuous Markov Decision Processes|This paper presents a novel framework for simultaneously learning representation and control in continuous Markov decision processes. Our approach builds on the framework of proto-value functions, in which the underlying representation or basis functions are automatically derived from a spectral analysis of the state space manifold. The proto-value functions correspond to the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian. We describe an approach to extend the eigenfunctions to novel states using the Nystrm extension. A least-squares policy iteration method is used to learn the control policy, where the underlying subspace for approximating the value function is spanned by the learned proto-value functions. A detailed set of experiments is presented using classic benchmark tasks, including the inverted pendulum and the mountain car, showing the sensitivity in performance to various parameters, and including comparisons with a parametric radial basis function method.|Sridhar Mahadevan,Mauro Maggioni,Kimberly Ferguson,Sarah Osentoski","65542|AAAI|2005|Constraint-Based Preferential Optimization|We first show that the optimal and undominated outcomes of an unconstrained (and possibly cyclic) CP-net are the solutions of a set of hard constraints. We then propose a new algorithm for finding the optimal outcomes of a constrained CP-net which makes use of hard constraint solving. Unlike previous algorithms, this new algorithm works even with cyclic CP-nets. In addition. the algorithm is not tied to CP-nets, but can work with any preference formalism which produces a preorder over the outcomes. We also propose an approximation method which weakens the preference ordering induced by the CP-net, returning a larger set of outcomes, but provides a significant computational advantage. Finally, we describe a weighted constraint approach that allows to find good solutions even when optimals do not exist.|Steven David Prestwich,Francesca Rossi,Kristen Brent Venable,Toby Walsh","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world. The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","65728|AAAI|2006|Analysis of Privacy Loss in Distributed Constraint Optimization|Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) is rapidly emerging as a prominent technique for multi agent coordination. However, despite agent privacy being a key motivation for applying DCOPs in many applications, rigorous quantitative evaluations of privacy loss in DCOP algorithms have been lacking. Recently, Maheswaran et al.  introduced a framework for quantitative evaluations of privacy in DCOP algorithms, showing that some DCOP algorithms lose more privacy than purely centralized approaches and questioning the motivation for applying DCOPs. This paper addresses the question of whether state-of-the art DCOP algorithms suffer from a similar shortcoming by investigating several of the most efficient DCOP algorithms, including both DPOP and ADOPT. Furthermore, while previous work investigated the impact on efficiency of distributed contraint reasoning design decisions (e.g. constraint-graph topology, asynchrony, message-contents), this paper examines the privacy aspect of such decisions, providing an improved understanding of privacy-efficiency tradeoffs.|Rachel Greenstadt,Jonathan P.

The ODPOP algorithm explores the same search space as the dynamic programming algorithm DPOP (Petcu & Faltings b) or ADOPT (Modi et at. ). but does so in an incremental, best-first fashion suitable for open problems. ODPOP has several advantages over DPOP. First, it uses messages whose size only grows linearly with the treewidth of the problem. Second, by letting agents explore values in a best-first order, it avoids incurring always the worst case complexity as DPOP, and on average it saves a significant amount of computation and information exchange. To show the merits of our approach, we report on experiments with practically sized distributed meeting scheduling problems on a multiagent system.|Adrian Petcu,Boi Faltings","66125|AAAI|2007|Transposition Tables for Constraint Satisfaction|In this paper, a state-based approach for the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is proposed. The key novelty is an original use of state memorization during search to prevent the exploration of similar subnetworks. Classical techniques to avoid the resurgence of previously encountered conflicts involve recording conflict sets. This contrasts with our state-based approach which records subnetworks - a snapshot of some selected domains - already explored. This knowledge is later used to either prune inconsistent states or avoid recomputing the solutions of these subnetworks. Interestingly enough, the two approaches present some complementarity different states can be pruned from the same partial instantiation or conflict set, whereas different partial instantiations can lead to the same state that needs to be explored only once. Also, our proposed approach is able to dynamically break some kinds of symmetries (e.g. neighborhood interchangeability). The obtained experimental results demonstrate the promising prospects of state-based search.|Christophe Lecoutre,Lakhdar Sais,S√©bastien Tabary,Vincent Vidal","66271|AAAI|2007|Generating and Solving Logic Puzzles through Constraint Satisfaction|Solving logic puzzles has become a very popular past-time, particularly since the Sudoku puzzle started appearing in newspapers all over the world.

Our generator guarantees that puzzles have unique solutions, have graded difficulty, and can be solved using inference alone. This demonstration provides a fun application of many standard constraint satisfaction techniques, such as problem formulation, global constraints, search and inference. It is ideal as both an education and outreach tool.

The previous state-of-the-art system achieves temporal preference optimization using a SAT formulation, with its creators attributing its performance to advances in SAT solving techniques. We depart from the SAT encoding and instead introduce the Valued DTP (VDTP). In contrast to the traditional semiring-based formalism that annotates legal tuples of a constraint with preferences, our framework instead assigns elementary costs to the constraints themselves. After proving that the VDTP can express the same set of utilitarian optimal solutions as the DTPP with piecewise-constant preference functions, we develop a method for achieving weighted constraint satisfaction within a meta-CSP search space that has traditionally been used to solve DTPs without preferences. This allows us to directly incorporate several powerful techniques developed in previous decision-based DTP literature. Finally, we present empirical results demonstrating that an implementation of our approach consistently outperforms the SAT-based solver by orders of magnitude.|Michael D. Moffitt,Martha E.

Existing approaches that solve Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) suffer from the fact that they can only solve relatively small problems without complex constraints on task execution. OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings. Experimental results are shown to support our claims.|Aur√©lie Beynier,Abdel-Illah Mouaddib","65933|AAAI|2006|Hard Constrained Semi-Markov Decision Processes|In multiple criteria Markov Decision Processes (MDP) where multiple costs are incurred at every decision point, current methods solve them by minimising the expected primary cost criterion while constraining the expectations of other cost criteria to some critical values. However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted. Based on the semi-MDP (sMDP) model, we study the hard constrained (HC) problem in continuous time, state and action spaces with respect to both finite and infinite horizons, and various cost criteria. We show that the HCsMDP problem is NP-hard and that there exists an equivalent discrete-time MDP to every HCsMDP. Hence, classical methods such as reinforcement learning can solve HCsMDPs.|Wai-Leong Yeow,Chen-Khong Tham,Wai-Choong Wong"],["66187|AAAI|2007|An Intelligent System for Chinese Calligraphy|Our work links Chinese calligraphy to computer science through an integrated intelligence approach.

Defaults have a uniform representation under all three interpretations in the new logic. Moreover, the logic itself is monotonic, that is, nonmonotonic reasoning is cast in terms of validity in the classical sense. While Lakemeyer and Levesque gave a model-theoretic account of their logic, a proof-theoretic characterization remained open. This paper fills that gap for the propositional subset a sound and complete axiom system in the new logic for all three varieties of default reasoning. We also present formal derivations for some examples of default reasoning.

Behaviosites are code modules that \"infect\" a system, attaching themselves to agents and altering the sensory activity and actions of those agents. These behavioral changes can be used to achieve altered, potentially improved, performance of the overall system thus, Behaviosites provide a mechanism for distributed control over a distributed system. Behaviosites need to be designed so that they are intimately familiar with the internal workings of the environment and of the agents operating within it. To demonstrate our approach, we use behaviosites to control the behavior of a swarm of simple agents. With a relatively low infection rate, a few behaviosites can engender desired behavior over the swarm as a whole keeping it in one place, leading it through checkpoints, or moving the swarm from one stable equilibrium to another. We contrast behaviosites as a distributed swarm control mechanism with alternatives, such as the use of group leaders, herders, or social norms.|Amit Shabtay,Zinovi Rabinovich,Jeffrey S.

In either case, significant training is required. AutoFeed follows a third, more ambitious approach, in which unsupervised learning is used to analyze sites and discover their structure. Our method relies on a set of heterogeneous \"experts\", each of which is capable of identifying certain types of generic structure. Each expert represents its discoveries as \"hints\".

To identify a good clustering, we use a probabilistic model of the hint-generation process.

Part of bridging this gap consists of allowing user and robot to establish joint reference on objects in the environment - without forcing the user to use unnatural means for object reference.

Our object recognition approach assigns natural categories (e.g. \"desk\", \"chair\", \"table\") to new objects based on their functional design.

A concurrent hybrid automaton is a powerful modeling concept to capture such a system's behavior in terms a concurrent composition of hybrid automata for the individual system components. Because of the potentially large number of modes of the concurrent automaton model it is non-trivial to validate the composition such that every possible operational mode leads to a causally valid dynamic model for the overall system. This paper presents a novel model analysis method that validates the automata composition without the necessity to analyze a prohibitively large number of modes. We achieve this by formulating the exhaustive causal analysis of hybrid automata as a diagnosis problem. This provides causal specifications of the component automata and enables us to efficiently calculate the causal relationships for their concurrent composition and thus validate a concurrent automaton model.|Michael W.

We show this methodology in action for the reasoning service previously proposed by Liu, Lakemeyer and Levesque for dealing with disjunctive information.

Large action sets, however, have received considerably less attention. This paper demonstrates the use of knowledge transfer between related tasks to accelerate learning with large action sets. We introduce action transfer, a technique that extracts the actions from the (near-)optimal solution to the first task and uses them in place of the full action set when learning any subsequent tasks. When optimal actions make up a small fraction of the domain's action set, action transfer can substantially reduce the number of actions and thus the complexity of the problem. However, action transfer between dissimilar tasks can be detrimental. To address this difficulty, we contribute randomized task perturbation (RTP), an enhancement to action transfer that makes it robust to unrepresentative source tasks. We motivate RTP action transfer with a detailed theoretical analysis featuring a formalism of related tasks and a bound on the suboptimality of action transfer. The empirical results in this paper show the potential of RTP action transfer to substantially expand the applicability of RL to problems with large action sets.|Alexander A.

To provide a natural and satisfying formalization of these attitudes is a longstanding problem in the community of agent theory. Most of existing modal logic approaches are based on Kripke structures and have to face the so-called side-effect problem. This paper presents a new modal logic formalizing agents' pro attitudes, based on neighborhood models. There are three distinguishing features of this logic. Firstly, this logic naturally satisfies Bratman's requirements for agents' beliefs and pro attitudes, as well as some interesting properties that have not been discussed before. Secondly, we give a sound and complete axiom system for characterizing all the valid properties of beliefs and pro attitudes.

This problem makes decision trees to be large and learnable only when sufficient training data are available. In this paper, we present a new representation model, conditional independence trees (CITrees), to tackle the replication problem from probability perspective. We propose a novel algorithm for learning CITrees. Our experiments show that CITrees outperform naive Bayes (Langley, Iba, & Thomas ), C. (Quinlan ), TAN (Friedman, Geiger, & Goldszmidt ), and AODE (Webb, Boughton, & Wang ) significantly in classification accuracy.|Jiang Su,Harry Zhang","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world. The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","66010|AAAI|2007|A Unification of Extensive-Form Games and Markov Decision Processes|We describe a generalization of extensive-form games that greatly increases representational power while still allowing efficient computation in the zero-sum setting. A principal feature of our generalization is that it places arbitrary convex optimization problems at decision nodes, in place of the finite action sets typically considered. The possibly-infinite action sets mean we must \"forget\" the exact action taken (feasible solution to the optimization problem), remembering instead only some statistic sufficient for playing the rest of the game optimally. Our new model provides an exponentially smaller representation for some games in particular, we show how to compactly represent (and solve) extensive-form games with outcome uncertainty and a generalization of Markov decision processes to multi-stage adversarial planning games.|H. Brendan McMahan,Geoffrey J. Gordon","65704|AAAI|2006|When a Decision Tree Learner Has Plenty of Time|The majority of the existing algorithms for learning decision trees are greedy--a tree is induced top-down, making locally optimal decisions at each node. In most cases, however, the constructed tree is not globally optimal. Furthermore, the greedy algorithms require a fixed amount of time and are not able to generate a better tree if additional time is available. To overcome this problem. we present a lookahead-based algorithm for anytime induction of decision trees which allows trading computational speed for tree quality. The algorithm uses a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits a stochastic version of ID is repeatedly invoked to estimate the size of the tree in which each split results, and the split that minimizes the expected size is preferred. Experimental results indicate that for several hard concepts, our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields significantly better decision trees when more time is available.|Saher Esmeir,Shaul Markovitch","65523|AAAI|2005|Markov Decision Processes for Control of a Sensor Network-based Health Monitoring System|Optimal use of energy is a primary concern in fielddeployable sensor networks. Artificial intelligence algorithms offer the capability to improve the performance or sensor networks in dynamic environments by minimizing energy utilization while not compromising overall performance. However, they have been used only to a limited extent in sensor networks primarily due to their expensive computing requirements. We describe the use of Markov decision processes for the adaptive control of sensor sampling rates in a sensor network used for human health monitoring. The MDP controller is designed to gather optimal information about the patient's health while guaranteeing a minimum lifetime of the system. At every control step, the MDP controller varies the frequency at which the data is collected according to the criticality of the patient's health at that time. We present a stochastic model that is used to generate the optimal policy offline. In cases where a model of the observed process is not available a-priori. we descrihe a Q-learning technique to learn the control policy, by using a pre-existing master controller. Simulation results that illustrate the performance of the controller are presented.|Anand Panangadan,Syed Muhammad Ali,Ashit Talukder","65652|AAAI|2006|An Iterative Algorithm for Solving Constrained Decentralized Markov Decision Processes|Despite the significant progress to extend Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to cooperative multi-agent systems, developing approaches that can deal with realistic problems remains a serious challenge. Existing approaches that solve Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) suffer from the fact that they can only solve relatively small problems without complex constraints on task execution. OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings. Experimental results are shown to support our claims.|Aur√©lie Beynier,Abdel-Illah Mouaddib","65933|AAAI|2006|Hard Constrained Semi-Markov Decision Processes|In multiple criteria Markov Decision Processes (MDP) where multiple costs are incurred at every decision point, current methods solve them by minimising the expected primary cost criterion while constraining the expectations of other cost criteria to some critical values. However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted. Based on the semi-MDP (sMDP) model, we study the hard constrained (HC) problem in continuous time, state and action spaces with respect to both finite and infinite horizons, and various cost criteria. We show that the HCsMDP problem is NP-hard and that there exists an equivalent discrete-time MDP to every HCsMDP. Hence, classical methods such as reinforcement learning can solve HCsMDPs.|Wai-Leong Yeow,Chen-Khong Tham,Wai-Choong Wong"],["65511|AAAI|2005|Error Bounds for Approximate Value Iteration|Approximate Value Iteration (AVI) is an method for solving a Markov Decision Problem by making successive calls to a supervised learning (SL) algorithm. Sequence of value representations Vn are processed iteratively by Vn+  ATVn where T is the Bellman operator and A an approximation operator. Bounds on the error between the performance of the policies induced by the algorithm and the optimal policy are given as a function of weighted Lp-norms (p  ) of the approximation errors. The results extend usual analysis in L-norm, and allow to relate the performance of AVI to the approximation power (usually expressed in Lp-norm, for p   or ) of the SL algorithm. We illustrate the tightness of these bounds on an optimal replacement problem.|R√©mi Munos","65589|AAAI|2005|Value Functions for RL-Based Behavior Transfer A Comparative Study|Temporal difference (TD) learning methods (Sutton & Barto ) have hecome popular reinforcement learning techniques in recent years. TD methods, relying on function approximators to generalize learning to novel situations, have had some experimental successes and have heen shown to exhibit some desirable properties in theory, but have often been found slow in practice. This paper presents methods for further generalizing across tasks, thereby speeding up learning. via a novel form of behavior transfer. We compare learning on a complex task with three function approximators, a CMAC, a neural network, and an RBF, and demonstrate that behavior transfer works well with all three. Using behavior transfer, agents are able to learn one task and then markedly reduce the time it takes to learn a more complex task. Our algorithms are fully implemented and tested in the RoboCup-soccer keepaway domain.|Matthew E.

In this paper, we show how to apply these techniques to new models for non-Markovian dynamical systems called Predictive State Representatiolls (PSRs) and Memory-PSRs (mPSRs). PSRs and mPSRs are models of non-Markovian decision processes that differ from latent-variable models (e.g. HMMs, POMDPs) by representing state using only observable quantities. Further, mPSRs explicitly represent certain structural properties of the dynamical system that are also relevant to planning. We show how planning techniques can be adapted to leverage this structure to improve performance both in terms of execution time as well as quality of the resulting policy.|Michael R.

One-switch utility functions are an important class of nonlinear utility functions that can model decision makers whose decisions change with their wealth level. We study how to maximize the expected utility of a Markov decision problem for a given one-switch utility function, which is difficult since the resulting planning problem is not decomposable. We first study an approach that augments the states of the Markov decision problem with the wealth level. The properties of the resulting infinite Markov decision problem then allow us to generalize the standard risk-neutral version of value iteration from manipulating values to manipulating functions that map wealth levels to values. We use a probabilistic blocks-world example to demonstrate that the resulting risk-sensitive version of value iteration is practical.|Yaxin Liu,Sven Koenig","65799|AAAI|2006|Value-Function-Based Transfer for Reinforcement Learning Using Structure Mapping|Transfer learning concerns applying knowledge learned in one task (the source) to improve learning another related task (the target). In this paper, we use structure mapping, a psychological and computational theory about analogy making, to find mappings between the source and target tasks and thus construct the transfer functional automatically. Our structure mapping algorithm is a specialized and optimized version of the structure mapping engine and uses heuristic search to find the best maximal mapping. The algorithm takes as input the source and target task specifications represented as qualitative dynamic Bayes networks, which do not need probability information. We apply this method to the Keepaway task from RoboCup simulated soccer and compare the result from automated transfer to that from handcoded transfer.|Yaxin Liu,Peter Stone","66222|AAAI|2007|Scaling Up Solving POMDPs through Value Based Clustering|Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide an appropriately rich model for agents operating under partial knowledge of the environment. Since finding an optimal POMDP policy is intractable, approximation techniques have been a main focus of research, among them point-based algorithms, which scale up relatively well - up to thousands of states. An important decision in a point-based algorithm is the order of backup operations over belief states. Prioritization techniques for ordering the sequence of backup operations reduce the number of needed backups considerably, but involve significant overhead. This paper suggests a new way to order backups, based on a soft clustering of the belief space. Our novel soft clustering method relies on the solution of the underlying MDP.

The optimal actions can now depend on the total reward that has been accumulated so far in addition to the current state. We extend our previous work on functional value iteration from one-switch utility functions to all utility functions that can be approximated with piecewise linear utility functions (with and without exponential tails) by using functional value iteration to find a plan that maximizes the expected total utility for the approximate utility function. Functional value iteration does not maintain a value for every state but a value function that maps the total reward that has been accumulated so far into a value. We describe how functional value iteration represents these value functions in finite form, how it performs dynamic programming by manipulating these representations and what kinds of approximation guarantees it is able to make. We also apply it to a probabilistic blocksworld problem, a standard test domain for decision-theoretic planners.|Yaxin Liu,Sven Koenig"]]}}
