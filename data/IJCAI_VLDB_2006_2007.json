Schema mappings are fundamental components for both data exchange and data integration. To date, a language for specifying (or programming) schema mappings exists. However, developmental support for programming schema mappings is still lacking. In particular, a tool for debugging schema mappings has not yet been developed. In this paper, we propose to build a debugger for understanding and exploring schema mappings. We present a primary feature of our debugger, called routes, that describes the relationship between source and target data with the schema mapping. We present two algorithms for computing all routes or one route for selected target data. Both algorithms execute in polynomial time in the size of the input. In computing all routes, our algorithm produces a concise representation that factors common steps in the routes. Furthermore, every minimal route for the selected data can, essentially, be found in this representation. Our second algorithm is able to produce one route fast, if there is one, and alternative routes as needed. We demonstrate the feasibility of our route algorithms through a set of experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets.|Laura Chiticariu,Wang Chiew Tan","16779|IJCAI|2007|From Answer Set Logic Programming to Circumscription via Logic of GK|We first provide a mapping from Pearce's equilibrium logic and Ferraris's general logic programs to Lin and Shoham's logic of knowledge and justified assumptions, a nonmonotonic modal logic that has been shown to include as special cases both Reiter's default logic in the propositional case and Moore's autoepistemic logic. From this mapping, we obtain a mapping from general logic programs to circumscription, both in the propositional and first-order case. Furthermore, we show that this mapping can be used to check the strong equivalence between two propositional logic programs in classical logic.|Fangzhen Lin,Yi Zhou","80647|VLDB|2006|Nested Mappings Schema Mapping Reloaded|Many problems in information integration rely on specifications, called schema mappings, that model the relationships between schemas. Schema mappings for both relational and nested data are well-known. In this work, we present a new formalism for schema mapping that extends these existing formalisms in two significant ways. First, our nested mappings allow for nesting and correlation of mappings. This results in a natural programming paradigm that often yields more accurate specifications. In particular, we show that nested mappings can naturally preserve correlations among data that existing mapping formalisms cannot. We also show that using nested mappings for purposes of exchanging data from a source to a target will result in less redundancy in the target data. The second extension to the mapping formalism is the ability to express, in a declarative way, grouping and data merging semantics. This semantics can be easily changed and customized to the integration task at hand. We present a new algorithm for the automatic generation of nested mappings from schema matchings (that is, simple element-to-element correspondences between schemas). We have implemented this algorithm, along with algorithms for the generation of transformation queries (e.g., XQuery) based on the nested mapping specification. We show that the generation algorithms scale well to large, highly nested schemas. We also show that using nested mappings in data exchange can drastically reduce the execution cost of producing a target instance, particularly over large data sources, and can also dramatically improve the quality of the generated data.|Ariel Fuxman,Mauricio A.

They either cast rules into classical logic or limit the interaction between rules and ontologies. Autoepistemic logic (AEL) is an attractive formalismwhich allows to overcome these limitations, by serving as a uniform host language to embed ontologies and nonmonotonic logic programs into it. For the latter, so far only the propositional setting has been considered. In this paper, we present several embeddings of normal and disjunctive non-ground logic programs under the stable-model semantics into first-order AEL, and compare them in combination with classical theories, with respect to stable expansions and autoepistemic consequences. Our results reveal differences and correspondences of the embeddings and provide a useful guidance in the choice of a particular embedding for knowledge combination.|Jos de Bruijn,Thomas Eiter,Axel Polleres,Hans Tompits","80620|VLDB|2006|Putting Context into Schema Matching|Attribute-level schema matching has proven to be an important first step in developing mappings for data exchange, integration, restructuring and schema evolution. In this paper we investigate contextual schema matching, in which selection conditions are associated with matches by the schema matching process in order to improve overall match quality. We define a general space of matching techniques, and within this framework we identify a variety of novel, concrete algorithms for contextual schema matching. Furthermore, we show how common schema mapping techniques can be generalized to take more effective advantage of contextual matches, enabling automatic construction of mappings across certain forms of schema heterogeneity. An experimental study examines a wide variety of quality and performance issues. In addition, it demonstrates that contextual schema matching is an effective and practical technique to further automate the definition of complex data transformations.|Philip Bohannon,Eiman Elnahrawy,Wenfei Fan,Michael Flaster","16512|IJCAI|2007|Collaborative Inductive Logic Programming for Path Planning|In distributed systems, learning does not necessarily involve the participation of agents directly in the inductive process itself. Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

In this paper, we investigate some important properties of epistemic logic programs. In particular, we show that Lee and Lifschitz's result on loop formulas for disjunctive logic programs can be extended to a special class of epistemic logic programs. We also study the polysize model property for epistemic logic programs. Based on these discoveries, we identify two non-trivial classes of epistemic logic programs whose consistency checking complexity is reduced from PSPACE-complete to NP-complete and P -complete respectively. We observe that many important applications on epistemic representation fall into these two classes of epistemic logic programs.|Yan Zhang"],["80738|VLDB|2007|Indexable PLA for Efficient Similarity Search|Similarity-based search over time-series databases has been a hot research topic for a long history, which is widely used in many applications, including multimedia retrieval, data mining, web search and retrieval, and so on. However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) of the time series, the similarity search over directly indexed time series usually encounters a serious problem, known as the \"dimensionality curse\". Thus, many dimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing the dimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods, only Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries, which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initial studies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods, however, show that PLA performs no worse than others. Motivated by this, in this paper, we re-investigate PLA for approximating and indexing time series. Specifically, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced PLA-space, and prove that this function indeed results in a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original time series, which can lead to no false dismissals during the similarity search. As a second step, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds to improve the search efficiency. Our extensive experiments over a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data sets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of PLA together with the newly proposed lower bound distance, in terms of both pruning power and wall clock time, compared with two state-of-the-art reduction methods, Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA) and Chebyshev Polynomials (CP).|Qiuxia Chen,Lei Chen 0002,Xiang Lian,Yunhao Liu,Jeffrey Xu Yu","80730|VLDB|2007|Probabilistic Graphical Models and their Role in Databases|Probabilistic graphical models provide a framework for compact representation and efficient reasoning about the joint probability distribution of several interdependent variables. This is a classical topic with roots in statistical physics.

Techniques from graphical models have also been applied to many topics directly of interest to the database community including information extraction, sensor data analysis, imprecise data representation and querying, selectivity estimation for query optimization, and data privacy. As database research continues to expand beyond the confines of traditional enterprise domains, we expect both the need and applicability of probabilistic graphical models to increase dramatically over the next few years. With this tutorial, we are aiming to provide a foundational overview of probabilistic graphical models to the database community, accompanied by a brief overview of some of the recent research literature on the role of graphical models in databases.|Amol Deshpande,Sunita Sarawagi","80761|VLDB|2007|Computer Science  A New World of Data Management|Data management, one of the most successful software technologies, is the bedrock of almost all business, government, and scientific activities, worldwide. Data management continues to grow, more than doubling in data and transaction volumes every two years with a growth in deployments to fuel a $ billion market. A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications.

In the 's data under DBMS management reached % of the world's data. The six-fold growth of non-relational data in the period -- will reduce that number to well below %.

Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities. Missing this opportunity will be worse than missing the Internet.

However, traditional information retrieval techniques are likely to be expensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized. Our performance evaluation using the INEX data set in the Quark  open-source XML database system indicates that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient.|Feng Shao,Lin Guo,Chavdar Botev,Anand Bhaskar,Muthiah Chettiar,Fan Yang 0002,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram","80797|VLDB|2007|SOR A Practical System for Ontology Storage Reasoning and Search|Ontology, an explicit specification of shared conceptualization, has been increasingly used to define formal data semantics and improve data reusability and interoperability in enterprise information systems.

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input.

We show that unlike standard on-line systems, scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will be different than policies that optimize for average slowdown which is more appropriate metric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. We also propose a hybrid scheduling policy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness. We further discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploit sharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs.

Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature. We show that, even for queries over meta-information together with data, this problem is decidable for non-recursive conjunctive queries.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs.

This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","16649|IJCAI|2007|Dynamic Verification of Trust in Distributed Open Systems|In open and distributed systems, agents must engage in interactions of which they have no previous experience.

Domain knowledge about the conditional independence relationships among variables can help learning of the Bayesian Network structure.

One approach to achieve required sensing coverage is to use robots to convey sensors within this space. Planning the motion of these robots - coordinating their paths in order to maximize the amount of information collected while placing bounds on their resources (e.g., path length or energy capacity) - is aNP-hard problem. In this paper, we present an efficient path planning algorithm that coordinates multiple robots, each having a resource constraint, to maximize the \"informativeness\" of their visited locations. In particular, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to characterize the amount of information collected. We provide strong theoretical approximation guarantees for our algorithm by exploiting the submodularity property of mutual information. In addition, we improve the efficiency of our approach by extending the algorithm using branch and bound and a region-based decomposition of the space. We provide an extensive empirical analysis of our algorithm, comparing with existing heuristics on datasets from several real world sensing applications.|Amarjeet Singh 0003,Andreas Krause,Carlos Guestrin,William J.

In this general setting where the model is (perhaps only slightly) mis-specified, monitoring (and consequently planning) may be impossible as errors might accumulate over time. We provide a new characterization, the value of observation, which allows us to bound the error accumulation. The value of observation is a parameter that governs how much information the observation provides. For instance, in Partially Observable MDPs when it is  the POMDP is an MDP while for an unobservable Markov Decision Process the parameter is . Thus, the new parameter characterizes a spectrum from MDPs to unobservable MDPs depending on the amount of information conveyed in the observations.|Eyal Even-Dar,Sham M.

Given a topological (RCC) constraint network and a directional constraint network, we ask when the joint network is satisfiable. We show that when the topological network is over one of the three maximal tractable subclasses of RCC, the problem can be reduced into satisfiability problems in the RCC algebra and the rectangle algebra (RA). Therefore, reasoning techniques developed for RCC and RA can be used to solve the satisfiability problem of a joint network.|Sanjiang Li","16791|IJCAI|2007|PC-DPOP A New Partial Centralization Algorithm for Distributed Optimization|Fully decentralized algorithms for distributed constraint optimization often require excessive amounts of communication when applied to complex problems.

PC-DPOP provides better control over what parts of the problem are centralized and allows this centralization to be optimal with respect to the chosen communication structure. Unlike OptAPO, PC-DPOP allows for a priory, exact predictions about privacy loss, communication, memory and computational requirements on all nodes and links in the network. Upper bounds on communication and memory requirements can be specified.

To the best of our knowledge, this was an open problem. A previous algorithm for a domain that includes also disconnected regions works in O(n), but, for the problem we consider here, such an algorithm cannot be used. Using the new algorithm we also show that the problem of deciding the consistency of a network of disjunctive cardinal constraints with variables ranging over the set of connected regions is NP-Complete.

Although a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to modeling uncertain data and answering some types of queries on uncertain data, how to conduct advanced analysis on uncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this paper, we tackle the problem of skyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all the objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p. Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop two efficient algorithms. The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.|Jian Pei,Bin Jiang,Xuemin Lin,Yidong Yuan","80739|VLDB|2007|VGRAM Improving Performance of Approximate Queries on String Collections Using Variable-Length Grams|Many applications need to solve the following problem of approximate string matching from a collection of strings, how to find those similar to a given string, or the strings in another (possibly the same) collection of strings Many algorithms are developed using fixed-length grams, which are substrings of a string used as signatures to identify similar strings.

The increasing popularity of this query paradigm has led to the introduction of specialized rank join operators that integrate the selection of top tuples with join processing. These operators access just \"enough\" of the input in order to generate just \"enough\" output and can offer significant speed-ups for query evaluation. The number of input tuples that an operator accesses is called the input depth of the operator, and this is the driving cost factor in rank join processing. This introduces the important problem of depth estimation, which is crucial for the costing of rank join operators during query compilation and thus for their integration in optimized physical plans. We introduce an estimation methodology, termed Deep, for approximating the input depths of rank join operators in a physical execution plan. At the core of Deep lies a general, principled framework that formalizes depth computation in terms of the joint distribution of scores in the base tables. This framework results in a systematic estimation methodology that takes the characteristics of the data directly into account and thus enables more accurate estimates. We develop novel estimation algorithms that provide an efficient realization of the formal Deep framework, and describe their integration on top of the statistics module of an existing query optimizer. We validate the performance of Deep with an extensive experimental study on data sets of varying characteristics. The results verify the effectiveness of Deep as an estimation method and demonstrate its advantages over previously proposed techniques.|Karl Schnaitter,Joshua Spiegel,Neoklis Polyzotis","16721|IJCAI|2007|Learning Question Paraphrases for QA from Encarta Logs|Question paraphrasing is critical in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, especially for question reformulation in question answering (QA).

Summarizing a collection of subsets of a large dataset, by computing a measure for each subset in the (typically, user-specified) collection is a fundamental problem. The multidimensional data model, which treats records as points in a space defined by dimension attributes, offers a natural space of data subsets to be considered as summarization candidates, and traditional SQL and OLAP constructs, such as GROUP BY and CUBE, allow us to compute measures for subsets drawn from this space. However, GROUP BY only allows us to summarize a limited collection of subsets, and CUBE summarizes all subsets in this space. Further, they restrict the measure used to summarize a data subset to be a one-step aggregation, using functions such as SUM, of field-values in the data records.In this paper, we introduce composite subset measures, computed by aggregating not only data records but also the measures of other related subsets. We allow summarization of naturally related regions in the multidimensional space, offering more flexibility than either GROUP BY or CUBE in the choice of what data subsets to summarize. Thus, our framework allows more meaningful summaries to be computed for a targeted collection of data subsets.We propose an algebra called AW-RA and an equivalent pictorial language called aggregation workflows. Aggregation workflows allow for intuitive expression of composite measure queries, and the underlying algebra is designed to facilitate efficient multiscan execution. We describe an evaluation framework based on multiple passes of sorting and scanning over the original dataset. In each pass, several measures are evaluated simultaneously, and dependencies between these measures and containment relationships between the underlying subsets of data are orchestrated to reduce the memory footprint of the computation.

It is critical for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), and Machine Translation (MT).

However, most of the existing researches focus on constructing paraphrase corpora, in which little contextual constraints for paraphrase application are imposed. This paper presents a method that automatically acquires context-specific lexical paraphrases. In this method, the obtained paraphrases of a word depend on the specific sentence the word occurs in. Two stages are included, i.e. candidate paraphrase extraction and paraphrase validation, both of which are mainly based on web mining.

Redundantly stored information can lead not just to a higher data storage cost, but also to increased costs for data transfer and data manipulation. Furthermore, such data redundancies can lead to potential update anomalies, rendering the database inconsistent.One way to avoid data redundancies is to employ good schema design based on known functional dependencies. In fact, several recent studies have focused on defining the notion of XML Functional Dependencies (XML FDs) to capture XML data redundancies. We observe further that XML databases are often \"casually designed\" and XML FDs may not be determined in advance. Under such circumstances, discovering XML data redundancies (in terms of FDs) from the data itself becomes necessary and is an integral part of the schema refinement process.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first system, DiscoverXFD, for effcient discovery of XML data redundancies.

As a consequence, we can propose a group of protocols which won this practical contest under identical conditions.|Michael Peter Haustein,Theo Härder,Konstantin Luttenberger","80841|VLDB|2007|K-Anonymization as Spatial Indexing Toward Scalable and Incremental Anonymization|In this paper we observe that k-anonymizing a data set is strikingly similar to building a spatial index over the data set, so similar in fact that classical spatial indexing techniques can be used to anonymize data sets. We use this observation to leverage over  years of work on database indexing to provide efficient and dynamic anonymization techniques. Experiments with our implementation show that the R-tree index-based approach yields a batch anonymization algorithm that is orders of magnitude more efficient than previously proposed algorithms and has the advantage of supporting incremental updates. Finally, we show that the anonymizations generated by the R-tree approach do not sacrifice quality in their search for efficiency in fact, by several previously proposed quality metrics, the compact partitioning properties of R-trees generate anonymizations superior to those generated by previously proposed anonymization algorithms.|Tochukwu Iwuchukwu,Jeffrey F. Naughton","80619|VLDB|2006|Type-Based XML Projection|XML data projection (or pruning) is one of the main optimization techniques recently adopted in the context of main-memory XML query-engines. The underlying idea is quite simple given a query Q over a document D, the subtrees of D not necessary to evaluate Q are pruned, thus obtaining a smaller document D'. Then Q is executed over D', hence avoiding to allocate and process nodes that will never be reached by navigational specifications in Q.In this article, we propose a new approach, based on types, that greatly improves current solutions. Besides providing comparable or greater precision and far lesser pruning overhead our solution, unlike current approaches, takes into account backward axes, predicates, and can be applied to multiple queries rather than just to single ones. A side contribution is a new type system for XPath able to handle backward axes, which we devise in order to apply our solution.The soundness of our approach is formally proved. Furthermore, we prove that the approach is also complete (i.e., yields the best possible type-driven pruning) for a relevant class of queries and DTDs, which include nearly all the queries used in the XMark and XPathMark benchmarks. These benchmarks are also used to test our implementation and show and gauge the practical benefits of our solution.|Véronique Benzaken,Giuseppe Castagna,Dario Colazzo,Kim Nguyen"],["80731|VLDB|2007|DataScope Viewing Database Contents in Google Maps Way|People have been relying on Google Maps, MapQuest, or other similar services to find desired locations on maps, browse surrounding businesses, get driving directions, etc..

For ambiguous queries, a traditional approach is to organize search results into groups (clusters), one for each meaning of the query. These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate. Combined with a content-driven Web page clustering technique, our heuristic search system significantly improves the clustering results.|Ron Bekkerman,Shlomo Zilberstein,James Allan","16443|IJCAI|2007|Improving Author Coreference by Resource-Bounded Information Gathering from the Web|Accurate entity resolution is sometimes impossible simply due to insufficient information.

We formulate the coreference problem as one of graph partitioning with discriminatively-trained edge weights, and then incorporate web information either as additional features or as additional nodes in the graph. Since the web is too large to incorporate all its data, we need an efficient procedure for selecting a subset of web queries and data.

Such authority analyses also apply to hot \"Web .\" applications that exhibit a natural graph structure, such as social networks (e.g., MySpace, Facebook) or tagging communities (e.g., Flickr, Del.icio.us). Finding the most trustworthy or most important authorities in such a community is a pressing need, given the huge scale and also the anonymity of social networks. Computing global authority measures in a Peer-to-Peer (PP) collaboration of autonomous peers is a hot research topic, in particular because of the incomplete local knowledge of the peers, which typically only know about (arbitrarily overlapping) sub-graphs of the complete graph. We demonstrate a self-organizing PP collaboration that, based on the local sub-graphs, efficiently computes global authority scores. In hand with the loosely-coupled spirit of a PP system, the computation is carried out in a completely asynchronous manner without any central knowledge or coordinating instance.

Whereas social laws need to be enforced in a top-down manner, norms evolve in a bottom-up manner and are typically more self-enforcing. While effective norms can significantly enhance performance of individual agents and agent societies, there has been little work in multiagent systems on the formation of social norms. We propose a model that supports the emergence of social norms via learning from interaction experiences. In our model, individual agents repeatedly interact with other agents in the society over instances of a given scenario. Each interaction is framed as a stage game. An agent learns its policy to play the game over repeated interactions with multiple agents. We term this mode of learning social learning, which is distinct from an agent learning from repeated interactions against the same player. We are particularly interested in situations where multiple action combinations yield the same optimal payoff. The key research question is to find out if the entire population learns to converge to a consistent norm. In addition to studying such emergence of social norms among homogeneous learners via social learning, we study the effects of heterogeneous learners, population size, multiple social groups, etc.|Sandip Sen,Stéphane Airiau","16720|IJCAI|2007|Case-based Learning from Proactive Communication|We present a proactive communication approach that allows CBR agents to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other CBR agents.

It has been shown in the literature that the point of convergence and motion of a swarm of autonomous mobile agents can be controlled by using cyclic pursuit laws. In cyclic pursuit, there exists a predefined cyclic connection between agents and each agent pursues the next agent in the cycle. In this paper we generalize this idea to a case where an agent pursues a point which is the weighted average of the positions of the remaining agents. This point correspond to a particular pursuit sequence. Using this concept of centroidal cyclic pursuit, the behavior of the agents is analyzed such that, by suitably selecting the agents' gain, the rendezvous point of the agents can be controlled, directed linear motion of the agents can be achieved, and the trajectories of the agents can be changed by switching between the pursuit sequences keeping some of the behaviors of the agents invariant.

In this paper we provide a technique for accomplishing this objective. Our technique can deal with a rich class of preferences, including so-called temporally extended preferences (TEPs). Unlike simple preferences which express desired properties of the final state achieved by a plan, TEPs can express desired properties of the entire sequence of states traversed by a plan, allowing the user to express a much richer set of preferences. Our technique involves converting a planning problem with TEPs into an equivalent planning problem containing only simple preferences. This conversion is accomplished by augmenting the inputed planning domain with a new set of predicates and actions for updating these predicates. We then provide a collection of new heuristics and a specialized search algorithm that can guide the planner towards preferred plans. Under some fairly general conditions our method is able to find a most preferred plan-i.e., an optimal plan. It can accomplish this without having to resort to admissible heuristics, which often perform poorly in practice. Nor does our technique require an assumption of restricted plan length or make-span. We have implemented our approach in the HPlan-P planning system and used it to compete in the th International Planning Competition, where it achieved distinguished performance in the Qualitative Preferences track.|Jorge A.

In many domains, the resulting plan can be expressed using relatively few macros, making it possible to generate exponential length plans in polynomial time.

Iterative macros exhibit both the potential advantages (e.g., travel fast towards goal) and the potential limitations (e.g., utility problem) of classical macros, only on a much larger scale. A family of techniques are introduced to balance this trade-off in favor of faster planning.

Assuming a setting where the index updates need not be written to disk immediately, we propose an R-tree-based indexing technique that does not exhibit any of these drawbacks. This technique exploits the buffering of update operations in main memory as well as the grouping of operations to reduce disk IO. In particular, operations are performed in bulk so that multiple operations are able to share IO. The paper presents an analytical cost model that is shown to be accurate by empirical studies. The studies also show that, in terms of update IO performance, the proposed technique improves on state of the art in settings with frequent updates.|Laurynas Biveinis,Simonas Saltenis,Christian S.

We consider a very relaxed notion of partial ordering and show how planning for LTL goals (without the next-time operator) can be translated into a SAT problem and solved very efficiently.

Machine learning (ML) provides several techniques for automatically acquiring those heuristics. Usually, a planner solves a problem, and a ML technique generates knowledge from the search episode in terms of complete plans (macro-operators or cases), or heuristics (also named control knowledge in planning). In this paper, we present a novel way of generating planning heuristics we learn heuristics in one planner and transfer them to another planner. This approach is based on the fact that different planners employ different search bias. We want to extract knowledge from the search performed by one planner and use the learned knowledge on another planner that uses a different search bias. The goal is to improve the efficiency of the second planner by capturing regularities of the domain that it would not capture by itself due to its bias. We employ a deductive learning method (EBL) that is able to automatically acquire control knowledge by generating bounded explanations of the problem-solving episodes in a Graphplan-based planner. Then, we transform the learned knowledge so that it can be used by a bidirectional planner.|Susana Fernández,Ricardo Aler,Daniel Borrajo","16650|IJCAI|2007|When is Temporal Planning Really Temporal|While even STRIPS planners must search for plans of unbounded length, temporal planners must also cope with the fact that actions may start at any point in time. Most temporal planners cope with this challenge by restricting action start times to a small set of decision epochs, because this enables search to be carried out in state-space and leverages powerful state-based reachability heuristics, originally developed for classical planning. Indeed, decision-epoch planners won the International Planning Competition's Temporal Planning Track in ,  and .

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

F-logic has generated considerable interest commercially, in the academia, and within various standardization efforts as a means for building ontologies and for reasoning on the Semantic Web. Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature. We show that, even for queries over meta-information together with data, this problem is decidable for non-recursive conjunctive queries. We also provide relevant complexity results.|Andrea Calì,Michael Kifer","16512|IJCAI|2007|Collaborative Inductive Logic Programming for Path Planning|In distributed systems, learning does not necessarily involve the participation of agents directly in the inductive process itself. Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

Behaviors are represented with a sort of nondeterministic transition systems, whose transitions are conditioned on the current state of the environment, also represented as a nondeterministic finite transition system. On the other hand, the target behavior is assumed to be fully deterministic and stands for the behavior that the system as a whole needs to guarantee. We formally define the problem within an abstract framework, characterize its computational complexity, and propose a solution by appealing to satisfiability in Propositional Dynamic Logic, which is indeed optimal with respect to computational complexity. We claim that this problem, while novel to the best of our knowledge, can be instantiated to multiple specific settings in different contexts and can thus be linked to different research areas of AI, including agent-oriented programming and cognitive robotics, control, multi-agent coordination, plan integration, and automatic web-service composition.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Sebastian Sardiña","16759|IJCAI|2007|Using Linear Programming for Bayesian Exploration in Markov Decision Processes|A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge. Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming. We illustrate this approach on a few domains and compare it with other exploration algorithms.|Pablo Samuel Castro,Doina Precup","16723|IJCAI|2007|Generalized Additive Bayesian Network Classifiers|Bayesian network classifiers (BNC) have received considerable attention in machine learning field.

In this paper, we propose a generalized additive Bayesian network classifiers, which transfers the structure learning problem to a generalized additive models (GAM) learning problem. We first generate a series of very simple BNs, and put them in the framework of GAM, then adopt a gradient-based algorithm to learn the combining parameters, and thus construct a more powerful classifier.

They formulate a search problem as the problem of model expansion (MX), which is the problem of expanding a given structure with new relations so that it satisfies a given formula. Their long-term goal is to produce practical tools to solve combinatorial search problems, especially those in NP. In this framework, a problem is encoded in a logic, an instance of the problem is represented by a finite structure, and a solver generates solutions to the problem. This approach relies on propositionalisation of high-level specifications, and on the efficiency of modern SAT solvers. Here, we propose an efficient algorithm which combines grounding with partial evaluation. Since the MX framework is based on classical logic, we are able to take advantage of known results for the so-called guarded fragments. In the case of k-guarded formulas with inductive definitions under a natural restriction, the algorithm performs much better than naive grounding by relying on connections between k-guarded formulas and tree decompositions.|Murray Patterson,Yongmei Liu,Eugenia Ternovska,Arvind Gupta","16503|IJCAI|2007|Reducing Accidental Complexity in Planning Problems|Although even propositional STRIPS planning is a hard problem in general, many instances of the problem, including many of those commonly used as benchmarks, are easy.

We investigate the use of automatic problem transformations to reduce this \"accidental\" problem complexity. The main tool is abstraction we identify a new, weaker, condition under which abstraction is \"safe\", in the sense that any solution to the abstracted problem can be refined to a concrete solution (in polynomial time, for most cases) and also show how different kinds of problem reformulations can be applied to create greater opportunities for such safe abstraction.|Patrik Haslum","16535|IJCAI|2007|Combining Topological and Directional Information for Spatial Reasoning|Current research on qualitative spatial representation and reasoning usually focuses on one single aspect of space.

Additionally, LTL formulae can be used to represent domain-specific control knowledge to speed up planning. In this paper we extend SATbased planning for LTL goals (akin to bounded LTL model-checking in verification) to partially ordered plans, thus significantly increasing planning efficiency compared to purely sequential SAT planning. We consider a very relaxed notion of partial ordering and show how planning for LTL goals (without the next-time operator) can be translated into a SAT problem and solved very efficiently. The results extend the practical applicability of SATbased planning to a wider class of planning problems. In addition, they could be applied to solving problems in bounded LTL model-checking more efficiently.|Robert Mattmüller,Jussi Rintanen","16733|IJCAI|2007|Planning with Goal Utility Dependencies|Work in partial satisfaction planning (PSP) has hitherto assumed that goals are independent thus implying that they have additive utility values.

We provide a framework for representing them using the General Additive Independence model and investigate two different approaches to handle this problem () compiling PSP with utility dependencies to Integer Programming () extending forward heuristic search planning to handle PSP goal dependencies. To guide the forward planning search, we introduce a novel heuristic framework that combines costpropagation and Integer Programming to select beneficial goals to find an informative heuristic estimate. The two implemented planners, iPUD and SPUDS, using the approaches discussed above, are compared empirically on several benchmark domains. While iPUD is more readily amendable to handle goal utility dependencies and can provide bounded optimality guarantees, SPUDS scales much better.|Minh Binh Do,J.

We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical NBA players\", the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players\", the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries.

One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

Top-k queries operate on index lists for a query's elementary conditions and aggregate scores for result candidates. One of the best implementation methods in this setting is the family of threshold algorithms, which aim to terminate the index scans as early as possible based on lower and upper bounds for the final scores of result candidates. This procedure performs sequential disk accesses for sorted index scans, but also has the option of performing random accesses to resolve score uncertainty. This entails scheduling for the two kinds of accesses ) the prioritization of different index lists in the sequential accesses, and ) the decision on when to perform random accesses and for which candidates.The prior literature has studied some of these scheduling issues, but only for each of the two access types in isolation. The current paper takes an integrated view of the scheduling issues and develops novel strategies that outperform prior proposals by a large margin. Our main contributions are new, principled, scheduling methods based on a Knapsack-related optimization for sequential accesses and a cost model for random accesses. The methods can be further boosted by harnessing probabilistic estimators for scores, selectivities, and index list correlations. In performance experiments with three different datasets (TREC Terabyte, HTTP server logs, and IMDB), our methods achieved significant performance gains compared to the best previously known methods.|Holger Bast,Debapriyo Majumdar,Ralf Schenkel,Martin Theobald,Gerhard Weikum","80854|VLDB|2007|Sum-Max Monotonic Ranked Joins for Evaluating Top-K Twig Queries on Weighted Data Graphs|In many applications, the underlying data (the web, an XML document, or a relational database) can be seen as a graph. These graphs may be enriched with weights, associated with the nodes and edges of the graph, denoting application specific desirabilitypenalty assessments, such as popularity, trust, or cost. A particular challenge when considering such weights in query processing is that results need to be ranked accordingly. Answering keyword-based queries on weighted graphs is shown to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we first show that answering queries with further structure imposed on them remains NP-hard. We next show that, while the query evaluation task can be viewed in terms of ranked structural-joins along query axes, the monotonicity property, necessary for ranked join algorithms, is violated. Consequently, traditional ranked join algorithms are not directly applicable. Thus, we establish an alternative, sum-max monotonicity property and show how to leverage this for developing a self-punctuating, horizon-based ranked join (HR-Join) operator for ranked twig-query execution on data graphs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation schemes and the HR-join operator for merging ranked sub-results under sum-max monotonicity.|Yan Qi 0002,K.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16719|IJCAI|2007|Average-Reward Decentralized Markov Decision Processes|Formal analysis of decentralized decision making has become a thriving research area in recent years, producing a number of multi-agent extensions of Markov decision processes.

Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space.

These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy.

Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming. We illustrate this approach on a few domains and compare it with other exploration algorithms.|Pablo Samuel Castro,Doina Precup"],["16533|IJCAI|2007|Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning|Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is the problem of learning the reward function underlying a Markov Decision Process given the dynamics of the system and the behaviour of an expert.

We extend the Probably Approximately Correct semantics to the case of learning from partial observations with arbitrarily hidden attributes. We establish that simply requiring learned hypotheses to be consistent with observed values suffices to guarantee that hidden values are recoverable to a certain accuracy we also show that, in some sense, this is an optimal strategy for achieving accurate recovery. We then establish that a number of natural concept classes, including all the classes of monotone formulas that are PAC learnable by monotone formulas, and the classes of conjunctions, disjunctions, k-CNF, k-DNF, and linear thresholds, are consistently learnable from partial observations. We finally show that the concept classes of parities and monotone term -decision lists are not properly consistently learnable from partial observations, if RP  NP.

Agent-space options can be reused in later tasks that share the same agent-space but have different problem-spaces.

The controlled pathway, which includes the prefrontal cortex, is seen as acquiring declarative representations of skills. In comparison, the automatic pathway is thought to develop procedural representations. Automaticity in motor skill learning involves a reduction in dependence on frontal systems and an increased reliance on the automatic pathway.

Contrary to earlier algorithms which only move vehicles to known customers, this paper investigates waiting and relocation strategies in which vehicles may wait at their current location or relocate to arbitrary sites. Experimental results show that waiting and relocation strategies may dramatically improve customer service, especially for problems that are highly dynamic and contain many late requests. The decisions to wait and to relocate do not exploit any problem-specific features but rather are obtained by including choices in the online algorithm that are necessarily sub-optimal in an offline setting.|Russell Bent,Pascal Van Hentenryck","16556|IJCAI|2007|Conflict-Based Diagnosis Adding Uncertainty to Model-based Diagnosis|Consistency-based diagnosis concerns using a model of the structure and behaviour of a system in order to analyse whether or not the system is malfunctioning. A well-known limitation of consistency-based diagnosis is that it is unable to cope with uncertainty. Uncertainty reasoning is nowadays done using Bayesian networks. In this field, a conflict measure has been introduced to detect conflicts between a given probability distribution and associated data. In this paper, we use a probabilistic theory to represent logical diagnostic systems and show that in this theory we are able to determine consistent and inconsistent states as traditionally done in consistency-based diagnosis. Furthermore, we analyse how the conflict measure in this theory offers a way to favour particular diagnoses above others. This enables us to add uncertainty reasoning to consistency-based diagnosis in a seamless fashion.|Ildikó Flesch,Peter J. F.

Data encryption is the main technique for achieving security. While in the past enterprises were hesitant to implement database encryption because of the very high cost, complexity, and performance degradation, they now have to face the ever-growing risk of data theft as well as emerging legislative requirements. Data encryption can be done at multiple tiers within the enterprise. Different choices on where to encrypt the data offer different security features that protect against different attacks. One class of attack that needs to be taken seriously is the compromise of the database server, its software or administrator. A secure way to address this threat is for a DBMS to directly process queries on the ciphertext, without decryption. We conduct a comprehensive study on answering SUM and AVG aggregation queries in such a system model by using a secure homomorphic encryption scheme in a novel way. We demonstrate that the performance of such a solution is comparable to a traditional symmetric encryption scheme (e.g., DES) in which each value is decrypted and the computation is performed on the plaintext. Clearly this traditional encryption scheme is not a viable solution to the problem because the server must have access to the secret key and the plaintext, which violates our system model and security requirements. We study the problem in the setting of a read-optimized DBMS for data warehousing applications, in which SUM and AVG are frequent and crucial.|Tingjian Ge,Stanley B.

However, this model is not suitable for processing concurrent distributed queries because the foundation, the memory-disk hierarchy, does not exist for data provided by remote sources. Therefore, the query engine cannot exploit any data sharing so that each process will have to interact with data sources independently issue data requests and fetch data over the network. This paper presents Request Window, a novel DQP mechanism that can detect and employ data sharing opportunities across concurrent distributed queries. By combining multiple similar data requests issued to the same data source to a common data request, Request Window allows concurrent query executing processes to share the common result data. With the benefits of reduced source burdens and data transfers, the throughput of query engine can be significantly improved. This paper also introduces the IGNITE system, an extended PostgreSQL with DQP support.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

The increasing popularity of this query paradigm has led to the introduction of specialized rank join operators that integrate the selection of top tuples with join processing. These operators access just \"enough\" of the input in order to generate just \"enough\" output and can offer significant speed-ups for query evaluation. The number of input tuples that an operator accesses is called the input depth of the operator, and this is the driving cost factor in rank join processing. This introduces the important problem of depth estimation, which is crucial for the costing of rank join operators during query compilation and thus for their integration in optimized physical plans. We introduce an estimation methodology, termed Deep, for approximating the input depths of rank join operators in a physical execution plan. At the core of Deep lies a general, principled framework that formalizes depth computation in terms of the joint distribution of scores in the base tables. This framework results in a systematic estimation methodology that takes the characteristics of the data directly into account and thus enables more accurate estimates. We develop novel estimation algorithms that provide an efficient realization of the formal Deep framework, and describe their integration on top of the statistics module of an existing query optimizer. We validate the performance of Deep with an extensive experimental study on data sets of varying characteristics. The results verify the effectiveness of Deep as an estimation method and demonstrate its advantages over previously proposed techniques.|Karl Schnaitter,Joshua Spiegel,Neoklis Polyzotis","80623|VLDB|2006|Using Partial Evaluation in Distributed Query Evaluation|A basic idea in parallel query processing is that one is prepared to do more computation than strictly necessary at individual sites in order to reduce the elapsed time, the network traffic, or both in the evaluation of the query. We develop this idea for the evaluation of boolean XPath queries over a tree that is fragmented, both horizontally and vertically over a number of sites. The key idea is to send the whole query to each site which partially evaluates, in parallel, the query and sends the results as compact boolean functions to a coordinator which combines these to obtain the result. This approach has several advantages. First, each site is visited only once, even if several fragments of the tree are stored at that site. Second, no prior constraints on how the tree is decomposed are needed, nor is any structural information about the tree required, such as a DTD. Third, there is a satisfactory bound on the total computation performed on all sites and on the total network traffic. We also develop a simple incremental maintenance algorithm that requires communication only with the sites at which changes have taken place moreover the network traffic depends neither on the data nor on the update. These results, we believe, illustrate the usefulness and potential of partial evaluation in distributed systems as well as centralized xml stores for evaluating XPath queries and beyond.|Peter Buneman,Gao Cong,Wenfei Fan,Anastasios Kementsietsidis","80767|VLDB|2007|Materialized Views in Probabilistic Databases for Information Exchange and Query Optimization|Views over probabilistic data contain correlations between tuples, and the current approach is to capture these correlations using explicit lineage. In this paper we propose an alternative approach to materializing probabilistic views, by giving conditions under which a view can be represented by a block-independent disjoint (BID) table. Not all views can be represented as BID tables and so we propose a novel partial representation that can represent all views but may not define a unique probability distribution. We then give conditions on when a query's value on a partial representation will be uniquely defined. We apply our theory to two applications query processing using views and information exchange using views. In query processing on probabilistic data, we can ignore the lineage and use materialized views to more efficiently answer queries. By contrast, if the view has explicit lineage, the query evaluation must reprocess the lineage to compute the query resulting in dramatically slower execution. The second application is information exchange when we do not wish to disclose the entire lineage, which otherwise may result in shipping the entire database. The paper contains several theoretical results that completely solve the problem of deciding whether a conjunctive view can be represented as a BID and whether a query on a partial representation is uniquely determined. We validate our approach experimentally showing that representable views exist in real and synthetic workloads and show over three magnitudes of improvement in query processing versus a lineage based approach.|Christopher Re,Dan Suciu","80637|VLDB|2006|HISA A Query System Bridging The Semantic Gap For Large Image Databases|We propose a novel system called HISA for organizing very large image databases.

The unsupervised methods use heuristic rules to select the most informative sentences into a summary directly, which are hard to generalize.

Traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness of answer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes, even if they wind up being relevant to a user query. Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such possible answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being pertinent answers to the query. The autonomous nature of web databases poses several challenges in realizing this objective. Such challenges include the restricted access privileges imposed on the data, the limited support for query patterns, and the bounded pool of database and network resources in the web environment. We introduce a novel query rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges. Our technique involves reformulating the user query based on mined correlations among the database attributes. The reformulated queries are aimed at retrieving the relevant possible answers in addition to the certain answers. QPIAD is able to gauge the relevance of such queries allowing tradeoffs in reducing the costs of database query processing and answer transmission. To support this framework, we develop methods for mining attribute correlations (in terms of Approximate Functional Dependencies), value distributions (in the form of Na&iumlve Bayes Classifiers), and selectivity estimates.

Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","16700|IJCAI|2007|Constraint Partitioning for Solving Planning Problems with Trajectory Constraints and Goal Preferences|The PDDL specifications include soft goals and trajectory constraints for distinguishing highquality plans among the many feasible plans in a solution space.

When requirements and constraints are dynamic, learning agents may be needed to allow for adaptation. One way of accomplishing learning is to observe past outcomes, using such information to improve future decisions. When limits in agents' memory or observation capabilities are assumed, one must decide on how large should the observation window be. We investigate how this decision influences both agents' and system's performance in the context of a special class of distributed resource allocation problems, namely dispersion games. We show by numerical experiments over a specific dispersion game (the Minority Game) that in such scenario an agent's performance is non-monotonically correlated with her memory size when all other agents are kept unchanged.

A lot of effort has been made to develop approximate offline algorithms to solve ever larger POMDPs. However, even state-of-the-art approaches fail to solve large POMDPs in reasonable time. Recent developments in online POMDP search suggest that combining offline computations with online computations is often more efficient and can also considerably reduce the error made by approximate policies computed offline. In the same vein, we propose a new anytime online search algorithm which seeks to minimize, as efficiently as possible, the error made by an approximate value function computed offline. In addition, we show how previous online computations can be reused in following time steps in order to prevent redundant computations. Our preliminary results indicate that our approach is able to tackle large state space and observation space efficiently and under real-time constraints.|Stéphane Ross,Brahim Chaib-draa","16522|IJCAI|2007|A Multiobjective Frontier Search Algorithm|The paper analyzes the extension of frontier search to the multiobjective framework.

In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal. Our experimental results show that TVI outperforms VI, LAO, LRTDP and HDP on our benchmark MDPs.|Peng Dai,Judy Goldsmith","16714|IJCAI|2007|AWA - A Window Constrained Anytime Heuristic Search Algorithm|This work presents an iterative anytime heuristic search algorithm called Anytime Window A* (AWA*) where node expansion is localized within a sliding window comprising of levels of the search treegraph.

These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.|Janusz Marecki,Sven Koenig,Milind Tambe","16759|IJCAI|2007|Using Linear Programming for Bayesian Exploration in Markov Decision Processes|A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge. Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming. We illustrate this approach on a few domains and compare it with other exploration algorithms.|Pablo Samuel Castro,Doina Precup","16516|IJCAI|2007|Relevance Estimation and Value Calibration of Evolutionary Algorithm Parameters|The main objective of this paper is to present and evaluate a method that helps to calibrate the parameters of an evolutionary algorithm in a systematic and semi-automated manner.

In this paper, we present and evaluate a decision-theoretic framework that captures the general notion of assistance. The objective is to observe a goal-directed agent and to select assistive actions in order to minimize the overall cost. We model the problem as an assistant POMDP where the hidden state corresponds to the agent's unobserved goals. This formulation allows us to exploit domain models for both estimating the agent's goals and selecting assistive action. In addition, the formulation naturally handles uncertainty, varying action costs, and customization to specific agents via learning. We argue that in many domains myopic heuristics will be adequate for selecting actions in the assistant POMDP and present two such heuristics. We evaluate our approach in two domains where human subjects perform tasks in game-like computer environments. The results show that the assistant substantially reduces user effort with only a modest computational effort.|Alan Fern,Sriraam Natarajan,Kshitij Judah,Prasad Tadepalli","16566|IJCAI|2007|Using a Hierarchical Bayesian Model to Handle High Cardinality Attributes with Relevant Interactions in a Classification Problem|We employed a multilevel hierarchical Bayesian model in the task of exploiting relevant interactions among high cardinality attributes in a classification problem without overfitting.

Neuroscientific studies suggest that controlled and automatic processing rely on two largely distinct neural pathways. The controlled pathway, which includes the prefrontal cortex, is seen as acquiring declarative representations of skills. In comparison, the automatic pathway is thought to develop procedural representations. Automaticity in motor skill learning involves a reduction in dependence on frontal systems and an increased reliance on the automatic pathway. In this paper, we propose a biologically plausible computational model of motor skill automaticity. This model offers a dual-pathway neurocomputational account of the translation of declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge during motor learning. In support of the model, we review some previously reported human experimental results involving the learning of a sequential key pressing task, and we demonstrate, through simulation, howthe model provides a parsimonious explanation for these results.|Ashish Gupta,David C.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on prior knowledge of the robot's physical parameters to devise sophisticated control algorithms for generating a stable gait. In this paper, we provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that a humanoid robot can learn to walk directly by imitating a human gait obtained from motion capture (mocap) data. Training using human motion capture is an intuitive and flexible approach to programming a robot but direct usage of mocap data usually results in dynamically unstable motion. Furthermore, optimization using mocap data in the humanoid full-body joint-space is typically intractable. We propose a new modelfree approach to tractable imitation-based learning in humanoids. We represent kinematic information from human motion capture in a low dimensional subspace and map motor commands in this lowdimensional space to sensory feedback to learn a predictive dynamic model. This model is used within an optimization framework to estimate optimal motor commands that satisfy the initial kinematic constraints as best as possible while at the same time generating dynamically stable motion. We demonstrate the viability of our approach by providing examples of dynamically stable walking learned from mocap data using both a simulator and a real humanoid robot.|Rawichote Chalodhorn,David B.
