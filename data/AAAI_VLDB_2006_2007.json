One important voting rule is the Slater rule. It selects a ranking of the alternatives (or candidates) to minimize the number of pairs of candidates such that the ranking disagrees with the pairwise majority vote on these two candidates. The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates. We show that this technique suffices to compute a Slater ranking in linear time if the pairwise majority graph is hierarchically structured. For the general case, we also give an efficient algorithm for finding a set of similar candidates. We provide experimental results that show that this technique significantly (sometimes drastically) speeds up search algorithms, Finally, we also use the technique of similar sets to show that computing an optimal Slater ranking is NP-hard. even in the absence of pairwise ties.|Vincent Conitzer","66161|AAAI|2007|Forgetting Actions in Domain Descriptions|Forgetting irrelevantproblematic actions in a domain description can be useful in solving reasoning problems, such as query answering, planning, conftict resolution, prediction, postdiction, etc.. Motivated by such applications, we study what forgetting is, how forgetting can be done, and for which applications forgetting can be useful and how, in the context of reasoning about actions. We study these questions in the action language C (a formalism based on causal explanations), and relate it to forgetting in classical logic and logic programming.|Esra Erdem,Paolo Ferraris","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world. The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","66230|AAAI|2007|Concurrent Action Execution with Shared Fluents|Concurrent action execution is important for plan-length minimization. However, action specifications are often limited to avoid conflicts arising from preconditioneffect interactions. PDDL -- the planning domain definition language -- for example, implements the \"no moving targets\" rule, which means that no two actions can simultaneously make use of a value if one of the two is updating the value. This rule poses problems for resource allocation planning in which resource values are accessed in preconditions and effects. A simple example is construction actions that consume certain amounts of a resource. For speeding up plan execution, we would like to be able to dispatch several construction actions simultaneously. Because action preconditions depend on resource values and action effects change them, the \"no moving targets\" rule does not allow concurrent execution. However, if sufficient resources are available, executing actions simultaneously poses no problems. This paper addresses the problem of deciding whether a set of actions produced by a planning system can be executed concurrently in the presence of fluent variables that occur in both action preconditions and effects. We first motivate the concurrent action execution problem by introducing a fair action scheduling algorithm for real-time strategy (RTS) games. Then we prove that the general decision problem, when restricting effects and preconditions to polynomial time computations, is co-NP complete. Thereafter, we focus on problem restrictions based on commutative operators which allow us to specify sufficient conditions for concurrent executability that can be checked quickly if the number of shared fluents is small. Finally, we apply these findings to action execution with shared resources in RTS games.|Michael Buro,Alexander Kovarsky","65976|AAAI|2007|Optimal Multi-Agent Scheduling with Constraint Programming|We consider the problem of computing optimal schedules in multi-agent systems. In these problems, actions of one agent can influence the actions of other agents, while the objective is to maximize the total 'quality' of the schedule. More specifically, we focus on multi-agent scheduling problems with time windows, hard and soft precedence relations, and a nonlinear objective function. We show how we can model and efficiently solve these problems with constraint programming technology. Elements of our proposed method include constraint-based reasoning, search strategies, problem decomposition, scheduling algorithms, and a linear programming relaxation. We present experimental results on realistic problem instances to display the different elements of the solution process.|Willem Jan van Hoeve,Carla P.

However, combining conditional planning with goal preferences adds some new difficulties to the problem. Indeed, even the notion of optimal plan is far from trivial, since plans in nondeterministic domains can result in several different behaviors satisfying conditions with different preferences. Planning for optimal conditional plans must therefore take into account the different behaviors, and conditionally search for the highest preference that can be achieved. In this paper, we address this problem. We formalize the notion of optimal conditional plan, and we describe a correct and complete planning algorithm that is guaranteed to find optimal solutions. We implement the algorithm using BDD-based techniques, and show the practical potentialities of our approach through a preliminary experimental evaluation.|Dmitry Shaparau,Marco Pistore,Paolo Traverso","66130|AAAI|2007|Uncertainty in Preference Elicitation and Aggregation|Uncertainty arises in preference aggregation in several ways. There may, for example, be uncertainty in the votes or the voting rule. Such uncertainty can introduce computational complexity in determining which candidate or candidates can or must win the election. In this paper, we survey recent work in this area and give some new results. We argue, for example, that the set of possible winners can be computationally harder to compute than the necessary winner. As a second example, we show that, even if the unknown votes are assumed to be single-peaked, it remains computationally hard to compute the possible and necessary winners, or to manipulate the election.|Toby Walsh","65678|AAAI|2006|Improved Bounds for Computing Kemeny Rankings|Voting (or rank aggregation) is a general method for aggregating the preferences of multiple agents.

Unfortunately, Kemeny rankings are NP-hard to compute. Recent work on computing Kemeny rankings has focused on producing good bounds to use in search-based methods. In this paper, we extend on this work by providing various improved bounding techniques. Some of these are based on cycles in the pairwise majority graph, others are based on linear programs. We completely characterize the relative strength of all of these bounds and provide some experimental results.|Vincent Conitzer,Andrew J.

Foss","65679|AAAI|2006|Nonexistence of Voting Rules That Are Usually Hard to Manipulate|Aggregating the preferences of self-interested agents is a key problem for multiagent systems, and one general method for doing so is to vote over the alternatives (candidates). Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm"],["65917|AAAI|2006|Compact Convex Upper Bound Iteration for Approximate POMDP Planning|Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are an intuitive and general way to model sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. Unfortunately, even approximate planning in POMDPs is known to be hard, and developing heuristic planners that can deliver reasonable results in practice has proved to be a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to approximate value-iteration for POMDP planning that is based on quadratic rather than piecewise linear function approximators. Specifically, we approximate the optimal value function by a convex upper bound composed of a fixed number of quadratics, and optimize it at each stage by semidefinite programming. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive approximation quality to current techniques while still maintaining a bounded size representation of the function approximator. Moreover, an upper bound on the optimal value function can be preserved if required. Overall, the technique requires computation time and space that is only linear in the number of iterations (horizon time).|Tao Wang,Pascal Poupart,Michael H.

In this paper, we show how to apply these techniques to new models for non-Markovian dynamical systems called Predictive State Representatiolls (PSRs) and Memory-PSRs (mPSRs). PSRs and mPSRs are models of non-Markovian decision processes that differ from latent-variable models (e.g. HMMs, POMDPs) by representing state using only observable quantities. Further, mPSRs explicitly represent certain structural properties of the dynamical system that are also relevant to planning. We show how planning techniques can be adapted to leverage this structure to improve performance both in terms of execution time as well as quality of the resulting policy.|Michael R.

By learning these models and extending Porta's continuous state POMDP framework (Porta et at. ) to incorporate this switching dynamics model, we hope to handle tasks that involve absolute and relative dynamics within a single framework. This dynamics model may be applicable not only to object manipulation tasks, but also to a number of other problems, such as robot navigation. By using an explicit model of uncertainty, I hope to create solutions to object manipulation tasks that more robustly handle the noisy sensory information received by physical robots.|Emma Brunskill","66222|AAAI|2007|Scaling Up Solving POMDPs through Value Based Clustering|Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide an appropriately rich model for agents operating under partial knowledge of the environment.

We show for the first time how relevant multi-agent belief states can be computed. Building on this insight, we then show how the linear programming part in current multi-agent DP algorithms can be avoided, and how multi-agent DP can thus be applied to solve larger problems.

A number of optimal basis functions are determined by the algorithm to minimize the Bellman residual incrementally, via efficient computations. We show that, by using optimally determined basis functions, the policy can be improved successively on a set of most probable belief points sampled from the reachable belief set. As the ILSPI is based on belief sample points, it represents a point-based policy iteration method. The results on four benchmark problems show that the ILSPI compares competitively to its value-iteration counterparts in terms of both performance and computational efficiency.|Hui Li,Xuejun Liao,Lawrence Carin","66182|AAAI|2007|Situated Conversational Agents|A Situated Conversational Agent (SCA) is an agent that engages in dialog about the context within which it is embedded.

This paper describes initial research into the construction of an SCA that engages in dialog about collaborative physical tasks, in which agents engage in dialog with the joint goal of manipulating the physical context in some manner. Constructing an SCA that can interact naturally in such tasks requires an agent with the ability to interleave planning, action, and observation while operating in a partially observable environment. Consequently, I propose to model an SCA as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).|William Thompson","66064|AAAI|2007|Optimizing Anthrax Outbreak Detection Using Reinforcement Learning|The potentially catastrophic impact of a bioterrorist attack makes developing effective detection methods essential for public health.

The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision.

In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections.

Efficient sharing of computations among multiple continuous queries, especially for the memory- and CPU-intensive window-based operations, is critical. A novel challenge in this scenario is to allow resource sharing among similar queries, even if they employ windows of different lengths. This paper first reviews the existing sharing methods in the literature, and then illustrates the significant performance shortcomings of these methods.This paper then presents a novel paradigm for the sharing of window join queries. Namely we slice window states of a join operator into fine-grained window slices and form a chain of sliced window joins. By using an elaborate pipelining methodology, the number of joins after state slicing is reduced from quadratic to linear. This novel sharing paradigm enables us to push selections down into the chain and flexibly select subsequences of such sliced window joins for computation sharing among queries with different window sizes. Based on the state-slice sharing paradigm, two algorithms are proposed for the chain buildup. One minimizes the memory consumption while the other minimizes the CPU usage. The algorithms are proven to find the optimal chain with respect to memory or CPU usage for a given query workload. We have implemented the slice-share paradigm within the data stream management system CAPE.

In this scenario, a data owner (DO) constantly transmits its data to a service provider (SP), together with additional authentication information. Clients register continuous range queries to the SP. Whenever the data change, the SP must update the results of all affected queries and inform the clients accordingly. The clients can verify the correctness of the results using the authentication information provided by the DO. Compared to conventional databases, stream environments pose new challenges such as the need for fast structure updating, support for continuous query processing and authentication, and provision for temporal completeness. Specifically, in addition to the correctness of individual results, the client must be able to verify that there are no missing results in between updates. We face these challenges through several contributions. Since there is no previous work, we first present a technique, called REF, that achieves correctness and temporal completeness but incurs false transmissions, i.e., the SP has to inform clients whenever there is a data update, even if their results are not affected.

However, traditional information retrieval techniques are likely to be expensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized. Our performance evaluation using the INEX data set in the Quark  open-source XML database system indicates that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient.|Feng Shao,Lin Guo,Chavdar Botev,Anand Bhaskar,Muthiah Chettiar,Fan Yang 0002,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram","80828|VLDB|2007|Processing Forecasting Queries|Forecasting future events based on historic data is useful in many domains like system management, adaptive query processing, environmental monitoring, and financial planning.

Fa supports efficient algorithms to generate execution plans automatically for forecasting queries from a novel plan space comprising operators for transforming data, learning statistical models from data, and doing inference using the learned models. In addition, Fa supports adaptive query-processing algorithms that adapt plans for continuous forecasting queries to the time-varying properties of input data streams.

In this paper, we examine the problem of how to schedule CQs in a DSMS to optimize for average QoS. We show that unlike standard on-line systems, scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will be different than policies that optimize for average slowdown which is more appropriate metric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. We also propose a hybrid scheduling policy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness. We further discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploit sharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs. It is also robust and bears negligible computational overhead.|Yi-Cheng Tu,Song Liu,Sunil Prabhakar,Bin Yao","80769|VLDB|2007|Structured Materialized Views for XML Queries|The performance of XML database queries can be greatly enhanced by rewriting them using materialized views.

The pattern language features optional nodes and nesting, allowing to capture the data needs of nested XQueries. The language also allows describing storage features such as structural identifiers, which enlarge the space of rewritings.

Given a set S of sites, a set O of weighted objects, and a spatial region Q, the min-dist optimal-location query returns a location in Q which, if a new site is built there, minimizes the average distance from each object to its closest site. This query can help a franchise (e.g. McDonald's) decide where to put a new store in order to maximize the benefit to its customers. To solve this problem is challenging, for there are theoretically infinite number of locations in Q, all of which could be candidates. This paper first provides a theorem that limits the number of candidate locations without losing the power to find exact answers. Then it provides a progressive algorithm that quickly suggests a location, tells the maximum error it may have, and keeps refining the result. When the algorithm finishes, the exact answer can be found. The intermediate result of early runs can be used to prune the search space for later runs. Crucial to the pruning technique are novel lower-bound estimators. The proposed algorithm, the effect of several optimizations, and the progressiveness are experimentally evaluated.|Donghui Zhang,Yang Du,Tian Xia,Yufei Tao","65879|AAAI|2006|Identification of Joint Interventional Distributions in Recursive Semi-Markovian Causal Models|This paper is concerned with estimating the effects of actions from causal assumptions, represented concisely as a directed graph, and statistical knowledge, given as a probability distribution.

ASSAT and CMODELS are two well-known such systems. They find an answer set from the full models for the completion of the input program, which is (iteratively) augmented with loop formulas. Making use of the fact that, for non-tight programs, during the model generation, a partial assignment may be extensible to a full model but may not grow into any answer set, we propose to add answer set extensibility checking on partial assignments. Furthermore, given a partial assignment, we identify a class of loop formulas that are \"active\" on the assignment. These \"active\" formulas can be used to prune the search space. We also provide an efficient method to generate these formulas. These ideas can be implemented with a moderate modification on SAT solvers. We have developed a new answer set solver SAG on top of the SAT solver MCHAFF. Empirical studies on well-known benchmarks show that in most cases it is faster than the state-of-the-art answer set solvers, often by an order of magnitude.

Given a set of data points P and a set of query points Q each data point has a number of derived spatial attributes each of which is the point's distance to a query point. An SSQ retrieves those points of P which are not dominated by any other point in P considering their derived spatial attributes. The main difference with the regular skyline query is that this spatial domination depends on the location of the query points Q SSQ has application in several domains such as emergency response and online maps. The main intuition and novelty behind our approaches is that we exploit the geometric properties of the SSQ problem space to avoid the exhaustive examination of all the point pairs in P and Q. Consequently, we reduce the complexity of SSQ search from O(PQ) to O(SC+P), where S and C are the solution size and the number of vertices of the convex hull of Q, respectively.We propose two algorithms, BS and VS, for static query points and one algorithm, VCS, for streaming Q whose points change location over time (e.g., are mobile). VCS exploits the pattern of change in Q to avoid unnecessary re-computation of the skyline and hence efficiently perform updates. Our extensive experiments using real-world datasets verify that both R-tree-based BS and Voronoi-based VS out perform the best competitor approach in terms of processing time by a wide margin (- times better in most cases).|Mehdi Sharifzadeh,Cyrus Shahabi","66221|AAAI|2007|On the Identification of a Class of Linear Models|This paper deals with the problem of identifying direct causal effects in recursive linear structural equation models.

The optimal actions can now depend on the total reward that has been accumulated so far in addition to the current state. We extend our previous work on functional value iteration from one-switch utility functions to all utility functions that can be approximated with piecewise linear utility functions (with and without exponential tails) by using functional value iteration to find a plan that maximizes the expected total utility for the approximate utility function. Functional value iteration does not maintain a value for every state but a value function that maps the total reward that has been accumulated so far into a value. We describe how functional value iteration represents these value functions in finite form, how it performs dynamic programming by manipulating these representations and what kinds of approximation guarantees it is able to make.

We examine the incentive properties of incremental mechanisms when minimax regret is used to determine allocations with no additional elicitation of payment information, and when additional payment information is obtained. We argue that elicitation effort can be focused simultaneously on reducing allocation and payment uncertainty.|Nathanael Hyafil,Craig Boutilier"],["65677|AAAI|2006|Computing Slater Rankings Using Similarities among Candidates|Voting (or rank aggregation) is a general method for aggregating the preferences of multiple agents. One important voting rule is the Slater rule. It selects a ranking of the alternatives (or candidates) to minimize the number of pairs of candidates such that the ranking disagrees with the pairwise majority vote on these two candidates. The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates. We show that this technique suffices to compute a Slater ranking in linear time if the pairwise majority graph is hierarchically structured. For the general case, we also give an efficient algorithm for finding a set of similar candidates. We provide experimental results that show that this technique significantly (sometimes drastically) speeds up search algorithms, Finally, we also use the technique of similar sets to show that computing an optimal Slater ranking is NP-hard. even in the absence of pairwise ties.|Vincent Conitzer","66163|AAAI|2007|Computational Complexity of Weighted Threshold Games|Weighted threshold games are coalitional games in which each player has a weight (intuitively corresponding to its voting power), and a coalition is successful if the sum of its weights exceeds a given threshold.

We consider three different types of covering (upward, downward, and bidirectional) and the corresponding solution concepts known as the uncovered set and the minimal covering set. We present the first polynomial-time algorithm for finding the minimal bidirectional covering set (an acknowledged open problem) and prove that deciding whether an alternative is in a minimal upward or downward covering set is NP-hard. Furthermore, we obtain various set-theoretical inclusions, which reveal a strong connection between von Neumann-Morgenstern stable sets and upward covering on the one hand, and the Banks set and downward covering on the other hand. In particular, we show that every stable set is also a minimal upward covering set.|Felix Brandt,Felix A.

In this paper, we generalize this by order-independent sequential composition and strong decomposability, which are independent of the chosen order. We study to which extent some usual properties of voting rules transfer from the local rules to their order-independent sequential composition. Then, to capture the idea that a voting rule is neutral or decomposable on a slightly smaller domain, we define nearly neutral, nearly decomposable rules for both sequential composition and order-independent sequential composition, which leads us to defining and studying decomposable permutations.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm"],["66108|AAAI|2007|Making the Difference in Semantic Web Service Composition|Automation of Web service composition is one of the most interesting challenges facing the Semantic Web today.

Given a set of evaluative texts on the Web, e.g., reviews, forum postings, and news articles, the task of comparative sentence mining is () to identify comparative sentences from the texts and () to extract comparative relations from the identified comparative sentences. This problem has many applications. For example, a product manufacturer wants to know customer opinions of its products in comparison with those of its competitors. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques based on two new types of sequential rules to perform the tasks. Experimental evaluation has been conducted using different types of evaluative texts from the Web. Results show that our techniques are very promising.|Nitin Jindal,Bing Liu","65710|AAAI|2006|Inconsistencies Negations and Changes in Ontologies|Ontology management and maintenance are considered cornerstone issues in current Semantic Web applications in which semantic integration and ontological reasoning play a fundamental role. The ability to deal with inconsistency and to accommodate change is of utmost importance in real-world applications of ontological reasoning and management, wherein the need for expressing negated assertions also arises naturally. For this purpose, precise, formal definitions of the the different types of inconsistency and negation in ontologies are required. Unfortunately, ontology languages based on Description Logics (DLs) do not provide enough expressive power to represent axiom negations. Furthermore, there is no single, well-accepted notion of inconsistency and negation in the Semantic Web community, due to the lack of a common and solid foundational framework. In this paper, we propose a general framework accounting for inconsistency, negation and change in ontologies. Different levels of negation and inconsistency in DL-based ontologies are distinguished. We demonstrate how this framework can provide a foundation for reasoning with and management of dynamic ontologies.|Giorgos Flouris,Zhisheng Huang,Jeff Z.

Data management continues to grow, more than doubling in data and transaction volumes every two years with a growth in deployments to fuel a $ billion market. A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications. While data management growth will continue based primarily on the relational data model and conventional DBMSs, a much larger and more challenging data management world is emerging. In the 's data under DBMS management reached % of the world's data. The six-fold growth of non-relational data in the period -- will reduce that number to well below %. We are entering the next generation of computing with a fundamentally different computing model and paradigm characterized technologically by multi-core architectures, virtualization, service-oriented computing, and the semantic web. Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities. Missing this opportunity will be worse than missing the Internet. The semantic web will become the means by which information is accessed and managed with modest projections of  billion pages with hundreds of triples per page - the largest distributed system in the world - the only one.

First, we extend the recently proposed Argument Interchange Format (AIF) to express arguments with a structure based on Walton's theory of argumentation schemes. Then, we describe an implementation of this ontology using the RDF Schema language, and demonstrate how our ontology enables the representation of networks of arguments on the Semantic Web. Finally, we present a pilot Semantic Web-based system, ArgDF, through which users can create arguments using different argumentation schemes and can query arguments using a Semantic Web query language. Users can also attack or support parts of existing arguments, use existing parts of an argument in the creation of new arguments, or create new argumentation schemes.

Viewing software components as web services, the current solutions to web services composition based on business web services (using WSDL, BPEL, SOAP etc.) or semantic web services (using ontologies, goal-directed reasoning etc.) are both piecemeal and insufficient for building practical applications. Inspired by the work in Al planning on decoupling causal (planning) and resource reasoning (scheduling), we introduced the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the current approaches. The solution is based on a novel two-staged composition approach that addresses the information modeling aspects of web services, provides support for contextual information while composing services, employs efficient decoupling of functional and non-functional requirements, and leads to improved scalability and failure handling. A prototype of the solution has been implemented in the Synthy service composition system and applied to a number of composition scenarios from the telecom domain. The application of planning to web services has also brought new plan and planner usability-driven research issues to the fore for AI.|Biplav Srivastava","80807|VLDB|2007|PP Authority Analysis for Social Communities|PageRank-style authority analyses of Web graphs are of great importance for Web mining. Such authority analyses also apply to hot \"Web .\" applications that exhibit a natural graph structure, such as social networks (e.g., MySpace, Facebook) or tagging communities (e.g., Flickr, Del.icio.us). Finding the most trustworthy or most important authorities in such a community is a pressing need, given the huge scale and also the anonymity of social networks. Computing global authority measures in a Peer-to-Peer (PP) collaboration of autonomous peers is a hot research topic, in particular because of the incomplete local knowledge of the peers, which typically only know about (arbitrarily overlapping) sub-graphs of the complete graph. We demonstrate a self-organizing PP collaboration that, based on the local sub-graphs, efficiently computes global authority scores. In hand with the loosely-coupled spirit of a PP system, the computation is carried out in a completely asynchronous manner without any central knowledge or coordinating instance. We demonstrate the applicability of authority analyses to large-scale distributed systems.|Josiane Xavier Parreira,Sebastian Michel,Matthias Bender,Tom Crecelius,Gerhard Weikum","80829|VLDB|2007|EntityRank Searching Entities Directly and Holistically|As the Web has evolved into a data-rich repository, with the standard \"page view,\" current search engines are becoming increasingly inadequate for a wide range of query tasks.

However, traditional information retrieval techniques are likely to be expensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized. Our performance evaluation using the INEX data set in the Quark  open-source XML database system indicates that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient.|Feng Shao,Lin Guo,Chavdar Botev,Anand Bhaskar,Muthiah Chettiar,Fan Yang 0002,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram","66120|AAAI|2007|Filtering Decomposition and Search Space Reduction for Optimal Sequential Planning|We present in this paper a hybrid planning system Which combines constraint satisfaction techniques and planning heuristics to produce optimal sequential plans.

This structure is incrementally built Each time it is extended, a sequential plan is searched. Different search strategies may be employed. Currently, it is a forward chaining search based on problem decomposition with action sets partitioning. Various techniques are used to reduce the search space, such as memorizing nogood states or estimating goals reachability. In addition, the planner implements two different techniques to avoid enumerating some equivalent action sequences.

The key novelty is an original use of state memorization during search to prevent the exploration of similar subnetworks. Classical techniques to avoid the resurgence of previously encountered conflicts involve recording conflict sets. This contrasts with our state-based approach which records subnetworks - a snapshot of some selected domains - already explored. This knowledge is later used to either prune inconsistent states or avoid recomputing the solutions of these subnetworks. Interestingly enough, the two approaches present some complementarity different states can be pruned from the same partial instantiation or conflict set, whereas different partial instantiations can lead to the same state that needs to be explored only once. Also, our proposed approach is able to dynamically break some kinds of symmetries (e.g. neighborhood interchangeability).

The previous state-of-the-art system achieves temporal preference optimization using a SAT formulation, with its creators attributing its performance to advances in SAT solving techniques. We depart from the SAT encoding and instead introduce the Valued DTP (VDTP). In contrast to the traditional semiring-based formalism that annotates legal tuples of a constraint with preferences, our framework instead assigns elementary costs to the constraints themselves. After proving that the VDTP can express the same set of utilitarian optimal solutions as the DTPP with piecewise-constant preference functions, we develop a method for achieving weighted constraint satisfaction within a meta-CSP search space that has traditionally been used to solve DTPs without preferences. This allows us to directly incorporate several powerful techniques developed in previous decision-based DTP literature. Finally, we present empirical results demonstrating that an implementation of our approach consistently outperforms the SAT-based solver by orders of magnitude.|Michael D. Moffitt,Martha E.

To solve the GMAP, we introduce a novel distributed solution protocol using Lagrangian decomposition and distributed constraint satisfaction, where the agents solve their individual optimization problems and coordinate their locally optimized solutions through a distributed constraint satisfaction technique. Next, to produce quick agreement between the agents on a feasible solution with reasonably good quality, we provide a parameter that controls the range of \"noise\" mixed with an incrementdecrement in a Lagrange multiplier. Our experimental results indicate that the parameter may allow us to control tradeoffs between the quality of a solution and the cost of finding it.|Katsutoshi Hirayama","65988|AAAI|2007|Using Expectation Maximization to Find Likely Assignments for Solving CSPs|We present a new probabilistic framework for finding likely variable assignments in difficult constraint satisfaction problems. Finding such assignments is key to efficient search, but practical efforts have largely been limited to random guessing and heuristically designed weighting systems. In contrast, we derive a new version of Belief Propagation (BP) using the method of Expectation Maximization (EM). This allows us to differentiate between variables that are strongly biased toward particular values and those that are largely extraneous. Using EM also eliminates the threat of non-convergence associated with regular BP. Theoretically, the derivation exhibits appealing primaldual semantics. Empirically, it produces an \"EMBP\"-based heuristic for solving constraint satisfaction problems, as illustrated with respect to the Quasigroup with Holes domain.

Our first strategy uses additional binary variables for the CSP, and applies an XOR or parity constraint based method introduced previously for Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. In the CSP framework, in addition to the naive individual filtering of XOR constraints used in SAT, we are able to apply a global domain filtering algorithm by viewing these constraints as a collection of linear equalities over the field of two elements. Our most promising strategy extends this approach further to larger domains, and applies the so-called generalized XOR constraints directly to CSP variables. This allows us to reap the benefits of the compact and structured representation that CSPs offer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our counting framework through experimental comparisons with the solution enumeration approach (which, we believe, is the current best generic solution counting method for CSPs), and with solution counting in the context of SAT and integer programming.|Carla P.

In principle, we as programmers can provide the agents with the required semantics, but this will compromise the autonomy of the agent. To overcome this problem, we may fall back on natural agents and see how they acquire meaning of their own sensory states, their neural firing patterns. We can learn a lot about what certain neural spikes mean by carefully controlling the input stimulus while observing how the neurons fire. However, neurons embedded in the brain do not have direct access to the outside stimuli, so such a stimulus-to-spike association may not be learnable at all. How then can the brain solve this problem (We know it does.) We propose that motor interaction with the environment is necessary to overcome this conundrum. Further, we provide a simple yet powerful criterion, sensory invariance, for learning the meaning of sensory states. The basic idea is that a particular form of action sequence that maintains invariance of a sensory state will express the key property of the environmental stimulus that gave rise to the sensory state. Our experiments with a sensorimotor agent trained on natural images show that sensory invariance can indeed serve as a powerful objective for semantic grounding.|Yoonsuck Choe,Noah H.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries.

In this paper we study k-NN monitoring in road networks, where the distance between a query and a data object is determined by the length of the shortest path connecting them. We propose two methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns, as well as fluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing only updates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the shared execution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections. We experimentally verify the applicability of the proposed techniques to continuous monitoring of large data and query sets.|Kyriakos Mouratidis,Man Lung Yiu,Dimitris Papadias,Nikos Mamoulis","65931|AAAI|2006|An Efficient Algorithm for Local Distance Metric Learning|Learning application-specific distance metrics from labeled data is critical for both statistical classification and information retrieval.

In this paper, we compare deterministic dependency parsers with complex parsing methods such as generative and discriminative parsers on the standard data set of Penn Chinese Treebank. The results show that, for Chinese dependency parsing, deterministic parsers outperform generative and discriminative parsers. Furthermore, based on the observation that deterministic parsing algorithms are greedy algorithms which choose the most probable parsing action at every step, we propose three kinds of ungreedy deterministic dependency parsing algorithms to globally model parsing actions. Results show that ungreedy deterministic dependency parsers perform better than original deterministic dependency parsers while maintaining the same time complexity, and our best parser improves much over all other parsers.|Xiangyu Duan,Jun Zhao,Bo Xu","80795|VLDB|2007|HiSbase Histogram-based PP Main Memory Data Management|Many e-science communities, e. g., medicine, climatology, and astrophysics, are overwhelmed by the exponentially growing data volumes that need to be accessible by collaborating researchers.

In such an analysis, critical numerical measures, such as profit and sales, fluctuate over time and form time-series data. Moreover, the time series data correspond to market segments, which are described by a set of attributes, such as age, gender, education, income level, and product-category, that form a multi-dimensional structure. To better understand market dynamics and predict future trends, it is crucial to study the dynamics of time-series in multi-dimensional market segments. This is a topic that has been largely ignored in time series and data cube research. In this study, we examine the issues of anomaly detection in multi-dimensional time-series data. We propose time-series data cube to capture the multi-dimensional space formed by the attribute structure. This facilitates the detection of anomalies based on expected values derived from higher level, \"more general\" time-series. Anomaly detection in a time-series data cube poses computational challenges, especially for high-dimensional, large data sets. To this end, we also propose an efficient search algorithm to iteratively select subspaces in the original high-dimensional space and detect anomalies within each one.

Many complex engineered systems comprise embedded features to perform self-diagnosis or self-reconfiguration. These features require fast response times in order to be useful in domains where embedded systems are typically deployed. Researchers often advocate the use of compilation-based approaches to store the set of environments (resp. solutions) to a diagnosis (resp. reconfiguration) problem, in some compact representation. However, the size of a compiled representation may be exponential in the treewidth of the problem. In this paper we propose a novel method for compiling the most preferred environments in order to reduce the large space requirements of our compiled representation. We show that approximate compilation is an effective means of generating the highest-valued environments, while obtaining a representation whose size can be tailored to any embedded application. The method also provides a graceful way to tradeoff space requirements with the completeness of our coverage of the environment space.|Barry O'Sullivan,Gregory M.

Many online solutions for this problem make use of simplifying assumptions, such as Gaussian noise models and linear system behaviour and also adopt a filtering strategy which may not use available information optimally. These assumptions allow near real-time inference, while also limiting accuracy and introducing the potential for ill-conditioning and divergence. We consider augmenting a particular real-time estimation method, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), with a more complex, but more highly accurate, inference technique based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. Conventional MCMC techniques applied to this problem can entail significant and time consuming computation to achieve convergence. To address this, we propose an intelligent bootstrapping process and the use of parallel, communicative chains of different temperatures, commonly referred to as parallel tempering. The combined approach is shown to provide substantial improvement in a realistic simulated mapping environment and when applied to a complex physical system involving a robotic platform moving in an office environment instrumented with a camera sensor network.|Dimitri Marinakis,David Meger,Ioannis M.

The problem is to determine, on-line, all faults and states that explain the flow of observations. Model-based diagnosis approaches that first compile the diagnosis information off-line suffer from space explosion, and those that operate on-line without any prior compilation have poor time performance. Our contribution is a broader spectrum of approaches that suits applications with diverse time and space requirements. Approaches on this spectrum differ in the amount of reasoning and compilation performed off-line and therefore in the way they resolve the tradeoff between the space occupied by the compiled information and the time taken to produce a diagnosis. We tackle the space and time complexity of diagnosis by encoding all approaches in a symbolic framework based on binary decision diagrams. This allows for the compact representation of the compiled diagnosis information, and for its handling across many states at once rather than for each state individually. Our experiments demonstrate the diversity and scalability of our symbolic methods spectrum, as well as its superiority over the corresponding enumerative implementations.|Anika Schumann,Yannick Pencolé,Sylvie Thiébaux","66086|AAAI|2007|Near-optimal Observation Selection using Submodular Functions|AI problems such as autonomous robotic exploration, automatic diagnosis and activity recognition have in common the need for choosing among a set of informative but possibly expensive observations. When monitoring spatial phenomena with sensor networks or mobile robots, for example, we need to decide which locations to observe in order to most effectively decrease the uncertainty, at minimum cost. These problems usually are NP-hard. Many observation selection objectives satisfy submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property - adding a sensor to a small deployment helps more than adding it to a large deployment.

The underlying knowledge can be conveniently formulated as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem where the constraints are propositional formulas. The problem of interactive configuration was originally inspired by the product configuration problem with the emergence of the masscustomization paradigm in product manufacturing, but has also been applied to other tasks requiring user interaction, such as specifying services or setting up complex equipment. The user-friendly requirements of complete, backtrack-free and real-time interaction makes the problem computationally challenging. Therefore, it is beneficial to compile the configuration constraints into a tractable representation such as Binary Decision Diagrams (BOD) (Bryant ) to support efficient user interaction. The compilation deals with the NP-hardness such that the online interaction is in polynomial time in the size of the BOD. In this paper we address the problem of extending configurators so that a user can interactively limit configuration choices based on a maximum cost (such as price or weight of a product) of any valid configuration, in a complete, backtrack-free and real-time manner. The current BOD compilation approach is not adequate for this purpose, since adding the total cost information to the constraints description can dramatically increase the size of the compiled BOD.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","65976|AAAI|2007|Optimal Multi-Agent Scheduling with Constraint Programming|We consider the problem of computing optimal schedules in multi-agent systems.

Existing approaches that solve Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) suffer from the fact that they can only solve relatively small problems without complex constraints on task execution. OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings. Experimental results are shown to support our claims.|Aurélie Beynier,Abdel-Illah Mouaddib","65933|AAAI|2006|Hard Constrained Semi-Markov Decision Processes|In multiple criteria Markov Decision Processes (MDP) where multiple costs are incurred at every decision point, current methods solve them by minimising the expected primary cost criterion while constraining the expectations of other cost criteria to some critical values. However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted.

We propose a general-purpose Web Service Management System (WSMS) that enables querying multiple web services in a transparent and integrated fashion. This paper tackles a first basic WSMS problem query optimization for Select-Project-Join queries spanning multiple web services. Our main result is an algorithm for arranging a query's web service calls into a pipelined execution plan that optimally exploits parallelism among web services to minimize the query's total running time. Surprisingly, the optimal plan can be found in polynomial time even in the presence of arbitrary precedence constraints among web services, in contrast to traditional query optimization where the analogous problem is NP-hard. We also give an algorithm for determining the optimal granularity of data \"chunks\" to be used for each web service call. Experiments with an initial prototype indicate that our algorithms can lead to significant performance improvement over more straightforward techniques.|Utkarsh Srivastava,Kamesh Munagala,Jennifer Widom,Rajeev Motwani","66162|AAAI|2007|Reasoning about Attribute Authenticity in a Web Environment|The reliable authentication of user attributes is an important prerequisite for the security of web based applications.

For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states. We also show its superior performance over the centralized schemes in terms of update, query, and total communication costs.|Arnab Bhattacharya,Anand Meka,Ambuj K.

The identifiability question asks whether it is possible to compute the probability of some set of (effect) variables given intervention on another set of (intervention) variables, in the presence of non-observable (i.e., hidden or latent) variables. It is well known that the answer to the question depends on the structure of the causal Bayesian network, the set of observable variables, the set of effect variables, and the set of intervention variables. Our work is based on the work of Tian, Pearl, Huang, and Valtorta (Tian & Pearl a b  Huang & Valtorta a) and extends it. We show that the identify algorithm that Tian and Pearl define and prove sound for semi-Markovian models can be transfered to general causal graphs and is not only sound, but also complete.

In the context of information integration, this problem has received significant attention in the scope of emerging infrastructures such as WWW, Semantic Web, Grid, and PP which require efficient algorithms. The problem is in general intractable, and the current algorithms do not scale well when the number of views or the size of the query grow. We show however that this problem can be encoded as a propositional theory in CNF such that its models are in correspondence with the rewritings of the query. The theory is then compiled into a normal form, that is called d-DNNF and supports several operations like model counting and enumeration in polynomial time (in the size of the compiled theory), for computing the rewritings. Although this method is also intractable in the general case, it is not necessarily so in all cases. We have developed, along these lines and from off-the-shelf propositional engines, novel algorithms for finding maximally-contained rewritings of the query given the set of accessible resources (views).

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries. A thorough experimental study evaluates the efficiency of the proposed technique.|Gautam Das,Dimitrios Gunopulos,Nick Koudas,Nikos Sarkas","80706|VLDB|2006|Window-Aware Load Shedding for Aggregation Queries over Data Streams|Data stream management systems may be subject to higher input rates than their resources can handle.

In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

The general form of this problem requests the k highest ranked values from a relation, using monotone combining functions on (a subset of) its attributes.In this paper we explore space performance tradeoffs related to this problem. In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries.

We formalize both problems and present efficient algorithms for their solution.

Their execution is typically divided between the federated server and the remote data sources. Outdated and incomplete statistics have a bigger impact on federated DBMS than on regular DBMS, as maintenance of federated statistics is unequally more complicated and expensive than the maintenance of the local statistics consequently bad performance commonly occurs for federated queries due to the selection of a suboptimal query plan. To solve this problem we propose a progressive optimization technique for federated queries called POPFED by extending the state of the art for progressive reoptimization for local source queries, POP . POPFED uses (a) an opportunistic, but risk controlled reoptimization technique for federated DBMS, (b) a technique for multiple reoptimizations during federated query processing with a strategy to discover redundant and eliminate partial results, and (c) a mechanism to eagerly procure statistics in a federated environment.

Top-k queries operate on index lists for a query's elementary conditions and aggregate scores for result candidates. One of the best implementation methods in this setting is the family of threshold algorithms, which aim to terminate the index scans as early as possible based on lower and upper bounds for the final scores of result candidates. This procedure performs sequential disk accesses for sorted index scans, but also has the option of performing random accesses to resolve score uncertainty. This entails scheduling for the two kinds of accesses ) the prioritization of different index lists in the sequential accesses, and ) the decision on when to perform random accesses and for which candidates.The prior literature has studied some of these scheduling issues, but only for each of the two access types in isolation. The current paper takes an integrated view of the scheduling issues and develops novel strategies that outperform prior proposals by a large margin. Our main contributions are new, principled, scheduling methods based on a Knapsack-related optimization for sequential accesses and a cost model for random accesses. The methods can be further boosted by harnessing probabilistic estimators for scores, selectivities, and index list correlations.

In the Semantic Web and other domains, ontologies are increasingly seen also as a mechanism to access and query data repositories. This novel context poses an original combination of challenges that has not been addressed before (i) sufficient expressive power of the DL to capture common data modeling constructs (ii) well established and flexible query mechanisms such as Conjunctive Queries (CQs) (iii) optimization of inference techniques with respect to data size, which typically dominates the size of ontologies. This calls for investigating data complexity of query answering in expressive DLs. While the complexity of DLs has been studied extensively, data complexity has been characterized only for answering atomic queries, and was still open for answering CQs in expressive DLs. We tackle this issue and prove a tight CONP upper bound for the problem in SHIQ, as long as no transitive roles occur in the query. We thus establish that for a whole range of DLs from AL to SHIQ, answering CQs with no transitive roles has CONP-complete data complexity. We obtain our result by a novel tableaux-based algorithm for checking query entailment, inspired by the one in , but which manages the technical challenges of simultaneous inverse roles and number restrictions (which leads to a DL lacking the finite model property).|Magdalena Ortiz,Diego Calvanese,Thomas Eiter","80852|VLDB|2007|Efficient Processing of Top-k Dominating Queries on Multi-Dimensional Data|The top-k dominating query returns k data objects which dominate the highest number of objects in a dataset.

In this paper we introduce two classes of best-first ANDOR search algorithms those that explore a context-minimal ANDOR search graph and use static variable orderings, and those that use dynamic variable orderings but explore an ANDOR search tree. The superiority of the best-first search approach is demonstrated empirically on various real-world benchmarks.|Radu Marinescu 0002,Rina Dechter","65879|AAAI|2006|Identification of Joint Interventional Distributions in Recursive Semi-Markovian Causal Models|This paper is concerned with estimating the effects of actions from causal assumptions, represented concisely as a directed graph, and statistical knowledge, given as a probability distribution. We provide a necessary and sufficient graphical condition for the cases when the causal effect of an arbitrary set of variables on another arbitrary set can be determined uniquely from the available information, as well as an algorithm which computes the effect whenever this condition holds. Furthermore, we use our results to prove completeness of do-calculus Pearl, , and a version of an identification algorithm in Tian,  for the same identification problem. Finally, we derive a complete characterization of semi-Markovian models in which all causal effects are identifiable.|Ilya Shpitser,Judea Pearl","65957|AAAI|2007|Computing Pure Nash Equilibria in Symmetric Action Graph Games|We analyze the problem of computing pure Nash equilibria in action graph games (AGGs), which are a compact game-theoretic representation. While the problem is NP-complete in general, for certain classes of AGGs there exist polynomial time algorithms. We propose a dynamic-programming approach that constructs equilibria of the game from equilibria of restricted games played on subgraphs of the action graph. In particular, if the game is symmetric and the action graph has bounded treewidth, our algorithm determines the existence of pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time.|Albert Xin Jiang,Kevin Leyton-Brown","65910|AAAI|2006|A Characterization of Interventional Distributions in Semi-Markovian Causal Models|We offer a complete characterization of the set of distributions that could be induced by local interventions on variables governed by a causal Bayesian network of unknown structure, in which some of the variables remain unmeasured.

However, players do not see games in the same light most consider Go or Chess to be more complex than Monopoly. In this paper, we discuss a new measure of game complexity that links existing state-of-the-art algorithms for computing approximate equilibria to a more human measure. In particular, we consider the range of skill in a game, i.e. how many different skill levels exist. We then modify existing techniques to design a new algorithm to compute approximate equilibria whose performance can be captured by this new measure. We use it to develop the first near Nash equilibrium for a four round abstraction of poker, and show that it would have been able to win handily the bankroll competition from last year's AAAI poker competition.|Martin Zinkevich,Michael H.

It is often of interest to find the conditions under which a game is stable, i.e., the players have reached a consensus on their actions. In this paper, we characterize how different topologies of the interaction network affect the probability of existence of a pure Nash equilibrium in a graphical game with random payoffs. We show that for tree topologies with unbounded diameter the probability of a pure Nash equilibrium vanishes as the number of players grows large. On the positive side, we define several families of graphs for which the probability of a pure Nash equilibrium is at least -e even as the number of players goes to infinity. We also empirically show that adding a small number of connection \"shortcuts\" can increase the probability of pure Nash.|Bistra N. Dilkina,Carla P.

A robot may tour an environment, gathering information every hour. In a wireless sensor network, these tours correspond to packets being transmitted. In these settings, we are often faced with resource restrictions, like energy constraints. The users issue queries with certain expectations on the answer quality. Thus, we must optimize the tours to ensure the satisfaction of the user constraints, while at the same time minimize the cost of the query plan. For a single timestep, this optimization problem is NP-hard, but recent approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees provide good solutions. In this paper, we present a new efficient algorithm, exploiting dynamic programming and submodularity of the information collected, that efficiently plans data collection tours for an entire (finite) horizon. Our algorithm can use any single step procedure as a black box, and, based on its properties, provides strong theoretical guarantees for the solution. We also provide an extensive empirical analysis demonstrating the benefits of nonmyopic planning in two real world sensing applications.|Alexandra Meliou,Andreas Krause,Carlos Guestrin,Joseph M.

In some sense, social text streams are sensors of the real world. Often, it is desirable to extract real world events from the social text streams. However, existing event detection research mainly focused only on the stream properties of social text streams but ignored the contextual, temporal, and social information embedded in the streams. In this paper, we propose to detect events from social text streams by exploring the content as well as the temporal, and social dimensions. We define the term event as the information flow between a group of social actors on a specific topic over a certain time period. We represent social text streams as multi-graphs, where each node represents a social actor and each edge represents the information flow between two actors. The content and temporal associations within the flow of information are embedded in the corresponding edge. Events are detected by combining text based clustering, temporal segmentation, and information flow-based graph cuts of the dual graph of the social networks. Experiments conducted with the Enron email dataset and the political blog dataset from Dailykos show the proposed event detection approach outperforms the other alternatives.|Qiankun Zhao,Prasenjit Mitra,Bi Chen","66152|AAAI|2007|Mobile Service for Reputation Extraction from Weblogs - Public Experiment and Evaluation|In this paper, we introduce a mobile service that extracts reputations of a product from weblogs by cellular phones during shopping.

First, compared to current ad-hoc composition using, e.g., Perl or C++, Datalog provides a cleaner and more powerful way to compose small extraction modules into larger programs. Thus, writing IE programs this way retains and enhances the important advantages of current approaches programs are easy to understand, debug, and modify. Second, once we write IE programs in this framework, we can apply query optimization techniques to them. This gives programs that, when run over a variety of data sets, are more efficient than any monolithic program because they are optimized based on the statistics of the data on which they are invoked. We show how optimizing such programs raises challenges specific to text data that cannot be accommodated in the current relational optimization framework, then provide initial solutions. Extensive experiments over real-world data demonstrate that optimization is indeed vital for IE programs and that we can effectively optimize IE programs written in this proposed framework.|Warren Shen,AnHai Doan,Jeffrey F.

The first challenge of Wikipedia is to make the encyclopedia machine-processable. In this study, we address the problem of extracting relations among entities from Wikipedia's English articles, which in turn can serve for intelligent systems to satisfy users' information needs. Our proposed method first anchors the appearance of entities in Wikipedia articles using some heuristic rules that are supported by their encyclopedic style. Therefore, it uses neither the Named Entity Recognizer (NER) nor the Coreference Resolution tool, which are sources of errors for relation extraction. It then classifies the relationships among entity pairs using SVM with features extracted from the web structure and subtrees mined from the syntactic structure of text. The innovations behind our work are the following a) our method makes use of Wikipedia characteristics for entity allocation and entity classification, which are essential for relation extraction b) our algorithm extracts a core tree, which accurately reflects a relationship between a given entity pair, and subsequently identifies key features with respect to the relationship from the core tree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through evaluation of manually annotated data from actual Wikipedia articles.|Dat P. T.

However, existing approaches suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks (i) The information loss metrics are counter-intuitive and fail to capture data inaccuracies inflicted for the sake of privacy. (ii) l-diversity is solved by techniques developed for the simpler k-anonymity problem, which introduces unnecessary inaccuracies. (iii) The anonymization process is inefficient in terms of computation and IO cost. In this paper we propose a framework for efficient privacy preservation that addresses these deficiencies. First, we focus on one-dimensional (i.e., single attribute) quasi-identifiers, and study the properties of optimal solutions for k-anonymity and l-diversity, based on meaningful information loss metrics. Guided by these properties, we develop efficient heuristics to solve the one-dimensional problems in linear time. Finally, we generalize our solutions to multi-dimensional quasi-identifiers using space-mapping techniques. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that our techniques clearly outperform the state-of-the-art, in terms of execution time and information loss.|Gabriel Ghinita,Panagiotis Karras,Panos Kalnis,Nikos Mamoulis","80721|VLDB|2006|Automatic Extraction of Dynamic Record Sections From Search Engine Result Pages|A search engine returned result page may contain search results that are organized into multiple dynamically generated sections in response to a user query.

Traditionally, information extraction proceeds by first segmenting each candidate record separately, and then merging records that refer to the same entities. While computationally efficient, this approach is suboptimal, because it ignores the fact that segmenting one candidate record can help to segment similar ones. For example, resolving a well-segmented field with a less-clear one can disambiguate the latter's boundaries. In this paper we propose a joint approach to information extraction, where segmentation of all records and entity resolution are performed together in a single integrated inference process. While a number of previous authors have taken steps in this direction (eg., Pasula et al. (), Wellner et al. ()), to our knowledge this is the first fully joint approach. In experiments on the CiteSeer and Cora citation matching datasets, joint inference improved accuracy, and our approach outperformed previous ones. Further, by using Markov logic and the existing algorithms for it, our solution consisted mainly of writing the appropriate logical formulas, and required much less engineering than previous ones.|Hoifung Poon,Pedro Domingos","65826|AAAI|2006|Phoebus A System for Extracting and Integrating Data from Unstructured and Ungrammatical Sources|With the proliferation of online classifieds and auctions comes a new need to meaningfully search and organize the items for sale.

This work generally assumes that the size of the market (number of bidders) is known a priori, but that the mechanism designer has no knowledge of the distribution of bid values. However, in many real-world applications (such as online ticket sales), the opposite is true the seller has distributional knowledge of the bid values (e.g., via the history of past transactions in the market), but there is uncertainty about market size. Adopting the perspective of automated mechanism design, introduced by Conitzer and Sandholm, we develop algorithms that compute an optimal, or approximately optimal, online auction mechanism given access to this distributional knowledge. Our main results are twofold. First, we show that when the seller does not know the market size, no constant-approximation to the optimum efficiency or revenue is achievable in the worst case, even under the very strong assumption that bid values are i.i.d. samples from a distribution known to the seller. Second, we show that when the seller has distributional knowledge of the market size as well as the bid values, one can do well in several senses. Perhaps most interestingly, by combining dynamic programming with prophet inequalities (a technique from optimal stopping theory) we are able to design and analyze online mechanisms which are temporally strategyproof (even with respect to arrival and departure times) and approximately efficiency (revenue)-maximizing. In exploring the interplay between automated mechanism design and prophet inequalities, we prove new prophet inequalities motivated by the auction setting.|Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi,Robert D.

In this work, we study the automated design of mechanisms that only require partial revelation of utilities. Each agent's type space is partitioned into a finite set of partial types, and agents (should) report the partial type within which their full type lies. We provide a set of optimization routines that can be combined to address the trade-offs between the amount of communication, approximation of incentive properties, and objective value achieved by a mechanism. This allows for the automated design of partial revelation mechanisms with worst-case guarantees on incentive properties for any objective function (revenue, social welfare, etc.).|Nathanael Hyafil,Craig Boutilier","66141|AAAI|2007|An Architecture for Adaptive Algorithmic Hybrids|We describe a cognitive architecture for creating more robust intelligent systems by executing hybrids of algorithms based on different computational formalisms.

For such content-modeling purposes, transformation of numeric data into symbols and the modeling of resulting symbolic sequences can be achieved using statistical models---Markov Chains (MCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We consider the problem of distributed indexing and semantic querying over such sensor models. Specifically, we are interested in efficiently answering (i) range queries return all sensors that have observed an unusual sequence of symbols with a high likelihood, (ii) top- queries return the sensor that has the maximum probability of observing a given sequence, and (iii) -NN queries return the sensor (model) which is most similar to a query model. All the above queries can be answered at the centralized base station, if each sensor transmits its model to the base station. However, this is communication-intensive. We present a much more efficient alternative---a distributed index structure, MIST (Model-based Index STructure), and accompanying algorithms for answering the above queries. MIST aggregates two or more constituent models into a single composite model, and constructs an in-network hierarchy over such composite models. We develop two kinds of composite models the first kind captures the average behavior of the underlying models and the second kind captures the extreme behaviors of the underlying models. Using the index parameters maintained at the root of a subtree, we bound the probability of observation of a query sequence from a sensor in the subtree. We also bound the distance of a query model to a sensor model using these parameters. Extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the MIST schemes scale well in terms of network size and number of model states. We also show its superior performance over the centralized schemes in terms of update, query, and total communication costs.|Arnab Bhattacharya,Anand Meka,Ambuj K.

We propose two methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns, as well as fluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing only updates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the shared execution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections.

It is well known that the answer to the question depends on the structure of the causal Bayesian network, the set of observable variables, the set of effect variables, and the set of intervention variables. Our work is based on the work of Tian, Pearl, Huang, and Valtorta (Tian & Pearl a b  Huang & Valtorta a) and extends it.

Since the online Dijkstra's algorithm has been shown to be efficient only for short distances, we propose an efficient index, called distance signature, for distance computation and query processing over long distances. Distance signature discretizes the distances between objects and network nodes into categories and then encodes these categories. To minimize the storage and search costs, we present the optimal category partition, and the encoding and compression algorithms for the signatures, based on a simplified network topology. By mathematical analysis and experimental study, we showed that the signature index is efficient and robust for various data distributions, query workloads, parameter settings and network updates.|Haibo Hu,Dik Lun Lee,Victor C.

In experiments, we systematically increase the connectivity of bipartite Bayesian networks, and find that clique tree size growth is well-approximated by Gompertz growth curves. This research improves the understanding of the scaling behavior of clique tree clustering, provides a foundation for benchmarking and developing improved BN inference algorithms, and presents an aid for analytical trade-off studies of tree clustering using growth curves.|Ole J.

However, when continuous variables are present in Bayesian networks, their dependence relationships could be nonlinear and their probability distributions could be arbitrary. So far no efficient inference algorithm could deal with this case except Monte Carlo simulation methods such as Likelihood Weighting. But with unlikely evidence, simulation methods could be very slow to converge. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximate inference algorithm called Unscented Message Passing (UMP-BN) for Bayesian networks with arbitrary continuous variables. UMP-BN combines unscented transformation - a deterministic sampling method, and Pearl's message passing algorithm to provide the estimates of the first two moments of the posterior distributions. We test this algorithm with several networks including the ones with nonlinear andor non-Gaussian variables. The numerical experiments show that UMP-BN converges very fast and produces promising results.|Wei Sun,Kuo-Chu Chang"],["65967|AAAI|2007|Using Multiresolution Learning for Transfer in Image Classification|Our work explores the transfer of knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction to improve learning.

To explore this question, we have extended previous work on how children and robots learn to play hide and seek to a human-robot team covertly approaching a moving target. We used the cognitive modeling system, ACT-R, with an added spatial module to support the robot's spatial reasoning. The robot interacted with a team member through voice, gestures, and movement during the team's covert approach of a moving target.

The semantic object hierarchy in WordNet grounds this ill-posed segmentation problem, so that true boundaries are defined as edges between instances of different classes, and all other edges are clutter. To avoid fully classifying each pixel, which is very difficult in generic images, we evaluate the semantic similarity of the two regions bounding each edge in an initial oversegmentation. Semantic similarity is computed using WordNet enhanced with appearance information, and is largely orthogonal to visual similarity. Hence two regions with very similar visual attributes, but from different categories, can have a large semantic distance and therefore evidence of a strong boundary between them, and vice versa. The ontology is trained with images from the UC Berkeley image segmentation benchmark, extended with manual labeling of the semantic content of each image segment. Results on boundary detection against the benchmark images show that semantic similarity computed through WordNet can significantly improve boundary detection compared to generic segmentation.|Anthony Hoogs,Roderic Collins","65828|AAAI|2006|Intuitive linguistic Joint Object Reference in Human-Robot Interaction Human Spatial Reference Systems and Function-Based Categorization for Symbol Grounding|The visionary goal of an easy to use service robot implies intuitive styles of interaction between humans and robots. Such natural interaction can only be achieved if means are found to bridge the gap between the forms of object perception and spatial knowledge maintained by such robots, and the forms of language, used by humans, to communicate such knowledge. Part of bridging this gap consists of allowing user and robot to establish joint reference on objects in the environment - without forcing the user to use unnatural means for object reference. We present an approach to establishing joint object reference which makes use of natural object classification and a computational model of basic intrinsic and relative reference systems. Our object recognition approach assigns natural categories (e.g. \"desk\", \"chair\", \"table\") to new objects based on their functional design. With basic objects within the environment classified, we can then make use of a computational reference model, to process natural projective relations (e.g. \"the briefcase to the left of the chair\"), allowing users to refer to objects which cannot be classified reliably by the recognition system alone.|Reinhard Moratz","65779|AAAI|2006|Object-Sorting-by-Color in a Variety of Lighting Conditions Using Neural Networks and Lego Mindstorms Robot|Recognizing object color in a variety of lighting conditions is a challenging area of pattern-recognition.

Interactive Web search divides the search process into several rounds, and for each round the search engine interacts with the user for more knowledge of the user's information requirement. Previous research mainly uses the text information on Web pages, while little attention is paid to other modalities. This article shows that Web search performance can be significantly improved if imagery is considered in interactive Web search. Compared with text, imagery has its own advantage the time for &ldquoreading&rdquo an image is as little as that for reading one or two words, while the information brought by an image is as much as that conveyed by a whole passage of text. In order to exploit the advantages of imagery, a novel interactive Web search framework is proposed, where image snippets are first extracted from Web pages and then provided, along with the text snippets, to the user for result presentation and relevance feedback, as well as being presented alone to the user for image suggestion. User studies show that it is more convenient for the user to identify the Web pages he or she expects and to reformulate the initial query. Further experiments demonstrate the promise of introducing multimodal techniques into the proposed interactive Web search framework.|Xiao-Bing Xue,Zhi-Hua Zhou,Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang","65987|AAAI|2007|Fish Inspection System using a Parallel Neural Network Chip and Image Knowledge Builder Application|A generic image learning system, CogniSight, is being used for the inspection of fishes before filleting off-shore.

Other work has focused on point objects whose location is not precisely known and is typically described using a probability distribution. In this paper, we present a new technique for modeling and querying vague spatial objects. Using shapelets, an image decomposition technique developed in astronomy, as base data type, we introduce a comprehensive set of low-level operations that provide building blocks for versatile high-level operations on vague spatial objects. In addition, we describe an implementation of this data model as an extension to PostgreSQL, including an indexing technique for shapelet objects. Unlike existing techniques for modeling and querying vague or fuzzy data, our approach is optimized for localized, smoothly varying spatial objects, and as such is more suitable for many real-world datasets.|Daniel Zinn,Jim Bosch,Michael Gertz"],["65985|AAAI|2007|A Modal Logic for Beliefs and Pro Attitudes|Agents' pro attitudes such as goals, intentions, desires, wishes, and judgements of satisfactoriness play an important role in how agents act rationally. To provide a natural and satisfying formalization of these attitudes is a longstanding problem in the community of agent theory. Most of existing modal logic approaches are based on Kripke structures and have to face the so-called side-effect problem. This paper presents a new modal logic formalizing agents' pro attitudes, based on neighborhood models. There are three distinguishing features of this logic. Firstly, this logic naturally satisfies Bratman's requirements for agents' beliefs and pro attitudes, as well as some interesting properties that have not been discussed before. Secondly, we give a sound and complete axiom system for characterizing all the valid properties of beliefs and pro attitudes. We introduce for the first time the notion of linear neighborhood frame for obtaining the semantic model, and this brings a new member to the family of non-normal modal logics. Finally, we argue that the present logic satisfies an important requirement proposed from the viewpoint of computation, that is, computational grounding, which means that properties in this logic can be given an interpretation in terms of some concrete computational model. Indeed, the presented neighborhood frame can be naturally derived from probabilistic programming with utilities.|Kaile Su,Abdul Sattar,Han Lin,Mark Reynolds","66179|AAAI|2007|Probabilistic Modal Logic|A modal logic is any logic for handling modalities concepts like possibility, necessity, and knowledge.

In this paper we provide a formal system that represents probabilistic knowledge about probabilistic knowledge. We also present exact and approximate algorithms for reasoning about the truth value of queries that are encoded as probabilistic modal logic formulas. We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model. Then, we introduce an approximate method for applications in which we have very many or infinitely many states. Exact methods are impractical in these applications and we show that our method returns a close estimate efficiently.|Afsaneh Shirazi,Eyal Amir","65822|AAAI|2006|Finding Maximally Satisfiable Terminologies for the Description Logic ALC|For ontologies represented as Description Logic Tboxes, optimised DL reasoners are able to detect logical errors, but there is comparatively limited support for resolving such problems. One possible remedy is to weaken the available information to the extent that the errors disappear, but to limit the weakening process as much as possible. The most obvious way to do so is to remove just enough Tbox sentences to eliminate the errors. In this paper we propose a tableau-like procedure for finding maximally concept-satisfiable terminologies represented in the description logic ALC. We discuss some optimisation techniques, and report on preliminary, but encouraging, experimental results.|Thomas Andreas Meyer,Kevin Lee,Richard Booth,Jeff Z.

Such a knowledge base is constituted by two components, called TBox and ABox. The former expresses general knowledge about the concepts and their relationships, whereas the latter describes the state of affairs regarding the instances of concepts. We investigate the case where the update affects only the instance level of the ontology, i.e., the ABox. Building on classical approaches on knowledge base update, our first contribution is to provide a general semantics for instance level update in Description Logics. We then focus on DL-Lite, a specific Description Logic where the basic reasoning tasks are computationally tractable. We show that DL-Lite is closed with respect to instance level update, in the sense that the result of an update is always expressible as a new DL-Lite ABox. Finally we provide an algorithm that computes the result of an update in DL-Lite, and we show that it runs in polynomial time with respect to the size of both the original knowledge base and the update formula.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Antonella Poggi,Riccardo Rosati","66034|AAAI|2007|Generality and Equivalence Relations in Default Logic|Generality or refinement relations between different theories have important applications to generalization in inductive logic programming, refinement of ontologies, and coordination in multi-agent systems. We study generality relations in disjunctive default logic by comparing the amounts of information brought by default theories. Intuitively, a default theory is considered more general than another default theory if the former brings more information than the latter. Using techniques in domain theory, we introduce different types of generality relations over default theories. We show that generality relations based on the Smyth and Hoare orderings reflect orderings on skeptical and credulous consequences, respectively, and that two default theories are equivalent if and only if they are equally general under these orderings. These results naturally extend both generality relations over first-order theories and those for answer set programming.|Katsumi Inoue,Chiaki Sakama","65774|AAAI|2006|Towards an Axiom System for Default Logic|Recently, Lakemeyer and Levesque proposed a logic of only-knowing which precisely captures three forms of nonmonotonic reasoning Moore's Autoepistemic Logic, Konolige's variant based on moderately grounded expansions, and Reiter's default logic. Defaults have a uniform representation under all three interpretations in the new logic. Moreover, the logic itself is monotonic, that is, nonmonotonic reasoning is cast in terms of validity in the classical sense. While Lakemeyer and Levesque gave a model-theoretic account of their logic, a proof-theoretic characterization remained open. This paper fills that gap for the propositional subset a sound and complete axiom system in the new logic for all three varieties of default reasoning. We also present formal derivations for some examples of default reasoning. Finally we present evidence that it is unlikely that a complete axiom system exists in the first-order case, even when restricted to the simplest forms of default reasoning.|Gerhard Lakemeyer,Hector J.

We provide a coupling between the method for computing trust values in social networks and the prioritized Reiter defaults of (Baader & Hollunder ), where specificity of terminological concepts is used to prioritize defaults. We compare our approach with specificity-based prioritization, and discuss how the two can be combined.

These approaches generalize the fixpoint-based and the level mapping based answer set semantics of normal logic programs to the case of logic programs with arbitrary types of c-atoms. The results are four different answer set definitions which are equivalent when applied to normal logic programs. The standard fixpoint-based semantics of logic programs is generalized in two directions, called answer set by reduct and answer set by complement. These definitions, which differ from each other in the treatment of negation-as-failure (naf) atoms, make use of an immediate consequence operator to perform answer set checking, whose definition relies on the notion of conditional satisfaction of c-atoms w.r.t. a pair of interpretations. The other two definitions, called strongly and weakly well-supported models, are generalizations of the notion of well-supported models of normal logic programs to the case of programs with c-atoms. As for the case of fixpoint-based semantics, the difference between these two definitions is rooted in the treatment of naf atoms. We prove that answer sets by reduct (resp. by complement) are equivalent to weakly (resp. strongly) well-supported models of a program, thus generalizing the theorem on the correspondence between stable models and well-supported models of a normal logic program to the class of programs with c-atoms. We show that the newly defined semantics coincide with previously introduced semantics for logic programs with monotone c-atoms, and they extend the original answer set semantics of normal logic programs. We also study some properties of answer sets of programs with c-atoms, and relate our definitions to several semantics for logic programs with aggregates presented in the literature.|Tran Cao Son,Enrico Pontelli,Phan Huy Tu"],["66052|AAAI|2007|TeamTalk A Platform for Multi-Human-Robot Dialog Research in Coherent Real and Virtual Spaces|Performing experiments with human-robot interfaces often requires the allocation of expensive and complex hardware and large physical spaces.
