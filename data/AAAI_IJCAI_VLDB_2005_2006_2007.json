IRL is motivated by situations where knowledge of the rewards is a goal by itself (as in preference elicitation) and by the task of apprenticeship learning (learning policies from an expert). In this paper we show how to combine prior knowledge and evidence from the expert's actions to derive a probability distribution over the space of reward functions. We present efficient algorithms that find solutions for the reward learning and apprenticeship learning tasks that generalize well over these distributions.

However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction. Simple examples are given in order to show the advantages of the algorithm.|Marc G.

Sequence of value representations Vn are processed iteratively by Vn+  ATVn where T is the Bellman operator and A an approximation operator. Bounds on the error between the performance of the policies induced by the algorithm and the optimal policy are given as a function of weighted Lp-norms (p  ) of the approximation errors. The results extend usual analysis in L-norm, and allow to relate the performance of AVI to the approximation power (usually expressed in Lp-norm, for p   or ) of the SL algorithm. We illustrate the tightness of these bounds on an optimal replacement problem.|Rémi Munos","16313|IJCAI|2005|Temporal-Difference Networks with History|Temporal-difference (TD) networks are a formalism for expressing and learning grounded world knowledge in a predictive form Sutton and Tanner, . However, not all partially observable Markov decision processes can be efficiently learned with TD networks. In this paper, we extend TD networks by allowing the network-update process (answer network) to depend on the recent history of previous actions and observations rather than only on the most recent action and observation. We show that this extension enables the solution of a larger class of problems than can be solved by the original TD networks or by history-based methods alone. In addition, we apply TD networks to a problem that, while still simple, is significantly larger than has previously been considered. We show that history-extended TD networks can learn much of the common-sense knowledge of an egocentric gridworld domain with a single bit of perception.|Brian Tanner,Richard S.

Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","16190|IJCAI|2005|An MCMC Approach to Solving Hybrid Factored MDPs|Hybrid approximate linear programming (HALP) has recently emerged as a promising framework for solving large factored Markov decision processes (MDPs) with discrete and continuous state and action variables. Our work addresses its major computational bottleneck - constraint satisfaction in large structured domains of discrete and continuous variables. We analyze this problem and propose a novelMarkov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC) method for finding the most violated constraint of a relaxed HALP. This method does not require the discretization of continuous variables, searches the space of constraints intelligently based on the structure of factored MDPs, and its space complexity is linear in the number of variables. We test the method on a set of large control problems and demonstrate improvements over alternative approaches.|Branislav Kveton,Milos Hauskrecht","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world. The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","66064|AAAI|2007|Optimizing Anthrax Outbreak Detection Using Reinforcement Learning|The potentially catastrophic impact of a bioterrorist attack makes developing effective detection methods essential for public health. In the case of anthrax attack, a delay of hours in making a right decision can lead to hundreds of lives lost. Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision. We present empirical evidence illustrating that the performance of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and timeliness is improved significantly by utilizing POMDPs.|Masoumeh T.

After motivating this formulation, we show how to convert a traditional MDP into a TTD-MDP. We derive an algorithm for finding non-deterministic policies by constructing a trajectory tree that allows us to compute locally-consistent policies. We specify the necessary conditions for solving the problem exactly and present a heuristic algorithm for constructing policies when an exact answer is impossible or impractical.

However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted. Based on the semi-MDP (sMDP) model, we study the hard constrained (HC) problem in continuous time, state and action spaces with respect to both finite and infinite horizons, and various cost criteria. We show that the HCsMDP problem is NP-hard and that there exists an equivalent discrete-time MDP to every HCsMDP. Hence, classical methods such as reinforcement learning can solve HCsMDPs.|Wai-Leong Yeow,Chen-Khong Tham,Wai-Choong Wong"],["66179|AAAI|2007|Probabilistic Modal Logic|A modal logic is any logic for handling modalities concepts like possibility, necessity, and knowledge. Artificial intelligence uses modal logics most heavily to represent and reason about knowledge of agents about others' knowledge. This type of reasoning occurs in dialog, collaboration, and competition. In many applications it is also important to be able to reason about the probability of beliefs and events. In this paper we provide a formal system that represents probabilistic knowledge about probabilistic knowledge. We also present exact and approximate algorithms for reasoning about the truth value of queries that are encoded as probabilistic modal logic formulas. We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model. Then, we introduce an approximate method for applications in which we have very many or infinitely many states. Exact methods are impractical in these applications and we show that our method returns a close estimate efficiently.|Afsaneh Shirazi,Eyal Amir","65692|AAAI|2006|Unifying Logical and Statistical AI|Intelligent agents must be able to handle the complexity and uncertainty of the real world.

Inference algorithms for Markov logic draw on ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo and knowledge-based model construction. Learning algorithms are based on the voted perceptron, pseudo-likelihood and inductive logic programming.

Among the approaches dealing with uncertainty, the one by Bacchus, Halpern and Levesque, which uses the situation calculus, is perhaps the most expressive. However, there are still some open issues. For example, it remains unclear what an agent's knowledge base would actually look like. The formalism also requires second-order logic to represent uncertain beliefs, yet a first-order representation clearly seems preferable. In this paper we show how these issues can be addressed by incorporating noisy sensors and actions into an existing logic of only-knowing.|Alfredo Gabaldon,Gerhard Lakemeyer","65469|AAAI|2005|Description Logic-Ground Knowledge Integration and Management|This abstract describes ongoing work in developing large-scale knowledge repositories.

We show that the regression operator in this framework can be defined similarly to regression in the Reiter's version of the situation calculus. Using this new regression operator, we show that the projection and executability problems are decidable in the modified version even if an initial knowledge base is incomplete and open. For an incomplete knowledge base and for context-dependent actions, we consider a type of progression that is sound with respect to the classical progression. We show that the new knowledge base resulting after our progression is definable in our modified situation calculus if one allows actions with local effects only.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

This allowed us to develop a clean and workable semantics for the language without piggybacking on the generic Tarski semantics for first-order logic. In this paper, we reconsider the relation between ES and the situation calculus and show how to map sentences of ES into the situation calculus. We argue that the fragment of the situation calculus represented by ES is rich enough to handle the basic action theories defined by Reiter as well as Golog. Finally, we show that in the full second-order version of ES, almost all of the situation calculus can be accommodated.|Gerhard Lakemeyer,Hector J.

However, as we begin creating autonomous agents to operate in the rich environments of modern videogames and computer simulations, it becomes important to devise agent behaviors that display the visible attributes of intelligence, rather than simply performing optimally. Such visibly intelligent behavior is difficult to specify with rules or characterize in terms of quantifiable objective functions, but it is possible to utilize human intuitions to directly guide a learning system toward the desired sorts of behavior. Policy induction from human-generated examples is a promising approach to training such agents. In this paper, such a method is developed and tested using Lamarckian neuroevolution. Artificial neural networks are evolved to control autonomous agents in a strategy game. The evolution is guided by human-generated examples of play, and the system effectively learns the policies that were used by the player to generate the examples. I.e., the agents learn visibly intelligent behavior. In the future, such methods are likely to play a central rule in creating autonomous agents for complex environments, making it possible to generate rich behaviors derived from nothing more formal than the intuitively generated example, of designers, players, or subject-matter experts.|Bobby D.

One way of dealing with the uncertain and dynamic nature of such environments is to endow agents with the ability to modify the agent social network by autonomously adapting their local connectivity structure.

This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","66158|AAAI|2007|Interest-Matching Comparisons using CP-nets|The formation of internet-based social networks has revived research on traditional social network models as well as interest-matching, or match-making, systems.

It has been shown in the literature that the point of convergence and motion of a swarm of autonomous mobile agents can be controlled by using cyclic pursuit laws. In cyclic pursuit, there exists a predefined cyclic connection between agents and each agent pursues the next agent in the cycle. In this paper we generalize this idea to a case where an agent pursues a point which is the weighted average of the positions of the remaining agents. This point correspond to a particular pursuit sequence. Using this concept of centroidal cyclic pursuit, the behavior of the agents is analyzed such that, by suitably selecting the agents' gain, the rendezvous point of the agents can be controlled, directed linear motion of the agents can be achieved, and the trajectories of the agents can be changed by switching between the pursuit sequences keeping some of the behaviors of the agents invariant.

In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

We then verify the classifier's predictions by invoking the service with some sample data of that type. Once we discover correct classification, we invoke the service to produce output data samples. We then use content-based classifiers to recognize semantic types of the output data.

Unfortunately, current search engines cannot effectively rank those relational data, which exists on dynamic websites supported by online databases. In this study, to rank such structured data (i.e., find the \"best\" items), we propose an integrated online system consisting of compressed data structure to encode the dominant relationship of the relational data.

With millions of queries being submitted to search engines every day, it is both important and beneficial to mine the knowledge hidden in the queries and their intended Web pages. We can use this information in various ways, such as providing query suggestions and organizing the queries.

Experimental results have shown this approach can achieve significant improvements in performance compared with the traditional SAT and CSP approaches. In this paper, we follow a different route, developing SAT solvers that can automatically recognise CSP structure hidden in SAT encodings. This allows us to look more closely at how constraint weighting can be implemented in the SAT and CSP domains. Our experimental results show that a SAT-based approach to handle weights, together with CSP-based approach to variable instantiation, is superior to other combinations of SAT and CSP-based approaches.

Our first strategy uses additional binary variables for the CSP, and applies an XOR or parity constraint based method introduced previously for Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. In the CSP framework, in addition to the naive individual filtering of XOR constraints used in SAT, we are able to apply a global domain filtering algorithm by viewing these constraints as a collection of linear equalities over the field of two elements. Our most promising strategy extends this approach further to larger domains, and applies the so-called generalized XOR constraints directly to CSP variables. This allows us to reap the benefits of the compact and structured representation that CSPs offer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our counting framework through experimental comparisons with the solution enumeration approach (which, we believe, is the current best generic solution counting method for CSPs), and with solution counting in the context of SAT and integer programming.|Carla P.

Here, a knowledge base is written in either first-order logic or nonmonotonic logic programming. In this work, we will give two definitions of abductive equivalence. The first one, explainable equivalence, requires that two abductive programs have the same explainability for any observation. Another one, explanatory equivalence, guarantees that any observation has exactly the same explanations in each abductive framework. Explanatory equivalence is a stronger notion than explainable equivalence. In first-order abduction, explainable equivalence can be verified by the notion of extensional equivalence in default theories. In nonmonotonic logic programs, explanatory equivalence can be checked by means of the notion of relative strong equivalence.

A global agreement about the trustworthiness value of these users cannot exist.

However, as we begin creating autonomous agents to operate in the rich environments of modern videogames and computer simulations, it becomes important to devise agent behaviors that display the visible attributes of intelligence, rather than simply performing optimally. Such visibly intelligent behavior is difficult to specify with rules or characterize in terms of quantifiable objective functions, but it is possible to utilize human intuitions to directly guide a learning system toward the desired sorts of behavior. Policy induction from human-generated examples is a promising approach to training such agents. In this paper, such a method is developed and tested using Lamarckian neuroevolution. Artificial neural networks are evolved to control autonomous agents in a strategy game. The evolution is guided by human-generated examples of play, and the system effectively learns the policies that were used by the player to generate the examples. I.e., the agents learn visibly intelligent behavior. In the future, such methods are likely to play a central rule in creating autonomous agents for complex environments, making it possible to generate rich behaviors derived from nothing more formal than the intuitively generated example, of designers, players, or subject-matter experts.|Bobby D.

However, in real-world environments, a user often has multiple goals that are concurrently carried out, and a single action can serve as a common step towards multiple goals. In this paper, we formulate the multiple-goal recognition problem and exemplify it in an indoor environment where an RF-based wireless network is available.

What is relevant are the capacities of the agent what the agent is both able and empowered to do with that information. We show how concepts of legal agency and attribution of knowledge gained by agents to their principals are crucial to understanding whether a violation of privacy has occurred when artificial agents access users' personal data. As natural language processing and semantic extraction used in artificial agents become increasingly sophisticated, so the corporations that deploy those agents will be more likely to be attributed with knowledge of their users' personal information, thus triggering significant potential legal liabilities.|Samir Chopra,Laurence White","16078|IJCAI|2005|Attribution of Knowledge to Artificial Agents and their Principals|We consider the problem of attribution of knowledge to artificial agents and their legal principals.

An important criterion for assessing the quality of an allocation of resources, in terms of fairness, is envy-freeness an agent is said to envy another agent if it would prefer to swap places with that other agent. We analyse under what circumstances a sequence of deals respecting the negotiation topology may be expected to converge to a state where no agent envies any of the agents it is directly connected to. We also analyse the computational complexity of a related decision problem, namely the problem of checking whether a given negotiation state admits any deal that would both be beneficial to every agent involved and reduce envy in the agent society.|Yann Chevaleyre,Ulrich Endriss,Nicolas Maudet","65566|AAAI|2005|OAR A Formal Framework for Multi-Agent Negotiation|In Multi-Agent systems, agents often need to make decisions about how to interact with each other when negotiating over task allocation.

The traditional categorization of self-interested and cooperative agents is unified by adopting a utility view. We illustrate mathematically that the degree of cooperativeness of an agent and the degree of its selfdirectness are not directly related.

One way of accomplishing learning is to observe past outcomes, using such information to improve future decisions. When limits in agents' memory or observation capabilities are assumed, one must decide on how large should the observation window be. We investigate how this decision influences both agents' and system's performance in the context of a special class of distributed resource allocation problems, namely dispersion games. We show by numerical experiments over a specific dispersion game (the Minority Game) that in such scenario an agent's performance is non-monotonically correlated with her memory size when all other agents are kept unchanged.

Recently, it is also used for multi-instance (MI) learning by employing a kernel that is defined directly on the bags. As only the bags (but not the instances) have known labels, this MI kernel implicitly assumes all instances in the bag to be equally important. However, a fundamental property of MI learning is that not all instances in a positive bag necessarily belong to the positive class, and thus different instances in the same bag should have different contributions to the kernel. In this paper, we address this instance label ambiguity by using the method of marginalized kernels. It first assumes that all the instance labels are available and defines a label-dependent kernel on the instances. By integrating out the unknown instance labels, a marginalized kernel defined on the bags can then be obtained. A desirable property is that this kernel weights the instance pairs by the consistencies of their probabilistic instance labels. Experiments on both classification and regression data sets show that this marginalized MI kernel, when used in a standard SVM, performs consistently better than the original MI kernel. It also outperforms a number of traditional MI learning methods.|James T.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design.

We built supervised and unsupervised classifiers for the task and demonstrate that the supervised methods arc superior to a number of baselines and also a benchmark state-of-the-art WSD system.

The BP-QL language is based on an intuitive model of business processes, an abstraction of the emerging BPEL (business process execution language) standard. It allows users to query business processes visually, in a manner very analogous to how such processes are typically specified, and can be employed in a distributed setting, where process components may be provided by distinct providers. We describe here the query language as well as its underlying formal model. We consider the properties of the various language components and explain how they influenced the language design. In particular we distinguish features that can be efficiently supported, and those that incur a prohibitively high cost, or cannot be computed at all.

Because in many practical cases, sets of assignments can be represented implicitly and compactly using symbolic techniques such as decision diagrams, the set-based algorithm can compute bounds faster than explicitly searching over individual assignments, while memory explosion can be avoided by limiting the size of the sets. Varying the size of the sets yields a family of algorithms that includes known search and inference algorithms as special cases.

In addition. the algorithm is not tied to CP-nets, but can work with any preference formalism which produces a preorder over the outcomes. We also propose an approximation method which weakens the preference ordering induced by the CP-net, returning a larger set of outcomes, but provides a significant computational advantage. Finally, we describe a weighted constraint approach that allows to find good solutions even when optimals do not exist.|Steven David Prestwich,Francesca Rossi,Kristen Brent Venable,Toby Walsh","65728|AAAI|2006|Analysis of Privacy Loss in Distributed Constraint Optimization|Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) is rapidly emerging as a prominent technique for multi agent coordination. However, despite agent privacy being a key motivation for applying DCOPs in many applications, rigorous quantitative evaluations of privacy loss in DCOP algorithms have been lacking. Recently, Maheswaran et al.  introduced a framework for quantitative evaluations of privacy in DCOP algorithms, showing that some DCOP algorithms lose more privacy than purely centralized approaches and questioning the motivation for applying DCOPs. This paper addresses the question of whether state-of-the art DCOP algorithms suffer from a similar shortcoming by investigating several of the most efficient DCOP algorithms, including both DPOP and ADOPT. Furthermore, while previous work investigated the impact on efficiency of distributed contraint reasoning design decisions (e.g. constraint-graph topology, asynchrony, message-contents), this paper examines the privacy aspect of such decisions, providing an improved understanding of privacy-efficiency tradeoffs.|Rachel Greenstadt,Jonathan P.

ODPOP has several advantages over DPOP. First, it uses messages whose size only grows linearly with the treewidth of the problem. Second, by letting agents explore values in a best-first order, it avoids incurring always the worst case complexity as DPOP, and on average it saves a significant amount of computation and information exchange.

The previous state-of-the-art system achieves temporal preference optimization using a SAT formulation, with its creators attributing its performance to advances in SAT solving techniques. We depart from the SAT encoding and instead introduce the Valued DTP (VDTP). In contrast to the traditional semiring-based formalism that annotates legal tuples of a constraint with preferences, our framework instead assigns elementary costs to the constraints themselves. After proving that the VDTP can express the same set of utilitarian optimal solutions as the DTPP with piecewise-constant preference functions, we develop a method for achieving weighted constraint satisfaction within a meta-CSP search space that has traditionally been used to solve DTPs without preferences. This allows us to directly incorporate several powerful techniques developed in previous decision-based DTP literature. Finally, we present empirical results demonstrating that an implementation of our approach consistently outperforms the SAT-based solver by orders of magnitude.|Michael D. Moffitt,Martha E.

This similarity is due to the fact that conditional probabilities have the same functional form in both Bayesian and Markov networks, which turns out to be the more influential factor.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16248|IJCAI|2005|Algebraic Markov Decision Processes|In this paper, we provide an algebraic approach to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which allows a unified treatment of MDPs and includes many existing models (quantitative or qualitative) as particular cases.

This paper considers transfer learning with Markov logic networks (MLNs), a powerful formalism for learning in relational domains. We present a complete MLN transfer system that first autonomously maps the predicates in the source MLN to the target domain and then revises the mapped structure to further improve its accuracy. Our results in several real-world domains demonstrate that our approach successfully reduces the amount of time and training data needed to learn an accurate model of a target domain over learning from scratch.|Lilyana Mihalkova,Tuyen N.

In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal. Our experimental results show that TVI outperforms VI, LAO, LRTDP and HDP on our benchmark MDPs.|Peng Dai,Judy Goldsmith","66010|AAAI|2007|A Unification of Extensive-Form Games and Markov Decision Processes|We describe a generalization of extensive-form games that greatly increases representational power while still allowing efficient computation in the zero-sum setting. A principal feature of our generalization is that it places arbitrary convex optimization problems at decision nodes, in place of the finite action sets typically considered. The possibly-infinite action sets mean we must \"forget\" the exact action taken (feasible solution to the optimization problem), remembering instead only some statistic sufficient for playing the rest of the game optimally. Our new model provides an exponentially smaller representation for some games in particular, we show how to compactly represent (and solve) extensive-form games with outcome uncertainty and a generalization of Markov decision processes to multi-stage adversarial planning games.|H.

Artificial intelligence algorithms offer the capability to improve the performance or sensor networks in dynamic environments by minimizing energy utilization while not compromising overall performance. However, they have been used only to a limited extent in sensor networks primarily due to their expensive computing requirements. We describe the use of Markov decision processes for the adaptive control of sensor sampling rates in a sensor network used for human health monitoring. The MDP controller is designed to gather optimal information about the patient's health while guaranteeing a minimum lifetime of the system. At every control step, the MDP controller varies the frequency at which the data is collected according to the criticality of the patient's health at that time. We present a stochastic model that is used to generate the optimal policy offline. In cases where a model of the observed process is not available a-priori. we descrihe a Q-learning technique to learn the control policy, by using a pre-existing master controller. Simulation results that illustrate the performance of the controller are presented.|Anand Panangadan,Syed Muhammad Ali,Ashit Talukder","16759|IJCAI|2007|Using Linear Programming for Bayesian Exploration in Markov Decision Processes|A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge. Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming. We illustrate this approach on a few domains and compare it with other exploration algorithms.|Pablo Samuel Castro,Doina Precup","65933|AAAI|2006|Hard Constrained Semi-Markov Decision Processes|In multiple criteria Markov Decision Processes (MDP) where multiple costs are incurred at every decision point, current methods solve them by minimising the expected primary cost criterion while constraining the expectations of other cost criteria to some critical values. However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted. Based on the semi-MDP (sMDP) model, we study the hard constrained (HC) problem in continuous time, state and action spaces with respect to both finite and infinite horizons, and various cost criteria. We show that the HCsMDP problem is NP-hard and that there exists an equivalent discrete-time MDP to every HCsMDP. Hence, classical methods such as reinforcement learning can solve HCsMDPs.|Wai-Leong Yeow,Chen-Khong Tham,Wai-Choong Wong"],["16230|IJCAI|2005|Networked Distributed POMDPs A Synergy of Distributed Constraint Optimization and POMDPs|In many real-world multiagent applications such as distributed sensor nets, a network of agents is formed based on each agent's limited interactions with a small number of neighbors.

However, despite agent privacy being a key motivation for applying DCOPs in many applications, rigorous quantitative evaluations of privacy loss in DCOP algorithms have been lacking. Recently, Maheswaran et al.  introduced a framework for quantitative evaluations of privacy in DCOP algorithms, showing that some DCOP algorithms lose more privacy than purely centralized approaches and questioning the motivation for applying DCOPs. This paper addresses the question of whether state-of-the art DCOP algorithms suffer from a similar shortcoming by investigating several of the most efficient DCOP algorithms, including both DPOP and ADOPT. Furthermore, while previous work investigated the impact on efficiency of distributed contraint reasoning design decisions (e.g. constraint-graph topology, asynchrony, message-contents), this paper examines the privacy aspect of such decisions, providing an improved understanding of privacy-efficiency tradeoffs.|Rachel Greenstadt,Jonathan P.

ODPOP has several advantages over DPOP. First, it uses messages whose size only grows linearly with the treewidth of the problem. Second, by letting agents explore values in a best-first order, it avoids incurring always the worst case complexity as DPOP, and on average it saves a significant amount of computation and information exchange.

The previous state-of-the-art system achieves temporal preference optimization using a SAT formulation, with its creators attributing its performance to advances in SAT solving techniques. We depart from the SAT encoding and instead introduce the Valued DTP (VDTP). In contrast to the traditional semiring-based formalism that annotates legal tuples of a constraint with preferences, our framework instead assigns elementary costs to the constraints themselves. After proving that the VDTP can express the same set of utilitarian optimal solutions as the DTPP with piecewise-constant preference functions, we develop a method for achieving weighted constraint satisfaction within a meta-CSP search space that has traditionally been used to solve DTPs without preferences. This allows us to directly incorporate several powerful techniques developed in previous decision-based DTP literature. Finally, we present empirical results demonstrating that an implementation of our approach consistently outperforms the SAT-based solver by orders of magnitude.|Michael D. Moffitt,Martha E.

Recent advances in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have made use of the quickly spreading nature of these attacks to identify them with high sensitivity and at low false positive (FP) rates. However, slowly propagating attacks are much more difficult to detect because they are cloaked under the veil of normal network traffic, yet can be just as dangerous due to their exponential spread pattern. We extend the idea of using collaborative IDSs to corroborate the likelihood of attack by imbuing end hosts with probabilistic graphical models and using random messaging to gossip state among peer detectors. We show that such a system is able to boost a weak anomaly detector D to detect an order-of-magnitude slower worm, at false positive rates less than a few per week, than would be possible using D alone at the end-host or on a network aggregation point. We show that this general architecture is scalable in the sense that a fixed absolute false positive rate can be achieved as the network size grows, spreads communication bandwidth uniformly throughout the network, and makes use of the increased computation power of a distributed system. We argue that using probabilistic models provides more robust detections than previous collaborative counting schemes and allows the system to account for heterogeneous detectors in a principled fashion.|Denver Dash,Branislav Kveton,John Mark Agosta,Eve M.

It is therefore of utmost importance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate schemas from sets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on the inference of Document Type Definitions (DTDs for short), we will consider the inference of XML Schema Definitions (XSDs for short) --- the increasingly popular schema formalism that is turning DTDs obsolete. In contrast to DTDs where the content model of an element depends only on the element's name, the content model in an XSD can also depend on the context in which the element is used. Hence, while the inference of DTDs basically reduces to the inference of regular expressions from sets of sample strings, the inference of XSDs also entails identifying from a corpus of sample documents the contexts in which elements bear different content models. Since a seminal result by Gold implies that no inference algorithm can learn the complete class of XSDs from positive examples only, we focus on a class of XSDs that captures most XSDs occurring in practice. For this class, we provide a theoretically complete algorithm that always infers the correct XSD when a sufficiently large corpus of XML documents is available. In addition, we present a variant of this algorithm that works well on real-world (and therefore incomplete) data sets.|Geert Jan Bex,Frank Neven,Stijn Vansummeren","80557|VLDB|2005|Mapping Maintenance for Data Integration Systems|To answer user queries, a data integration system employs a set of semantic mappings between the mediated schema and the schemas of data sources. In dynamic environments sources often undergo changes that invalidate the mappings. Hence, once the system is deployed, the administrator must monitor it over time, to detect and repair broken mappings. Today such continuous monitoring is extremely labor intensive, and poses a key bottleneck to the widespread deployment of data integration systems in practice.We describe MAVERIC, an automatic solution to detecting broken mappings. At the heart of MAVERIC is a set of computationally inexpensive modules called sensors, which capture salient characteristics of data sources (e.g., value distributions, HTML layout properties). We describe how MAVERIC trains and deploys the sensors to detect broken mappings. Next we develop three novel improvements perturbation (i.e., injecting artificial changes into the sources) and multi-source training to improve detection accuracy, and filtering to further reduce the number of false alarms. Experiments over  real-world sources in six domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our sensor-based approach over existing solutions, as well as the utility of our improvements.|Robert McCann,Bedoor K.

The Loadstar system introduces load shedding techniques to classifying multiple data streams of large volume and high speed. Loadstar uses a novel metric known as the quality of decision (QoD) to measure the level of uncertainty in classification. Resources are then allocated to sources where uncertainty is high. To make optimum classification decisions and accurate QoD measurement, Loadstar relies on feature prediction to model the data dropped by the load shedding mechanism. Furthermore, Loadstar is able to adapt to the changing data characteristics in data streams. The system thus offers a nice solution to data mining with resource constraints.|Yun Chi,Haixun Wang,Philip S.

When a user submits a query to a search engine and clicks on the returned Web pages, the user's understanding of the query as well as its relation to the Web pages is encoded in the clickthrough data. With millions of queries being submitted to search engines every day, it is both important and beneficial to mine the knowledge hidden in the queries and their intended Web pages. We can use this information in various ways, such as providing query suggestions and organizing the queries. In this paper, we plan to exploit the knowledge hidden in clickthrough logs by constructing query hierarchies, which can reflect the relationship among queries. Our proposed method consists of two stages generating candidate queries and determining \"generalizationspecialization\" relatinns between these queries in a hierarchy. We test our method on some labeled data sets and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution empirically.|Dou Shen,Min Qin,Weizhu Chen,Qiang Yang,Zheng Chen","16454|IJCAI|2007|On Mining Closed Sets in Multi-Relational Data|We investigate the problem of mining closed sets in multi-relational databases. Previous work introduced different semantics and associated algorithms for mining closed sets in multirelational databases. However, insight into the implications of semantic choices and the relationships among them was still lacking. Our investigation shows that the semantic choices are important because they imply different properties, which in turn affect the range of algorithms that can mine for such sets. Of particular interest is the question whether the seminal LCM algorithm by Uno et al. can be upgraded towards multi-relational problems. LCM is attractive since its run time is linear in the number of closed sets and it does not need to store outputs in order to avoid duplicates. We provide a positive answer to this question for some of the semantic choices, and report on experiments that evaluate the scalability and applicability of the upgraded algorithm on benchmark problems.|Gemma C.

The architecture should generate communication and dialogue during the performance of collaborative multi-agent tasks as a byproduct of the agent's rationally pursuing its intentions. This paper describes how a joint intention interpreter that is integrated with a reasoner over beliefs and communicative acts can form the core of a dialogue engine. As an interpreter of joint actions, the architecture enables agent programmers to describe a domain declaratively, specifying an agent's individual and joint intentions, plans and actions at a high level. The interpreter attempts to fulfill the agent's individual and joint intentions, subject to its beliefs and mutual beliefs. As a consequence, the system engages in dialogue through the planning and execution of communicative acts necessary to attain the collaborative task at hand. The dialogue engine is general enough to be applicable to both agent-agent and agent-human teams. The system has been implemented in a combination of Java and Prolog, and can be shown to obey the predictions of joint intention.|Rajah Annamalai Subramanian,Sanjeev Kumar,Philip R.

It provides a way for compiling a stratified belief base in order to be able to process inference from it in polynomial time. The resulting extra compilation cost is very low. In particular, the number of additional variables, that are added to original stratified bases, corresponds exactly to the number of priority levels existing in the base.

The latter are, respectively, a quantity of strong agreement which measures the amount of information on which two belief bases \"totally\" agree, and a quantity of weak agreement which measures the amount of information that is believed by one source but is unknown to the other. All three quantity measures are based on the weighted prime implicant, which represents beliefs in a prioritized belief base. We then define a degree of conflict and two degrees of agreement based on our quantity of conflict and the quantities of agreement.

Of particular interest is the way in which new beliefs are acquired and determined and old beliefs are retained or discarded. A parallel can be drawn to symbolic machine learning approaches where examples to be categorised are presented to the learning system and a theory is subsequently derived, usually over a number of iterations. It is therefore not surprising that the term 'theory revision' is used to describe this process Ourston and Mooney, . Viewing a machine learning system as a rational reasoner allows us to begin seeing these seemingly disparate mechanisms in a similar light. In this paper we are concerned with characterising the well known inverse resolution operations Muggleton,   (and more recently, inverse entailment Muggleton, ) as AGM-style belief change operations. In particular, our account is based on the abductive expansion operation Pagnucco et al.,  Pagnucco,  and characterised by using the notion of epistemic entrenchment Grdenfors and Makinson,  extended for this operation. This work provides a basis for reconciling work in symbolic machine learning and belief revision.

As such, epistemic logics have been employed for the verification of cryptographic protocols. Although this approach to verification is explicitly concerned with changing beliefs, formal belief change operators have not been incorporated in previous work. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to protocol verification by combining a monotonic logic with a non-monotonic belief change operator. In this context, a protocol participant is able to retract beliefs in response to new information and a protocol participant is able to postulate the most plausible event explaining new information. We illustrate that this kind of reasoning is particularly important when protocol participants have incorrect beliefs.|Aaron Hunter,James P.

In this paper we provide a technique for accomplishing this objective. Our technique can deal with a rich class of preferences, including so-called temporally extended preferences (TEPs). Unlike simple preferences which express desired properties of the final state achieved by a plan, TEPs can express desired properties of the entire sequence of states traversed by a plan, allowing the user to express a much richer set of preferences. Our technique involves converting a planning problem with TEPs into an equivalent planning problem containing only simple preferences. This conversion is accomplished by augmenting the inputed planning domain with a new set of predicates and actions for updating these predicates. We then provide a collection of new heuristics and a specialized search algorithm that can guide the planner towards preferred plans. Under some fairly general conditions our method is able to find a most preferred plan-i.e., an optimal plan. It can accomplish this without having to resort to admissible heuristics, which often perform poorly in practice. Nor does our technique require an assumption of restricted plan length or make-span. We have implemented our approach in the HPlan-P planning system and used it to compete in the th International Planning Competition, where it achieved distinguished performance in the Qualitative Preferences track.|Jorge A.

The success of such search typically depends on heuristic distance-to-the-goal estimates derived from the plangraph. Such estimates are effective in guiding search for many domains, but there remain many other domains where current heuristics are inadequate to guide forward search effectively. In some of these domains, it is possible to learn reactive policies from example plans that solve many problems. However, due to the inductive nature of these learning techniques, the policies are often faulty, and fail to achieve high success rates. In this work, we consider how to effectively integrate imperfect learned policies with imperfect heuristics in order to improve over each alone. We propose a simple approach that uses the policy to augment the states expanded during each search step. In particular, during each search node expansion, we add not only its neighbors, but all the nodes along the trajectory followed by the policy from the node until some horizon.

Viewing software components as web services, the current solutions to web services composition based on business web services (using WSDL, BPEL, SOAP etc.) or semantic web services (using ontologies, goal-directed reasoning etc.) are both piecemeal and insufficient for building practical applications.

Indeed, even the notion of optimal plan is far from trivial, since plans in nondeterministic domains can result in several different behaviors satisfying conditions with different preferences. Planning for optimal conditional plans must therefore take into account the different behaviors, and conditionally search for the highest preference that can be achieved. In this paper, we address this problem. We formalize the notion of optimal conditional plan, and we describe a correct and complete planning algorithm that is guaranteed to find optimal solutions.

The resulting system, SATPLAN(P) is competitive with SGPLAN, the winning system in the category \"simple preferences\" at the last IPC. Further, we show that SATPLAN(P) performances are (almost) always comparable to those of SATPLAN when solving the same problems without preferences in other words, introducing simple preferences in SATPLAN does not affect its performances. This latter result is due both to the particular mechanism we use in order to incorporate preferences in SAT-PLAN and to the relative low number of soft goals (each corresponding to a simple preference) usually present in planning problems. Indeed, if we consider the issue of determining minimal plans (corresponding to problems with thousands of preferences) the performances of SATPLAN(P) are comparable to those of SATPLAN in many cases, but can be significantly worse when the number of preferences is very high compared to the total number of variables in the problem.

Indeed, decision-epoch planners won the International Planning Competition's Temporal Planning Track in ,  and .

Neuroscientific studies suggest that controlled and automatic processing rely on two largely distinct neural pathways. The controlled pathway, which includes the prefrontal cortex, is seen as acquiring declarative representations of skills. In comparison, the automatic pathway is thought to develop procedural representations. Automaticity in motor skill learning involves a reduction in dependence on frontal systems and an increased reliance on the automatic pathway. In this paper, we propose a biologically plausible computational model of motor skill automaticity. This model offers a dual-pathway neurocomputational account of the translation of declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge during motor learning. In support of the model, we review some previously reported human experimental results involving the learning of a sequential key pressing task, and we demonstrate, through simulation, howthe model provides a parsimonious explanation for these results.|Ashish Gupta,David C. Noelle"],["66207|AAAI|2007|An Integrated Development Environment and Architecture for Soar-Based Agents|It is well known how challenging is the task of coding complex agents for virtual environments. This difficulty in developing and maintaining complex agents has been plaguing commercial applications of advanced agent technology in virtual environments. In this paper, we discuss development of a commercial-grade integrated development environment (IDE) and agent architecture for simulation and training in a high-fidelity virtual environment. Specifically, we focus on two key areas of contribution. First, we discuss the addition of an explicit recipe mechanism to Soar, allowing reflection. Second, we discuss the development and usage of an IDE for building agents using our architecture the approach we take is to tightly-couple the IDE to the architecture. The result is a complete development and deployment environment for agents situated in a complex dynamic virtual world.|Ari Yakir,Gal A.

Our approach, called SHAPEBUGS, generates a consensus coordinate system by agents continually performing local trilaterations, and achieves shape formation by simultaneously allowing agents to disperse within the defined D shape using a Contained Gas Model. This approach has several novel features () agents can easily aggregate into arbitrary user-specified shapes, using a formation process that is independent of the number of agents () the system automatically adapts to influx and death of agents, as well as accidental displacement. We show that the consensus coordinate system is robust and provides reasonable accuracy in the face of significant sensor and movement error.|Jimming Cheng,Winston Cheng,Radhika Nagpal","65969|AAAI|2007|The Marchitecture A Cognitive Architecture for a Robot Baby|The Marchitecture is a cognitive architecture for autonomous development of representations. The goals of The Marchitecture are domain independence, operating in the absence of knowledge engineering, learning an ontology of parameterized relational concepts, and elegance of design. To this end, The Marchitecture integrates classification, parsing, reasoning, and explanation. The Marchitecture assumes an ample amount of raw data to develop its representations, and it is therefore appropriate for long lived agents.|Marc Pickett,Tim Oates","65669|AAAI|2006|Multimodal Cognitive Architecture Making Perception More Central to Intelligent Behavior|I propose that the notion of cognitive state be broadened from the current predicate-symbolic, Language-of-Thought framework to a multi-modal one, where perception and kinesthetic modalities participate in thinking. In contrast to the roles assigned to perception and motor activities as modules external to central cognition in the currently dominant theories in AI and Cognitive Science, in the proposed approach, central cognition incorporates parts of the perceptual machinery. I motivate and describe the proposal schematically, and describe the implementation of a bi-modal version in which a diagrammatic representation component is added to the cognitive state. The proposal explains our rich multimodal internal experience, and can be a key step in the realization of embodied agents. The proposed multimodal cognitive state can significantly enhance the agent's problem solving.|B. Chandrasekaran","66270|AAAI|2007|Dominance and Equivalence for Sensor-Based Agents|This paper describes recent results from the robotics community that develop a theory, similar in spirit to the theory of computation, for analyzing sensor-based agent systems. The central element to this work is a notion of dominance of one such system over another. This relation is formally based on the agents' progression through a derived information space, but may informally be understood as describing one agent's ability to \"simulate\" another. We present some basic properties of this dominance relation and demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to a basic problem in robotics. We argue that this work is of interest to a broad audience of artificial intelligence researchers for two main reasons. First, it calls attention to the possibility of studying belief spaces in way that generalizes both probabilistic and nondeterministic uncertainty models. Second, it provides a means for evaluating the information that an agent is able to acquire (via its sensors and via conformant actions), independent of any optimality criterion and of the task to be completed.|Jason M. O'Kane,Steven M. LaValle","66121|AAAI|2007|A Logic of Emotions for Intelligent Agents|This paper formalizes a well-known psychological model of emotions in an agent specification language. This is done by introducing a logical language and its semantics that are used to specify an agent model in terms of mental attitudes including emotions. We show that our formalization renders a number of intuitive and plausible properties of emotions. We also show how this formalization can be used to specify the effect of emotions on an agent's decision making process. Ultimately, the emotions in this model function as heuristics as they constrain an agent's model.|Bas R. Steunebrink,Mehdi Dastani,John-Jules Ch.

Results show that user-motivated critiques were more frequently applied and the example critiquing system employing only this type of critiques achieved the best results. In particular, the example critiquing agent significantly improves users' decision accuracy with less cognitive effort consumed than the dynamic critiquing recommender with system-proposed critiques. Additionally, the former is more likely to inspire users' confidence of their choice and promote their intention to purchase and return to the agent for future use.|Li Chen,Pearl Pu","65839|AAAI|2006|Learning of Agents with Limited Resources|In our research we investigate rational agent which consciously balances deliberation and acting, and uses learning to augment its reasoning. It creates several partial plans, uses past experience to choose the best one and, by executing it, gams new Knowledge about the world. We analyse a possible application of Inductive Logic Programming to learn how to evaluate partial plans in a resource-constrained way. We also discuss how ILP framework can generalise partial plans.|Slawomir Nowaczyk","65587|AAAI|2005|Observation-based Model for BDI-Agents|We present a new computational model of BDI-agents, called the observation-based BDI-model. The key point of this BDI-model is to express agents' beliefs, desires and intentions as a set of runs (computing paths), which is exactly a system in the interpreted system model, a well-known agent model due to Halpern and his colleagues. Our BDI-model is computationally grounded in that we are able to associate the BDI-agent model with a computer program, and formulas, involving agents' beliefs, desires (goals) and intentions, can be understood as properties of program computations. We present a sound and complete proof system with respect to our BDI-model and explore how symbolic model checking techniques can be applied to model checking BDI-agents. In order to make our BDI-model more flexible and practically realistic, we generalize it so that agents can have multiple sources of beliefs, goals and intentions.|Kaile Su,Abdul Sattar,Kewen Wang,Xiangyu Luo,Guido Governatori,Vineet Padmanabhan","65777|AAAI|2006|A Unified Cognitive Architecture for Physical Agents|In this paper we describe ICARUS, a cognitive architecture for physical agents that integrates ideas from a number of traditions, but that has been especially influenced by results from cognitive psychology. We review ICARUS' commitments to memories and representations, then present its basic processes for performance and learning. We illustrate the architecture's behavior on a task from in-city driving that requires interaction among its various components. In addition, we discuss ICARUS' consistency with qualitative findings about the nature of human cognition. In closing, we consider the framework's relation to other cognitive architectures that have been proposed in the literature.|Pat Langley,Dongkyu Choi"]]}}
