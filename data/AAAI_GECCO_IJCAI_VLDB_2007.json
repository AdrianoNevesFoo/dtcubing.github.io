However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction. Simple examples are given in order to show the advantages of the algorithm.|Marc G.

A lot of effort has been made to develop approximate offline algorithms to solve ever larger POMDPs. However, even state-of-the-art approaches fail to solve large POMDPs in reasonable time. Recent developments in online POMDP search suggest that combining offline computations with online computations is often more efficient and can also considerably reduce the error made by approximate policies computed offline. In the same vein, we propose a new anytime online search algorithm which seeks to minimize, as efficiently as possible, the error made by an approximate value function computed offline. In addition, we show how previous online computations can be reused in following time steps in order to prevent redundant computations. Our preliminary results indicate that our approach is able to tackle large state space and observation space efficiently and under real-time constraints.|St√©phane Ross,Brahim Chaib-draa","66123|AAAI|2007|Continuous State POMDPs for Object Manipulation Tasks|My research focus is on using continuous state partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to perform object manipulation tasks using a robotic arm. During object manipulation, object dynamics can be extremely complex, non-linear and challenging to specify. To avoid modeling the full complexity of possible dynamics. I instead use a model which switches between a discrete number of simple dynamics models. By learning these models and extending Porta's continuous state POMDP framework (Porta et at. ) to incorporate this switching dynamics model, we hope to handle tasks that involve absolute and relative dynamics within a single framework. This dynamics model may be applicable not only to object manipulation tasks, but also to a number of other problems, such as robot navigation. By using an explicit model of uncertainty, I hope to create solutions to object manipulation tasks that more robustly handle the noisy sensory information received by physical robots.|Emma Brunskill","66222|AAAI|2007|Scaling Up Solving POMDPs through Value Based Clustering|Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide an appropriately rich model for agents operating under partial knowledge of the environment.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16565|IJCAI|2007|Towards Efficient Computation of Error Bounded Solutions in POMDPs Expected Value Approximation and Dynamic Disjunctive Beliefs|While POMDPs (partially observable markov decision problems) are a popular computational model with wide-ranging applications, the computational cost for optimal policy generation is prohibitive. Researchers are investigating ever-more efficient algorithms, yet many applications demand such algorithms bound any loss in policy quality when chasing efficiency. To address this challenge, we present two new techniques. The first approximates in the value space to obtain solutions efficiently for a pre-specified error bound. Unlike existing techniques, our technique guarantees the resulting policy will meet this bound. Furthermore, it does not require costly computations to determine the quality loss of the policy. Our second technique prunes large tracts of belief space that are unreachable, allowing faster policy computation without any sacrifice in optimality. The combination of the two techniques, which are complementary to existing optimal policy generation algorithms, provides solutions with tight error bounds efficiently in domains where competing algorithms fail to provide such tight bounds.|Pradeep Varakantham,Rajiv T.

Situated dialog is characterized by its deep connection to the embedding context, and the precise cross-timing of linguistic and non-linguistic actions. This paper describes initial research into the construction of an SCA that engages in dialog about collaborative physical tasks, in which agents engage in dialog with the joint goal of manipulating the physical context in some manner. Constructing an SCA that can interact naturally in such tasks requires an agent with the ability to interleave planning, action, and observation while operating in a partially observable environment. Consequently, I propose to model an SCA as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).|William Thompson","66064|AAAI|2007|Optimizing Anthrax Outbreak Detection Using Reinforcement Learning|The potentially catastrophic impact of a bioterrorist attack makes developing effective detection methods essential for public health. In the case of anthrax attack, a delay of hours in making a right decision can lead to hundreds of lives lost. Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision. We present empirical evidence illustrating that the performance of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and timeliness is improved significantly by utilizing POMDPs.|Masoumeh T.

One approach that effectively addresses the intractable memory requirements of POMDP algorithms is based on representing POMDP policies as finite-state controllers. In this paper, we illustrate some fundamental disadvantages of existing techniques that use controllers. We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques.

We argue that this work is of interest to a broad audience of artificial intelligence researchers for two main reasons. First, it calls attention to the possibility of studying belief spaces in way that generalizes both probabilistic and nondeterministic uncertainty models.

For ambiguous queries, a traditional approach is to organize search results into groups (clusters), one for each meaning of the query. These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate. Combined with a content-driven Web page clustering technique, our heuristic search system significantly improves the clustering results.|Ron Bekkerman,Shlomo Zilberstein,James Allan","66210|AAAI|2007|Approximating OWL-DL Ontologies|Efficient query answering over ontologies is one of the most useful and important services to support Semantic Web applications.

In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) of the time series, the similarity search over directly indexed time series usually encounters a serious problem, known as the \"dimensionality curse\". Thus, many dimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing the dimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods, only Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries, which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initial studies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods, however, show that PLA performs no worse than others. Motivated by this, in this paper, we re-investigate PLA for approximating and indexing time series. Specifically, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced PLA-space, and prove that this function indeed results in a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original time series, which can lead to no false dismissals during the similarity search. As a second step, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds to improve the search efficiency. Our extensive experiments over a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data sets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of PLA together with the newly proposed lower bound distance, in terms of both pruning power and wall clock time, compared with two state-of-the-art reduction methods, Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA) and Chebyshev Polynomials (CP).|Qiuxia Chen,Lei Chen 0002,Xiang Lian,Yunhao Liu,Jeffrey Xu Yu","80730|VLDB|2007|Probabilistic Graphical Models and their Role in Databases|Probabilistic graphical models provide a framework for compact representation and efficient reasoning about the joint probability distribution of several interdependent variables.

With this tutorial, we are aiming to provide a foundational overview of probabilistic graphical models to the database community, accompanied by a brief overview of some of the recent research literature on the role of graphical models in databases.|Amol Deshpande,Sunita Sarawagi","16726|IJCAI|2007|Combining Learning and Word Sense Disambiguation for Intelligent User Profiling|Understanding user interests from text documents can provide support to personalized information recommendation services. Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16413|IJCAI|2007|Word Sense Disambiguation through Sememe Labeling|Currently most word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems are relatively individual word sense experts. Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model. Syntactic and hypernym features can enhance the performance significantly.|Xiangyu Duan,Jun Zhao,Bo Xu","16784|IJCAI|2007|A Flexible Unsupervised PP-Attachment Method Using Semantic Information|In this paper we revisit the classical NLP problem of prepositional phrase attachment (PP-attachment). Given the pattern V -NP-P-NP in the text, where V is verb, NP is a noun phrase, P is the preposition and NP is the other noun phrase, the question asked is where does P - NP attach V or NP This question is typically answered using both the word and the world knowledge. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution. Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach. The unambiguous V - P - N and N - P -N tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N - P - N tuples of the test corpus. A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation (WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of Vs and Ns in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP, NP - P - NP. For experimentation, Brown Corpus provides the training data andWall Street Journal Corpus the test data. The accuracy obtained for PP-attachment resolution is close to %. The novelty of the system lies in the flexible use of WSD and DSR phases.|Srinivas Medimi,Pushpak Bhattacharyya","16349|IJCAI|2007|A Subspace Kernel for Nonlinear Feature Extraction|Kernel based nonlinear Feature Extraction (KFE) or dimensionality reduction is a widely used preprocessing step in pattern classification and data mining tasks. Given a positive definite kernel function, it is well known that the input data are implicitly mapped to a feature space with usually very high dimensionality. The goal of KFE is to find a low dimensional subspace of this feature space, which retains most of the information needed for classification or data analysis. In this paper, we propose a subspace kernel based on which the feature extraction problem is transformed to a kernel parameter learning problem. The key observation is that when projecting data into a low dimensional subspace of the feature space, the parameters that are used for describing this subspace can be regarded as the parameters of the kernel function between the projected data. Therefore current kernel parameter learning methods can be adapted to optimize this parameterized kernel function. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.|Mingrui Wu,Jason D. R.

To disambiguate word sense, we combine the one sense per collocation heuristic with the grammatical role of polysemous nouns and analysis of word sense combinatories.

On the other hand, evolutionary computational technique is characterized as a soft computing learning method with its roots in the theory of evolution. During the past decade, SVM has been commonly used as a classifier for various applications. The evolutionary computation has also attracted a lot of attention in pattern recognition and has shown significant performance improvement on a variety of applications. However, there has been no comparison of the two methods. In this paper, first we propose an improvement of a coevolutionary computational classification algorithm, called Improved Coevolutionary Feature Synthesized EM (I-CFS-EM) algorithm. It is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. It requires less labeled data and it makes the test in a lower dimension, which speeds up the testing. Then, we provide a comprehensive comparison between SVM with different kernel functions and I-CFS-EM on several real datasets. This comparison shows that I-CFS-EM outperforms SVM in the sense of both the classification performance and the computational efficiency in the testing phase.

Recent developments in online POMDP search suggest that combining offline computations with online computations is often more efficient and can also considerably reduce the error made by approximate policies computed offline. In the same vein, we propose a new anytime online search algorithm which seeks to minimize, as efficiently as possible, the error made by an approximate value function computed offline. In addition, we show how previous online computations can be reused in following time steps in order to prevent redundant computations.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16565|IJCAI|2007|Towards Efficient Computation of Error Bounded Solutions in POMDPs Expected Value Approximation and Dynamic Disjunctive Beliefs|While POMDPs (partially observable markov decision problems) are a popular computational model with wide-ranging applications, the computational cost for optimal policy generation is prohibitive. Researchers are investigating ever-more efficient algorithms, yet many applications demand such algorithms bound any loss in policy quality when chasing efficiency. To address this challenge, we present two new techniques. The first approximates in the value space to obtain solutions efficiently for a pre-specified error bound. Unlike existing techniques, our technique guarantees the resulting policy will meet this bound. Furthermore, it does not require costly computations to determine the quality loss of the policy. Our second technique prunes large tracts of belief space that are unreachable, allowing faster policy computation without any sacrifice in optimality. The combination of the two techniques, which are complementary to existing optimal policy generation algorithms, provides solutions with tight error bounds efficiently in domains where competing algorithms fail to provide such tight bounds.|Pradeep Varakantham,Rajiv T.

This paper describes initial research into the construction of an SCA that engages in dialog about collaborative physical tasks, in which agents engage in dialog with the joint goal of manipulating the physical context in some manner. Constructing an SCA that can interact naturally in such tasks requires an agent with the ability to interleave planning, action, and observation while operating in a partially observable environment. Consequently, I propose to model an SCA as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).|William Thompson","66064|AAAI|2007|Optimizing Anthrax Outbreak Detection Using Reinforcement Learning|The potentially catastrophic impact of a bioterrorist attack makes developing effective detection methods essential for public health.

The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision.

We address the problem of how to deal with changes to a Description Logic knowledge base, when these changes affect only its ABox. We consider two types of changes namely update and erasure, and we characterize the semantics of these operations on the basis of the approaches proposed by Winslett and by Katsuno and Mendelzon. It is well known that, in general, Description Logics are not closed with respect to updates, in the sense that the set of models corresponding to an update applied to a knowledge base in a Description Logic L may not be expressible by ABoxes in L. We show that this is true also for erasure. To deal with this problem, we introduce the notion of best approximation of an update (erasure) in a DL L, with the goal of characterizing the L ABoxes that capture the update (erasure) at best. We then focus on DL-LiteF, a tractable Description Logic, and present polynomial algorithms for computing the best approximation of updates and erasures in this logic, which shows that the nice computational properties of DL-LiteF are retained in dealing with the evolution of the ABox.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Antonella Poggi,Riccardo Rosati","80848|VLDB|2007|Reasoning about the Behavior of Semantic Web Services with Concurrent Transaction Logic|The recent upsurge in the interest in Semantic Web services and the high-profile projects such as the WSMO, OWLS, and SWSL, have drawn attention to the importance of logic-based modeling of the behavior of Web services.

Second, queries to the system may be posed with keywords rather than in a structured form. Third, the data from the sources may be extracted using information extraction techniques and so may yield imprecise data. As a first step to building such a system, we introduce the concept of probabilistic schema mappings and analyze their formal foundations. We show that there are two possible semantics for such mappings by-table semantics assumes that there exists a correct mapping but we don't know what it is by-tuple semantics assumes that the correct mapping may depend on the particular tuple in the source data. We present the query complexity and algorithms for answering queries in the presence of approximate schema mappings, and we describe an algorithm for efficiently computing the top-k answers to queries in such a setting.|Xin Luna Dong,Alon Y.

Each peer has a locally controlled and edited database instance, but wants to ask queries over related data from other peers as well. To achieve this, every peer's updates propagate along the mappings to the other peers. However, this update exchange is filtered by trust conditions --- expressing what data and sources a peer judges to be authoritative --- which may cause a peer to reject another's updates. In order to support such filtering, updates carry provenance information. These systems target scientific data sharing applications, and their general principles and architecture have been described in . In this paper we present methods for realizing such systems. Specifically, we extend techniques from data integration, data exchange, and incremental view maintenance to propagate updates along mappings we integrate a novel model for tracking data provenance, such that curators may filter updates based on trust conditions over this provenance we discuss strategies for implementing our techniques in conjunction with an RDBMS and we experimentally demonstrate the viability of our techniques in the ORCHESTRA prototype system.|Todd J.

In sharp contrast to standard information integration architectures, a dataspace management system is a data-coexistence approach it does not require any investments in semantic integration before querying services on the data are provided. Rather, a dataspace can be gradually enhanced over time by defining relationships among the data. Defining those integration semantics gradually is termed pay-as-you-go information integration , as time and effort (pay) are needed over time (go) to provide integration semantics. The benefits are better query results (gain). This paper is the first to explore pay-as-you-go information integration in dataspaces. We provide a technique for declarative pay-as-you-go information integration named iTrails. The core idea of our approach is to declaratively add lightweight 'hints' (trails) to a search engine thus allowing gradual enrichment of loosely integrated data sources. Our experiments confirm that iTrails can be efficiently implemented introducing only little overhead during query execution. At the same time iTrails strongly improves the quality of query results. Furthermore, we present rewriting and pruning techniques that allow us to scale iTrails to tens of thousands of trail definitions with minimal growth in the rewritten query size.|Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles,Jens-Peter Dittrich,Shant Kirakos Karakashian,Olivier Ren√© Girard,Lukas Blunschi","16605|IJCAI|2007|An Adaptive Context-Based Algorithm for Term Weighting Application to Single-Word Question Answering|Term weighting systems are of crucial importance in Information Extraction and Information Retrieval applications.

By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","16649|IJCAI|2007|Dynamic Verification of Trust in Distributed Open Systems|In open and distributed systems, agents must engage in interactions of which they have no previous experience.

However, in resource-constrained systems, indiscriminate communication can create performance bottlenecks by consuming valuable bandwidth. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between the utility attained by communication and its cost. Here we address this tradeoff by developing a novel strategy to make communication selective based on information redundancy ensuring communication only occurs when necessary, while maintaining acceptable coordination. We apply this strategy to a state-of-the-art communication protocol to evaluate its resource saving benefit in a distributed network routing problem. Furthermore, we design a mechanism to adapt its selectivity level to the prevailing resource constraints to ensure further improvements. Empirical studies show our selective strategy achieves relative savings in bandwidth usage of -%, with only a -% relative reduction in coordination effectiveness and the adaptive strategy further improves relative bandwidth usage by up to % and also relative coordination effectiveness by up to % over the non-adaptive approach.|Partha Sarathi Dutta,Claudia V.

Digital certificates are widely used for that purpose. However, practical certification scenarios can be very complex. Each certiticate carries a validity period and can be revoked during this period. Furthermore, the verifying user has to trust the issuers of certificates and revocations. This work presents a formal model which covers these aspects and provides a theoretical foundation for the decision about attribute authenticity even in complex scenarios.

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) using evolution strategies for its optimization problem frequently deliver better results with respect to the optimization criterion and the prediction accuracy. Moreover, evolutionary computation allows for the efficient large margin optimization of a huge family of new kernel functions, namely non-positive semi definite kernels as the Epanechnikov kernel. For these kernel functions, evolutionary SVM even outperform other learning methods like the Relevance Vector Machine. In this paper, we will discuss another major advantage of evolutionary SVM compared to traditional SVM solutions we can explicitly optimize the inherent trade-off between training error and model complexity by embedding multi-objective optimization into the evolutionary SVM. This leads to three advantages first, it is no longer necessary to tune the SVM parameter C which weighs both conflicting criteria. This is a very time-consuming task for traditional SVM. Second, the shape and size of the Pareto front give interesting insights about the complexity of the learning task at hand. Finally, the user can actually see the point where overfitting occurs and can easily select a solution from the Pareto front best suiting his or her needs.|Ingo Mierswa","66151|AAAI|2007|Machine Learning for Automatic Mapping of Planetary Surfaces|We describe an application of machine learning to the problem of geomorphic mapping of planetary surfaces.

We propose and implement a number of extensions to the existing methodology with particular emphasis on the incorporation of machine learning techniques. These extensions result in a robust and practical mapping system that we apply on six sites on Mars. Support Vector Machines show the best mapping results with an accuracy rate of  %. The resultant maps reflect the geomorphology of the sites and have appearance reminiscent of traditional, manually drawn maps.

In the meanwhile, Ensemble Learning, one of the most efficient approaches in supervised Machine Learning for the last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. Ensemble Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only (Off-EEL) or incrementally along evolution (On-EEL). Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that Off-EEL outperforms single-hypothesis evolutionary learning and state-of-art Boosting and generates smaller classifier ensembles.|Christian Gagn√©,Mich√®le Sebag,Marc Schoenauer,Marco Tomassini","58006|GECCO|2007|Support vector regression for classifier prediction|In this paper we introduce XCSF with support vector predictionthe problem of learning the prediction function is solved as a support vector regression problem and each classifier exploits a Support Vector Machine to compute the prediction.

Recently, it is also used for multi-instance (MI) learning by employing a kernel that is defined directly on the bags. As only the bags (but not the instances) have known labels, this MI kernel implicitly assumes all instances in the bag to be equally important. However, a fundamental property of MI learning is that not all instances in a positive bag necessarily belong to the positive class, and thus different instances in the same bag should have different contributions to the kernel. In this paper, we address this instance label ambiguity by using the method of marginalized kernels. It first assumes that all the instance labels are available and defines a label-dependent kernel on the instances. By integrating out the unknown instance labels, a marginalized kernel defined on the bags can then be obtained. A desirable property is that this kernel weights the instance pairs by the consistencies of their probabilistic instance labels. Experiments on both classification and regression data sets show that this marginalized MI kernel, when used in a standard SVM, performs consistently better than the original MI kernel. It also outperforms a number of traditional MI learning methods.|James T.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design. Our contribution is the introduction of a general technique for designing SVM kernels tailored for the classification of sequence data.|Young-In Shin,Donald S.

On the other hand, evolutionary computational technique is characterized as a soft computing learning method with its roots in the theory of evolution. During the past decade, SVM has been commonly used as a classifier for various applications. The evolutionary computation has also attracted a lot of attention in pattern recognition and has shown significant performance improvement on a variety of applications. However, there has been no comparison of the two methods. In this paper, first we propose an improvement of a coevolutionary computational classification algorithm, called Improved Coevolutionary Feature Synthesized EM (I-CFS-EM) algorithm. It is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. It requires less labeled data and it makes the test in a lower dimension, which speeds up the testing. Then, we provide a comprehensive comparison between SVM with different kernel functions and I-CFS-EM on several real datasets. This comparison shows that I-CFS-EM outperforms SVM in the sense of both the classification performance and the computational efficiency in the testing phase.

The approach deals with categorical data, which consists of a set of gene expressionprofiles belonging to one category, and a set belonging to anothercategory. An evolutionary algorithm (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES) is used to learn an ensemble of classification models distinguishing the two categories, based on inputs that are features corresponding to gene expression values. Each feature is associated with a model-based vector, which encodes quantitative information regarding the utilization of the feature across the ensembles of models. Two different ways of constructing these vectors are explored. These model-based vectors are then clustered using a variant of hierarchical clustering called Omniclust. The result is a set of model-based clusters, in which features are gathered together if they are often considered together by classification models -- which may be because they're co-expressed, or may be for subtler reasons involving multi-gene interactions. The method is illustrated by applying it to two datasets regarding human gene expression, one drawn from brain cells and pertinent to the neurogenetics of aging, and the other drawn from blood cells and relating to differentiating between types of lymphoma. We find that, compared to traditional expression-based clustering, the new method often yields clusters that have higher mathematical quality (in the sense of homogeneity and separation) and also yield novel and meaningful insights into the underlying biological processes.|Moshe Looks,Ben Goertzel,L√∫cio de Souza Coelho,Mauricio Mudado,Cassio Pennachin","80772|VLDB|2007|Unifying Data and Domain Knowledge Using Virtual Views|The database community is on a constant quest for better integration of data management and knowledge management.

However, since options are usually learned in the same state space as the problem the agent is solving, they cannot be used in other tasks that are similar but have different state spaces. We introduce the notion of learning options in agentspace, the space generated by a feature set that is present and retains the same semantics across successive problem instances, rather than in problemspace. Agent-space options can be reused in later tasks that share the same agent-space but have different problem-spaces. We present experimental results demonstrating the use of agent-space options in building transferrable skills, and show that they perform best when used in conjunction with problem-space options.|George Konidaris,Andrew G.

These sources can be accessed via web-forms, Web Services or RSS feeds. In order to make automated use of these sources, one needs to first model them semantically. Writing semantic descriptions for web sources is both tedious and error prone. In this paper we investigate the problem of automatically generating such models. We introduce a framework for learning Datalog definitions for web sources, in which we actively invoke sources and compare the data they produce with that of known sources of information. We perform an inductive search through the space of plausible source definitions in order to learn the best possible semantic model for each new source. The paper includes an empirical evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on real-world web sources.|Mark James Carman,Craig A.

In this paper, we investigate some important properties of epistemic logic programs. In particular, we show that Lee and Lifschitz's result on loop formulas for disjunctive logic programs can be extended to a special class of epistemic logic programs. We also study the polysize model property for epistemic logic programs. Based on these discoveries, we identify two non-trivial classes of epistemic logic programs whose consistency checking complexity is reduced from PSPACE-complete to NP-complete and P -complete respectively. We observe that many important applications on epistemic representation fall into these two classes of epistemic logic programs.|Yan Zhang","66162|AAAI|2007|Reasoning about Attribute Authenticity in a Web Environment|The reliable authentication of user attributes is an important prerequisite for the security of web based applications. Digital certificates are widely used for that purpose. However, practical certification scenarios can be very complex.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16753|IJCAI|2007|A Heuristic Search Approach to Planning with Temporally Extended Preferences|Planning with preferences involves not only finding a plan that achieves the goal, it requires finding a preferred plan that achieves the goal, where preferences over plans are specified as part of the planner's input. In this paper we provide a technique for accomplishing this objective. Our technique can deal with a rich class of preferences, including so-called temporally extended preferences (TEPs). Unlike simple preferences which express desired properties of the final state achieved by a plan, TEPs can express desired properties of the entire sequence of states traversed by a plan, allowing the user to express a much richer set of preferences. Our technique involves converting a planning problem with TEPs into an equivalent planning problem containing only simple preferences. This conversion is accomplished by augmenting the inputed planning domain with a new set of predicates and actions for updating these predicates. We then provide a collection of new heuristics and a specialized search algorithm that can guide the planner towards preferred plans. Under some fairly general conditions our method is able to find a most preferred plan-i.e., an optimal plan. It can accomplish this without having to resort to admissible heuristics, which often perform poorly in practice. Nor does our technique require an assumption of restricted plan length or make-span. We have implemented our approach in the HPlan-P planning system and used it to compete in the th International Planning Competition, where it achieved distinguished performance in the Qualitative Preferences track.|Jorge A.

The success of such search typically depends on heuristic distance-to-the-goal estimates derived from the plangraph. Such estimates are effective in guiding search for many domains, but there remain many other domains where current heuristics are inadequate to guide forward search effectively. In some of these domains, it is possible to learn reactive policies from example plans that solve many problems. However, due to the inductive nature of these learning techniques, the policies are often faulty, and fail to achieve high success rates. In this work, we consider how to effectively integrate imperfect learned policies with imperfect heuristics in order to improve over each alone. We propose a simple approach that uses the policy to augment the states expanded during each search step. In particular, during each search node expansion, we add not only its neighbors, but all the nodes along the trajectory followed by the policy from the node until some horizon. Empirical results show that our proposed approach benefits both of the leveraged automated techniques, learning and heuristic search, outperforming the state-of-the-art in most benchmark planning domains.|Sung Wook Yoon,Alan Fern,Robert Givan","16413|IJCAI|2007|Word Sense Disambiguation through Sememe Labeling|Currently most word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems are relatively individual word sense experts. Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

The LaSO approach uses discriminative learning to optimize heuristic functions for search-based computation of structured outputs and has shown promising results in a number of domains. However, the search problems that arise in AI planning tend to be qualitatively very different from those considered in structured classification, which raises a number of potential difficulties in directly applying LaSO to planning. In this paper, we discuss these issues and describe a LaSO-based approach for discriminative learning of beam-search heuristics in AI planning domains. We give convergence results for this approach and present experiments in several benchmark domains.

In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method).

However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method. In addition to that, the threshold ai is also evolved by mutation between i - aisi, i + aisi in every generation in order to obtain as many association rules as possible. The features of the proposed method are as follows compared with other methods ) Extracts rules without identifying frequent itemsets used in Apriori-like mining methods. ) Stores extracted important association rules in a pool all together through generations. ) Measures the significance of associations via the chi-squared test. ) Extracts important rules sufficient enough for user's purpose in a short time. ) The pool is updated in every generation and only important association rules with higher chi-squared value are stored when the identical rules are stored.

Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of  brands in ,  and . Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in . From the simulation results, it is clarified that the trading rules of the proposed method obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method and its effectiveness has been confirmed.|Yan Chen,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","58034|GECCO|2007|Clustering gene expression data via mining ensembles of classification rules evolved using moses|A novel approach, model-based clustering, is described foridentifying complex interactions between genes or gene-categories based on static gene expression data. The approach deals with categorical data, which consists of a set of gene expressionprofiles belonging to one category, and a set belonging to anothercategory. An evolutionary algorithm (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES) is used to learn an ensemble of classification models distinguishing the two categories, based on inputs that are features corresponding to gene expression values. Each feature is associated with a model-based vector, which encodes quantitative information regarding the utilization of the feature across the ensembles of models. Two different ways of constructing these vectors are explored. These model-based vectors are then clustered using a variant of hierarchical clustering called Omniclust. The result is a set of model-based clusters, in which features are gathered together if they are often considered together by classification models -- which may be because they're co-expressed, or may be for subtler reasons involving multi-gene interactions. The method is illustrated by applying it to two datasets regarding human gene expression, one drawn from brain cells and pertinent to the neurogenetics of aging, and the other drawn from blood cells and relating to differentiating between types of lymphoma. We find that, compared to traditional expression-based clustering, the new method often yields clusters that have higher mathematical quality (in the sense of homogeneity and separation) and also yield novel and meaningful insights into the underlying biological processes.|Moshe Looks,Ben Goertzel,L√∫cio de Souza Coelho,Mauricio Mudado,Cassio Pennachin","57997|GECCO|2007|Feature selection and classification in noisy epistatic problems using a hybrid evolutionary approach|A hybrid evolutionary approach is proposed for the combined problem of feature selection (using a genetic algorithm with IntersectionUnion recombination and a fitness function based on a counter-propagation artificial neural network) and subsequent classifier construction (using strongly-typed genetic programming), for use in nonlinear association studies with relatively large potential feature sets and noisy class data.

The first challenge of Wikipedia is to make the encyclopedia machine-processable. In this study, we address the problem of extracting relations among entities from Wikipedia's English articles, which in turn can serve for intelligent systems to satisfy users' information needs. Our proposed method first anchors the appearance of entities in Wikipedia articles using some heuristic rules that are supported by their encyclopedic style. Therefore, it uses neither the Named Entity Recognizer (NER) nor the Coreference Resolution tool, which are sources of errors for relation extraction. It then classifies the relationships among entity pairs using SVM with features extracted from the web structure and subtrees mined from the syntactic structure of text. The innovations behind our work are the following a) our method makes use of Wikipedia characteristics for entity allocation and entity classification, which are essential for relation extraction b) our algorithm extracts a core tree, which accurately reflects a relationship between a given entity pair, and subsequently identifies key features with respect to the relationship from the core tree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through evaluation of manually annotated data from actual Wikipedia articles.|Dat P. T.

In some sense, social text streams are sensors of the real world. Often, it is desirable to extract real world events from the social text streams. However, existing event detection research mainly focused only on the stream properties of social text streams but ignored the contextual, temporal, and social information embedded in the streams. In this paper, we propose to detect events from social text streams by exploring the content as well as the temporal, and social dimensions. We define the term event as the information flow between a group of social actors on a specific topic over a certain time period. We represent social text streams as multi-graphs, where each node represents a social actor and each edge represents the information flow between two actors. The content and temporal associations within the flow of information are embedded in the corresponding edge. Events are detected by combining text based clustering, temporal segmentation, and information flow-based graph cuts of the dual graph of the social networks. Experiments conducted with the Enron email dataset and the political blog dataset from Dailykos show the proposed event detection approach outperforms the other alternatives.|Qiankun Zhao,Prasenjit Mitra,Bi Chen","66134|AAAI|2007|Time-Delay Neural Networks and Independent Component Analysis for EEG-Based Prediction of Epileptic Seizures Propagation|This research focuses on the development of a machine learning technique based on Time-Delay Neural Networks (TDNN) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), to analyze EEG signal dynamics related to the initiation and propagation of epileptic seizures.

However, the development of SANNs has traditionally focused on data domains that are assumed to be modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of data governed by other statistical models, such as the Poisson distribution, has received less attention from the data mining community. Based on special considerations of the statistical nature of data following a Poisson distribution, this paper introduces a SANN, Poisson-based Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (PSOTA), which implements novel similarity matching criteria and neuron weight adaptation schemes. It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood. This study indicate that, in comparison to the traditional Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA), PSOTA offers significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization in data modeled by the Poisson distribution, such as serial analysis of gene expression data.|Haiying Wang,Huiru Zheng,Francisco Azuaje","80799|VLDB|2007|Declarative Information Extraction Using Datalog with Embedded Extraction Predicates|In this paper we argue that developing information extraction (IE) programs using Datalog with embedded procedural extraction predicates is a good way to proceed. First, compared to current ad-hoc composition using, e.g., Perl or C++, Datalog provides a cleaner and more powerful way to compose small extraction modules into larger programs. Thus, writing IE programs this way retains and enhances the important advantages of current approaches programs are easy to understand, debug, and modify. Second, once we write IE programs in this framework, we can apply query optimization techniques to them. This gives programs that, when run over a variety of data sets, are more efficient than any monolithic program because they are optimized based on the statistics of the data on which they are invoked. We show how optimizing such programs raises challenges specific to text data that cannot be accommodated in the current relational optimization framework, then provide initial solutions. Extensive experiments over real-world data demonstrate that optimization is indeed vital for IE programs and that we can effectively optimize IE programs written in this proposed framework.|Warren Shen,AnHai Doan,Jeffrey F.

Knowing how much a user trusts a source can be very useful for aggregating, filtering, and ordering of information. Furthermore, if trust is used to support decision making, it is important to have an accurate estimate of trust when it is not directly available, as well as a measure of confidence in that estimate. This paper describes a new approach that gives an explicit probabilistic interpretation for confidence in social networks. We describe SUNNY, a new trust inference algorithm that uses a probabilistic sampling technique to estimate our confidence in the trust information from some designated sources. SUNNY computes an estimate of trust based on only those information sources with high confidence estimates.

Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables.\" We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than  million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.|Daniel J.

Recently there has been renewed interest in fast propagation algorithms for these constraints. We describe the use of two alternative data structures for maintaining generalised arc consistency on extensional constraints. The first, the Next-Difference list, is novel and has been developed with this application in mind. The second, the trie, is well known but its use in this context is novel. Empirical analyses demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting approaches, both in GAC-schema, and in the watched-literal table constraint in Minion.|Ian P.

In this paper, we introduce a novel training method for CRFs, called virtual evidence boosting, which simultaneously performs feature selection and parameter estimation. To achieve this, we extend standard boosting to handle virtual evidence, where an observation can be specified as a distribution rather than a single number. This extension allows us to develop a unified framework for learning both local and compatibility features in CRFs. In experiments on synthetic data as well as real activity classification problems, our new training algorithm outperforms other training approaches including maximum likelihood, maximum pseudo-likelihood, and the most recent boosted random fields.|Lin Liao,Tanzeem Choudhury,Dieter Fox,Henry A.

Soft arc consistency operations transform a VCSP into an equivalent problem by shifting weights between cost functions. The principal aim is to produce a good lower bound on the cost of solutions, an essential ingredient of a branch and bound search. But soft AC is much more complex than traditional AC there may be several closures (fixpoints) and finding the closure with a maximum lower bound has been shown to be NP-hard for integer costs Cooper and Schiex, . We introduce a relaxed variant of soft arc consistency using rational costs. In this case, an optimal closure can be found in polynomial time. Furthermore, for finite rational costs, the associated lower bound is shown to provide an optimal arc consistent reformulation of the initial problem. Preliminary experiments on random and structured problems are reported, showing the strength of the lower bound produced.|Martin C.

Most supervised methods consider the summarization task as a two-class classification problem and classify each sentence individually without leveraging the relationship among sentences. The unsupervised methods use heuristic rules to select the most informative sentences into a summary directly, which are hard to generalize. In this paper, we present a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) based framework to keep the merits of the above two kinds of approaches while avoiding their disadvantages. What is more, the proposed framework can take the outcomes of previous methods as features and seamlessly integrate them. The key idea of our approach is to treat the summarization task as a sequence labeling problem. In this view, each document is a sequence of sentences and the summarization procedure labels the sentences by  and . The label of a sentence depends on the assignment of labels of others. We compared our proposed approach with eight existing methods on an open benchmark data set. The results show that our approach can improve the performance by more than .% and .% over the best supervised baseline and unsupervised baseline respectively in terms of two popular metrics F and ROUGE-. Detailed analysis of the improvement is presented as well.|Dou Shen,Jian-Tao Sun,Hua Li,Qiang Yang,Zheng Chen","16361|IJCAI|2007|Arc Consistency during Search|Enforcing arc consistency (AC) during search has proven to be a very effective method in solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems and it has been widely-used in many Constraint Programming systems. Although much effort has been made to design efficient standalone AC algorithms, there is no systematic study on how to efficiently enforce AC during search, as far as we know. The significance of the latter is clear given the fact that AC will be enforced millions of times in solving hard problems. In this paper, we propose a framework for enforcing AC during search (ACS) and complexity measurements of ACS algorithms. Based on this framework, several ACS algorithms are designed to take advantage of the residual data left in the data structures by the previous invocation(s) of ACS. The algorithms vary in the worst-case time and space complexity and other complexity measurements. Empirical study shows that some of the new ACS algorithms perform better than the conventional implementation of AC algorithms in a search procedure.|Chavalit Likitvivatanavong,Yuanlin Zhang,Scott Shannon,James Bowen,Eugene C.

The main advantage of the proposed framework is its ability to incorporate a rich set of interactions among the image sites. We achieve this by inducing a hierarchy of hidden variables over the given label field. The proposed tree like structure of our model eliminates the need for a huge parameter space and at the same time permits the use of exact and efficient inference procedures based on belief propagation. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it to two important computer vision tasks, namely image labeling and object detection. The model parameters are trained using the contrastive divergence algorithm.

Due to the wide adoption of graph models, fast containment search of graph data finds many applications in various domains. In comparison to traditional graph search that retrieves all the graphs containing q (q &sube g), containment search has its own indexing characteristics that have not yet been examined. In this paper, we perform a systematic study on these characteristics and propose a contrast subgraph-based indexing model, called cIndex. Contrast subgraphs capture the structure differences between model graphs and query graphs, and are thus perfect for indexing due to their high selectivity. Using a redundancy-aware feature selection process, cIndex can sort out a set of significant and distinctive contrast subgraphs and maximize its indexing capability. We show that it is NP-complete to choose the best set of indexing features, and our greedy algorithm can approximate the one-level optimal index within a ratio of -- e. Taking this solution as a base indexing model, we further extend it to accommodate hierarchical indexing methodologies and apply data space clustering and sampling techniques to reduce the index construction time. The proposed methodology provides a general solution to containment search and indexing, not only for graphs, but also for any data with transitive relations as well. Experimental results on real test data show that cIndex achieves near-optimal pruning power on various containment search workloads, and confirms its obvious advantage over indices built for traditional graph search in this new scenario.|Chen Chen,Xifeng Yan,Philip S.

This is important for applications (e.g., games, simulators, interactive displays) where an agent must behave in a manner that appears human-like. We present a novel technique for learning reactive policies that mimic demonstrated human behavior. The user demonstrates the desired behavior by dictating the agent's actions during an interactive animation. Later, when the agent is to behave autonomously, the recorded data is generalized to form a continuous state-to-action mapping. Combined with an appropriate animation algorithm (e.g., motion capture), the learned policies realize stylized and natural-looking agent behavior. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our technique for quickly producing policies which result in lifelike virtual agent behavior.|Jonathan Dinerstein,Parris K.

In this paper, we propose a general model to partition graphs based on link distributions. This model formulates graph partitioning under a certain distribution assumption as approximating the graph affinity matrix under the corresponding distortion measure. Under this model, we derive a novel graph partitioning algorithm to approximate a graph affinity matrix under various Bregman divergences, which correspond to a large exponential family of distributions. We also establish the connections between edge cut objectives and the proposed model to provide a unified view to graph partitioning.|Bo Long,Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang,Philip S.

As a result, it is of special interest to process graph containment queries effectively on large graph databases. Given a graph database G, and a query raph q, the graph containment query is to retrieve all graphs in G which contain q as subgraph(s). Due to the vast number of graphs in G and the nature of complexity for subgraph isomorphism testing, it is desirable to make use of high-quality graph indexing mechanisms to reduce the overall query processing cost. In this paper, we propose a new cost-effective graph indexing method based on frequent tree-features of the graph database. We analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of tree as indexing feature from three critical aspects feature size, feature selection cost, and pruning power. In order to achieve better pruning ability than existing graph-based indexing methods, we select, in addition to frequent tree-features (Tree), a small number of discriminative graphs (&Delta) on demand, without a costly graph mining process beforehand. Our study verifies that (Tree+&Delta) is a better choice than graph for indexing purpose, denoted (Tree+&Delta &geGraph), to address the graph containment query problem. It has two implications () the index construction by (Tree+&Delta) is efficient, and () the graph containment query processing by (Tree+&Delta) is efficient. Our experimental studies demonstrate that (Tree+&Delta) has a compact index structure, achieves an order of magnitude better performance in index construction, and most importantly, outperforms up-to-date graph-based indexing methods gIndex and C-Tree, in graph containment query processing.|Peixiang Zhao,Jeffrey Xu Yu,Philip S.

The ability to evolve effective air traffic flow strategies depends not only on evolving good local strategies, but also on ensuring that those local strategies result in good global solutions. While traditional, direct evolutionary strategies can be highly effective in certain combinatorial domains, they are not well-suited to complex air traffic flow problems because of the large interdependencies among the local subsystems. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary agent-based solution to the air traffic flow problem. In this approach, we evolve agents both to learn the right local flow strategies to alleviate congestion in their immediate surroundings, and to prevent the creation of congestion \"downstream\" from their local areas. The agent-based approach leads to better and more fault-tolerant solutions. To validate this approach, we use FACET, an air traffic simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry. On a scenario composed of three hundred aircraft and two points of congestion, our results show that an agent based evolutionary computation method, where each agent uses the system evaluation function, achieves % improvement over a direct evolutionary algorithm. In addition by creating agent-specific \"difference evaluation functions\" we achieve an additional % improvement over agents using the system evaluation.|Adrian K.

Because complete algorithms to solve DCOPs are unsuitable for some dynamic or anytime domains, researchers have explored incomplete DCOP algorithms that result in locally optimal solutions. One type of categorization of such algorithms, and the solutions they produce, is k- optimality a k-optimal solution is one that cannot be improved by any deviation by k or fewer agents. This paper presents the first known guarantees on solution quality for k-optimal solutions.
