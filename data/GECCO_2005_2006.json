Estimation of density algorithms (EDAs) are evolutionary optimization techniques, which determine the sampling strategy by means of a parametric probabilistic density function estimated from the population. Real-coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA) does not explicitly estimate any probabilistic distribution, however, the probabilistic model of the population is implicitly estimated by crossovers and the sampling strategy is determined by this implicit probabilistic model. Based on this understanding, we propose a novel density estimation algorithm by using crossovers as nonparametric kernels and apply this kernel density estimation to the Gaussian Mixture modeling. We show that the proposed method is superior in the robustness of the computation and in the accuracy of the estimation by the comparison of conventional EM estimation.|Jun Sakuma,Shigenobu Kobayashi","57456|GECCO|2005|A comparison study between genetic algorithms and bayesian optimize algorithms by novel indices|Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are a search and optimization technique based on the mechanism of evolution.

Machine learning is used to learn probabilistic models of the selected population. This model is then used to generate next population via sampling. An important phenomenon in machine learning from data is called overfitting. This occurs when the model is overly adapted to the specifics of the training data so well that even noise is encoded. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether overfitting happens in EDAs, and to discover its consequences. What is found is overfitting does occur in EDAs overfitting correlates to EDAs performance reduction of overfitting using early stopping can improve EDAs performance.|Hao Wu,Jonathan L.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm. The experimental results indicate that MeSwarm outperforms the standard PSO and several evolutionary algorithms in terms of solution quality.|Bo-Fu Liu,Hung-Ming Chen,Jian-Hung Chen,Shiow-Fen Hwang,Shinn-Ying Ho","57674|GECCO|2006|The correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA|It has previously been shown analytically and experimentally that continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on the normal pdf can easily suffer from premature convergence. This paper takes a principled first step towards solving this problem. First, prerequisites for the successful use of search distributions in EDAs are presented. Then, an adaptive variance scaling theme is introduced that aims at reducing the risk of premature convergence. Integrating the scheme into the iterated density--estimation evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) yields the correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA (CT-AVS-IDEA). The CT-AVS-IDEA is compared to the original IDEA and the Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) on a wide range of unimodal test-problems by means of a scalability analysis. It is found that the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality, competitively with the CMA-ES.

Although investigations in delayed-reward (i.e. multi-step) environments have shown promise, XCS still struggles to efficiently find optimal solutions in environments with long action-chains. This paper highlights the strong relation of XCS to reinforcement learning and identifies some of the major differences. This makes it possible to add Eligibility Traces to XCS, a method taken from reinforcement learning to update the prediction of the whole action-chain on each step, which should cause prediction update to be faster and more accurate. However, it is shown that the discrete nature of the condition representation of a classifier and the operation of the genetic algorithm cause traces to propagate back incorrect prediction values and in some cases results in a decrease of system performance. As a result further investigation of the existing approach to generalisation is proposed.|Jan Drugowitsch,Alwyn Barry","57768|GECCO|2006|An anticipatory approach to improve XCSF|XCSF is a novel version of learning classifier systems (LCS) which extends the typical concept of LCS by introducing computable classifier prediction.

Recently, it was shown that decomposable problems may require effective processing of subsets of problem attributes, which cannot be generally assured with standard crossover operators. A number of competent crossover operators capable of effective identification and processing of arbitrary subsets of variables or string positions were proposed for genetic and evolutionary algorithms. This paper effectively introduces two competent crossover operators to XCS by incorporating techniques from competent genetic algorithms (GAs) the extended compact GA (ECGA) and the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA). Instead of applying standard crossover operators, here a probabilistic model of the global population is built and sampled to generate offspring classifiers locally. Various offspring generation methods are introduced and evaluated. Results indicate that the performance of the proposed learning classifier systems XCSECGA and XCSBOA is similar to that of XCS with informed crossover operators that is given all information about problem structure on input and exploits this knowledge using problem-specific crossover operators.|Martin V.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times.

The (+) EA applies global mutations than can reach any point in the search space in one step together with an elitist selection mechanism. Simulated annealing restricts its search to a neighborhood but employs a randomized selection scheme where the probability for accepting a move to a new point in the search space depends on the difference in function values as well as on the current time step. Otherwise, the two algorithms are equal. It is known that the different philosophies of search implemented in the two heuristics can lead to exponential performance gaps between the two algorithms with respect to the expected optimization time. Even for very restricted classes of objective functions where the differences in function values between neighboring points are strictly limited the performance differences can be huge.

Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors.

With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of (n .) to (n .), where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence nonetheless, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building.|Martin Pelikan,Kumara Sastry,David E.

In nature, in addition to having high fitness, organisms have evolvable genomes phenotypic variation resulting from random mutation is structured and robust. Evolvability is important because it allows the population to produce meaningful variation, leading to efficient search. However, because evolvability does not improve immediate fitness, it must be selected for indirectly. One way to establish such a selection pressure is to change the fitness function systematically. Under such conditions, evolvability emerges only if the representation allows manipulating how genotypic variation maps onto phenotypic variation and if such manipulations lead to detectable changes in fitness. This research forms a framework for understanding how fitness function and representation interact to produce evolvability.

A very natural model of the problem to be solved is the Boltzmann distribution of the fitness function, which is an exponential of the fitness normalized to a probability distribution. As the exponentiation factor (inverse temperature) of the Boltzmann distribution is increased, probability is increasingly concentrated on the set of optimal points. We show that for fitness functions of k-bounded epistasis that satisfy an additional property called the running intersection property, an explicit computable exact factorization of the Boltzmann distribution with an arbitrary exponentiation factor can be constructed. This factorization allows the Boltzmann distribution to be efficiently sampled, which leads to an algorithm which finds the optimum with high probability.|Alden H.

The idea behind Hyper-heuristics is to discover some combination of straightforward heuristics to solve a wide range of problems. To be worthwhile, such combination should outperform the single heuristics. In this paper, the Hyper-heuristic is formed using a XCS-type Learning Classifier System which learns a solution procedure when solving individual problems. The XCS evolves a behavior model which determines the possible actions (selection and placement heuristics) for given states of the problem. When tested with a collection of different problems, the method finds very competitive results for most of the cases. The testebed is composed of problems used in other similar studies in the literature. Some additional instances of the testbed were randomly generated.|Hugo Terashima-Mar√≠n,E. J.

When such a solution is encoded over multiple genes, a genetic algorithm faces the difficult credit assignment problem of evaluating how a single gene in a chromosome contributes to the full solution. Typically a single evaluation function is used for the entire chromosome, implicitly giving each gene in the chromosome the same evaluation. This method is inefficient because a gene will get credit for the contribution of all the other genes as well. Accurately measuring the fitness of individual genes in such a large search space requires many trials. This paper instead proposes turning this single complex search problem into a multi-agent search problem, where each agent has the simpler task of discovering a suitable gene. Gene-specific evaluation functions can then be created that have better theoretical properties than a single evaluation function over all genes. This method is tested in the difficult double-pole balancing problem, showing that agents using gene-specific evaluation functions can create a successful control policy in % fewer trials than the best existing genetic algorithms. The method is extended to more distributed problems, achieving % performance gains over tradition methods in the multi-rover domain.|Adrian K.

Genetic programming has been considered a promising approach for function approximation since it is possible to optimize both the functional form and the coefficients. However, it is not easy to find an optimal set of coefficients by using only non-adjustable constant nodes in genetic programming.

The aim is twofold () to allow infeasible solutions with a promising value of the objective function to remain in the population and also () to increase the probabilities of an individual to generate a better offspring while promoting collaboration of all the population to generate better solutions. These goals are achieved by allowing each parent to generate more than one offspring.

By comparing measured amplitudes of diffracted x-rays through protein crystals with and without the heavy atoms, the locations of the heavy atoms can be estimated. Once the locations of the heavy atoms are known, the phases of the diffracted x-rays through the protein crystal can be estimated, which in turn enables the structure of the protein to be estimated. Unfortunately, the key step in this process is the estimation of the locations of the heavy atoms, and this is a multi-modal, non-linear inverse problem. We report results of a pilot study that show that a -stage hybrid algorithm, using a stochastic genetic algorithm for stage  followed by a deterministic pattern search algorithm for stage , can successfully locate up to  heavy atoms in computer simulated crystals using noise free data. We conclude that the method may be a viable approach for finding heavy atoms in protein crystals, and suggest ways in which the approach can be scaled up to larger problems.|Joshua L.

We show that for fitness functions of k-bounded epistasis that satisfy an additional property called the running intersection property, an explicit computable exact factorization of the Boltzmann distribution with an arbitrary exponentiation factor can be constructed. This factorization allows the Boltzmann distribution to be efficiently sampled, which leads to an algorithm which finds the optimum with high probability.|Alden H.

Their major advantage lies in the fact that they are relatively simple to implement while they allow generalizations for a wide range of real world problems. The multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP), which belongs to the class of NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, is one of the variations of the knapsack problem. The MKP has a wide range of real world applications such as cargo loading, selecting projects to fund, budget management, cutting stock, etc. The MKP has been studied quite extensively in the EA community. Due to the constrained nature of the problem, constraint handling techniques gain great importance in the performance of the proposed EA approaches. In this study, the applicability of a generational EA that uses a penalty-based constraint handling technique and a gene locus based, asymmetric, adaptive mutation scheme is explored for the MKP. The effects of the parameters of the explored approach is determined through tests. Further experiments, using large MKP instances from commonly used benchmarks available through the Internet are performed. Comparison tables are given for the performance of the explored approach and other good performing EAs found in literature for the MKP. Results show that performance improves greatly when compared with other penalty-based techniques, but the explored approach is still not the best performer among all. However, unlike the explored technique, the EAs using the other constraint handling techniques require a great amount of extra computational effort and need heuristic information specific to the optimization problem. Based on these observations, and the fact that the performance difference between the explored scheme and the better performers is not too high, research on improving the explored approach is still in progress.|Sima Uyar,G√ºlsen Eryigit","57539|GECCO|2005|A multi-objective algorithm for DS-CDMA code design based on the clonal selection principle|This paper proposes a new algorithm based on the clonal selection principle for the design of spreading codes for DS-CDMA.

The paper addresses the issue of finding the optimal parameter settings of Pareto Front GP which direct the simulated evolution toward simple models with acceptable prediction error. A generic methodology based on statistical design of experiments is proposed. It includes statistical determination of the number of replicates by half-width confidence intervals, determination of the significant inputs by fractional factorial design of experiments, approaching the optimum by steepest ascentdescent, and local exploration around the optimum by Box Behnken or by central composite design of experiments. The results from implementing the proposed methodology to a small-sized industrial data set show that the statistically significant factors for symbolic regression, based on Pareto Front GP, are the number of cascades, the number of generations, and the population size.

The optimal parameter settings were validated with a separate small sized industrial data set.

As a case study, a methodology for automated synthesis of dynamic systems, based on genetic programming and bond graph modeling (GPBG), is applied to evolve robust low-pass and high-pass analog filters. Compared with a traditional robust design approach based on a state-of-the-art real-parameter genetic algorithm (GA), it is shown that open-ended topology search by genetic programming with a fitness criterion rewarding robustness can evolve more robust systems with respect to parameter perturbations than what was achieved through parameter tuning alone, for our test problems.|Jianjun Hu,Xiwei Zhong,Erik D.

First, it describes the use of genetic programming to automatically synthesize a solution to the challenge problem posed at an international competition held every four years in the field of optical design. In , the competition at the International Optical Design Conference attracted  entries from  well-known optical designers, commercial consultants, and patent holders from many of the field's most prominent companies, universities, and research institutions. The  human contestants spent an average of . hours working on their entries. Virtually all entries were considered good solutions to the challenge problem. Genetic programming automatically synthesized a design \"from scratch\" - that is, without starting from a pre-existing human-created design and without pre-specifying the number of lenses, the physical layout of the lenses, or the numerical or non-numerical parameters of the lenses. The run of genetic programming did not employ any knowledge base of design techniques or principles from the field of optical design and did not entail any human intervention during the run. The genetically evolved optical lens system would have ranked in the middle (st) if it had been entered into the  competition and is therefore an instance of a \"human-competitive\" result produced by genetic programming. Second, this paper presents a mutation operation for numerical constants that is especially appropriate for problems in which the to-be-designed structure contains a large number of non-linearly interrelated numerical values and for problems in which the topology of the solution is to be automatically created.|Lee W.

By comparing measured amplitudes of diffracted x-rays through protein crystals with and without the heavy atoms, the locations of the heavy atoms can be estimated. Once the locations of the heavy atoms are known, the phases of the diffracted x-rays through the protein crystal can be estimated, which in turn enables the structure of the protein to be estimated. Unfortunately, the key step in this process is the estimation of the locations of the heavy atoms, and this is a multi-modal, non-linear inverse problem. We report results of a pilot study that show that a -stage hybrid algorithm, using a stochastic genetic algorithm for stage  followed by a deterministic pattern search algorithm for stage , can successfully locate up to  heavy atoms in computer simulated crystals using noise free data.

Exploration time and efficiency are highly dependent on the size and the ruggedness of the search space.

The approach introduced here aims at improving the exploration process of the SGA by adding a second search process through the way the solutions are coded. An \"observer\" is defined as each possible encoding that aims at reducing the search space. Adequacy of one observer is computed by applying this specific encoding and evaluating how this observer is beneficial for the SGA run. The observers are trained for a specific time by a second evolutionary stage. During the evolution of the observers, the most suitable observer helps the SGA to find a solution to the tackled problem faster.

In periods of quiescence a Genetic Algorithm (GA) should (optimally) exploit good individuals while in periods of change the GA should (optimally) explore new solutions. Self-adaptation is a mechanism which allows individuals in the GA to choose their own mutation rate, and thus allows the GA to control when it explores new solutions or exploits old ones. We examine the use of this mechanism on a recently devised dynamic test suite, the Shaky Ladder Hyperplane-Defined Functions (sl-hdf's). This test suite can generate random problems with similar levels of difficulty and provides a platform allowing systematic controlled observations of the GA in dynamic environments. We show that in a variety of circumstances self-adaptation fails to allow the GA to perform better on this test suite than fixed mutation, even when the environment is static. We also show that mutation is beneficial throughout the run of a GA, and that seeding a population with known good genetic material is not always beneficial to the results. We provide explanations for these observations, with particular emphasis on comparing our results to other results  which have shown the GA to work in static environments.

First we show that there exist a large number of overlapping solutions in each population when EMO algorithms are applied to multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems with only a few objectives. Next we implement three strategies to handle overlapping solutions. One strategy is the removal of overlapping solutions in the objective space. In this strategy, overlapping solutions in the objective space are removed during the generation update phase except for only a single solution among them. As a result, each solution in the current population has a different location in the objective space. Another strategy is to remove overlapping solutions so that each solution in the current population has a different location in the decision space. The other strategy is the modification of Pareto ranking where overlapping solutions in the objective space are allocated to different fronts. As a result, each solution in each front has a different location in the objective space. Effects of each strategy on the performance of the NSGA-II algorithm are examined through computational experiments on multiobjective  knapsack problems, multiobjective flowshop scheduling problems, and multiobjective fuzzy rule selection problems.|Hisao Ishibuchi,Kaname Narukawa,Yusuke Nojima","57514|GECCO|2005|A study of evolutionary robustness in stochastically tiled polyominos|Given an evolutionary optimization problem with many possible genotypes for each phenotype this study investigates if the evolved genes for a given phenotype are more robust to point mutation than randomly sampled genes for the same phenotype.

In this process test case generation plays a crucial role, defining appropriate and error-sensitive test data. The evolutionary white-box testing is a promising approach for the complete automation of structure-oriented test case generation. Here, test case generation can be completely automated with the help of evolutionary algorithms. However, problem cases exist in which the evolutionary test is not able to find valid test data. Thus, in the case of not achieving a test goal, it is not known whether this is due to non-executable program code or a problem case. This paper will investigate how successfully a software measure can support an evolutionary white-box test if the measure can predict the test effort. Hence, the termination criteria of evolutionary white-box testing can be adapted to test goals with problem cases in such a way that problematic test goals are either excluded from the test in advance or can be covered due to an adequate termination criteria according to a software measure.

Compared to numeric test data, test programs optimized for object-oriented unit testing are more complex. Method call sequences that realize interesting test scenarios must be evolved.

In contrast to other approaches in this area, neither repair of individuals nor penalty mechanisms are required. Strongly-typed genetic programming is employed to generate method call trees.

The aim is twofold () to allow infeasible solutions with a promising value of the objective function to remain in the population and also () to increase the probabilities of an individual to generate a better offspring while promoting collaboration of all the population to generate better solutions. These goals are achieved by allowing each parent to generate more than one offspring. The best offspring is selected using a comparison mechanism based on feasibility and this child is compared against its parent. To maintain diversity, the proposed approach uses a mechanism successfully adopted with other evolutionary algorithms where, based on a parameter Sr a solution (between the best offspring and the current parent) with a better value of the objective function can remain in the population, regardless of its feasibility. The proposed approach is validated using test functions from a well-known benchmark commonly adopted to validate constraint-handling techniques used with evolutionary algorithms. The statistical results obtained by the proposed approach are highly competitive (based on quality, robustness and number of evaluations of the objective function) with respect to other constraint-handling techniques, either based on differential evolution or on other evolutionary algorithms, that are representative of the state-of-the-art in the area.

The proposed approach may be used as a part in other immune algorithms, or can possibly be used to detect anomalies in time series data.|Stefan Schadwinkel,Werner Dilger","57760|GECCO|2006|Coevolution of neural networks using a layered pareto archive|The Layered Pareto Coevolution Archive (LAPCA) was recently proposed as an effective Coevolutionary Memory (CM) which, under certain assumptions, approximates monotonic progress in coevolution. In this paper, a technique is developed that interfaces the LAPCA algorithm with NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), a method to evolve neural networks with demonstrated efficiency in game playing domains. In addition, the behavior of LAPCA is analyzed for the first time in a complex game-playing domain evolving neural network controllers for the game Pong. The technique is shown to keep the total number of evaluations in the order of those required by NEAT, making it applicable to complex domains. Pong players evolved with a LAPCA and with the Hall of Fame (HOF) perform equally well, but the LAPCA is shown to require significantly less space than the HOF. Therefore, combining NEAT and LAPCA is found to be an effective approach to coevolution.|German A. Monroy,Kenneth O.

To improve the report sensitivity of the hierarchical wireless sensor networks, an efficient scheduling algorithm is desired. In this paper, we propose a compact genetic algorithm (CGA) to optimize the solution quality for sensor network maintenance. The experimental result shows that the proposed CGA brings better solutions in acceptable calculation time.|Ming-Hui Jin,Cheng-Yan Kao,Yu-Cheng Huang,D.

For example, during the time a signal travels from a peripheral sensor to the central nervous system, a moving object in the environment can cover a significant distance which can lead to critical errors in the effect of the corresponding motor output. This paper proposes that facilitating synapses which show a dynamic sensitivity to the changing input may play an important role in compensating for neural delays, through extrapolation. The idea was tested in a modified D pole-balancing problem which included sensory delays. Within this domain, we tested the behavior of recurrent neural networks with facilitatory neural dynamics trained via neuroevolution. Analysis of the performance and the evolved network parameters showed that, under various forms of delay, networks utilizing extrapolatory dynamics are at a significant competitive advantage compared to networks without such dynamics. In sum, facilitatory (or extrapolatory) dynamics can be used to compensate for delay at a single-neuron level, thus allowing a developing nervous system to stay in touch with the present environmental state.|Heejin Lim,Yoonsuck Choe"]]}}
