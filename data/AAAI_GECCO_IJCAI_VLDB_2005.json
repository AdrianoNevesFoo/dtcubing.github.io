Estimation of density algorithms (EDAs) are evolutionary optimization techniques, which determine the sampling strategy by means of a parametric probabilistic density function estimated from the population. Real-coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA) does not explicitly estimate any probabilistic distribution, however, the probabilistic model of the population is implicitly estimated by crossovers and the sampling strategy is determined by this implicit probabilistic model. Based on this understanding, we propose a novel density estimation algorithm by using crossovers as nonparametric kernels and apply this kernel density estimation to the Gaussian Mixture modeling. We show that the proposed method is superior in the robustness of the computation and in the accuracy of the estimation by the comparison of conventional EM estimation.|Jun Sakuma,Shigenobu Kobayashi","57305|GECCO|2005|Extracted global structure makes local building block processing effective in XCS|Michigan-style learning classifier systems (LCSs), such as the accuracy-based XCS system, evolve distributed problem solutions represented by a population of rules. Recently, it was shown that decomposable problems may require effective processing of subsets of problem attributes, which cannot be generally assured with standard crossover operators. A number of competent crossover operators capable of effective identification and processing of arbitrary subsets of variables or string positions were proposed for genetic and evolutionary algorithms. This paper effectively introduces two competent crossover operators to XCS by incorporating techniques from competent genetic algorithms (GAs) the extended compact GA (ECGA) and the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA). Instead of applying standard crossover operators, here a probabilistic model of the global population is built and sampled to generate offspring classifiers locally. Various offspring generation methods are introduced and evaluated. Results indicate that the performance of the proposed learning classifier systems XCSECGA and XCSBOA is similar to that of XCS with informed crossover operators that is given all information about problem structure on input and exploits this knowledge using problem-specific crossover operators.|Martin V.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm. The experimental results indicate that MeSwarm outperforms the standard PSO and several evolutionary algorithms in terms of solution quality.|Bo-Fu Liu,Hung-Ming Chen,Jian-Hung Chen,Shiow-Fen Hwang,Shinn-Ying Ho","57461|GECCO|2005|Minimum spanning trees made easier via multi-objective optimization|Many real-world problems are multi-objective optimization problems and evolutionary algorithms are quite successful on such problems.

One should not forget that the fitness vector with respect to more than one objective contains more information that in principle can direct the search of evolutionary algorithms. Therefore, it is possible that a single-objective problem can be solved more efficiently via a generalized multi-objective model of the problem.

After selection of some good genes based on signal-to-noise ratio, unsupervised learning like clustering and supervised learning like k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier are widely used in cancer researches to correlate the pathological behavior of cancers with the gene expression levels' differences in cancerous and normal tissues.

We aim at a summarization system that can replicate the quality of summaries created by humans. In this paper we investigate the machine learning method for extracting full sentences from documents based on the document semantic graph structure. In particular, we explore how the Support Vector Machines (SVM) learning method is affected by the quality of linguistic analyses and the corresponding semantic graph representations. We apply two types of linguistic analysis () a simple part-of-speech tagging of noun phrases and verbs and () full logical form analysis which identifies Subject-Predicate-Object triples, and then build the semantic graphs. We train the SVM classifier to identify summary nodes and use these nodes to extract sentences. Experiments with the DUC  and CAST datasets show that the SVM based extraction of sentences does not differ significantly for the simple and the sophisticated syntactic analysis. In both cases the graph attributes used in learning are essential for the classifier performance and the quality of extracted summaries.|Jure Leskovec,Natasa Milic-Frayling,Marko Grobelnik","65605|AAAI|2005|Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Multi-Class Support Vector Machines|We present new unsupervised and semi-supervised training algorithms for multi-class support vector machines based on semidefinite programming.

We propose a method for searching over a space of kernels for composite kernels that are guaranteed to be positive definte, and that are tuned to produce a feature space appropriate for a given dataset. Composite kernel functions are easily interpreted by humans, in contrast to the output of other work on kernel tuning.

QBF provides a natural framework for capturing problem solving and planning in multi-agent settings. However, contrarily to single-agent planning, which can be effectively formulated as SAT, we show that a QBF approach to planning in a multi-agent setting leads to significant unexpected computational difficulties. We identify as a key difficulty of the QBF approach the fact that QBF solvers often end up exploring a much larger search space than the natural search space of the original problem. This is in contrast to the experience with SAT approaches. We also show how one can alleviate these problems by introducing two special QBF formulations and a new QBF solution strategy.

Estimation of density algorithms (EDAs) are evolutionary optimization techniques, which determine the sampling strategy by means of a parametric probabilistic density function estimated from the population. Real-coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA) does not explicitly estimate any probabilistic distribution, however, the probabilistic model of the population is implicitly estimated by crossovers and the sampling strategy is determined by this implicit probabilistic model. Based on this understanding, we propose a novel density estimation algorithm by using crossovers as nonparametric kernels and apply this kernel density estimation to the Gaussian Mixture modeling. We show that the proposed method is superior in the robustness of the computation and in the accuracy of the estimation by the comparison of conventional EM estimation.|Jun Sakuma,Shigenobu Kobayashi","57339|GECCO|2005|Not all linear functions are equally difficult for the compact genetic algorithm|Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) try to solve an optimization problem by finding a probability distribution focussed around its optima.

For an important class of fitness functions, namely those with k-bounded epistasis, it is possible to construct a complete explicit representation of the fitness function by sampling the fitness function. A very natural model of the problem to be solved is the Boltzmann distribution of the fitness function, which is an exponential of the fitness normalized to a probability distribution. As the exponentiation factor (inverse temperature) of the Boltzmann distribution is increased, probability is increasingly concentrated on the set of optimal points. We show that for fitness functions of k-bounded epistasis that satisfy an additional property called the running intersection property, an explicit computable exact factorization of the Boltzmann distribution with an arbitrary exponentiation factor can be constructed. This factorization allows the Boltzmann distribution to be efficiently sampled, which leads to an algorithm which finds the optimum with high probability.|Alden H.

While the traditional feature selection is based on the attribute relevance, our approach is based on a new concept, called feature influence, which is aware of the dynamics and locality of the concept. The feature influence provides a measure of the attribute relevance at a certain instant of the evolutionary learning process, since it depends on each generation. Experimental results have been obtained by comparing an EA--based supervised learning algorithm to its modified version to include the concept approached. The results show an excellent performance, as the new adapted algorithm achieves the same classification results while using less rules, less conditions in rules and much less generations.

Traditionally, each component value is assigned using the information retrieval TFIDF measure. While this weighting method seems very appropriate for IR, it is not clear that it is the best choice for TC problems. Actually, this weighting method does not leverage the information implicitly contained in the categorization task to represent documents. In this paper, we introduce a new weighting method based on statistical estimation of the importance of a word for a specific categorization problem. This method also has the benefit to make feature selection implicit, since useless features for the categorization problem considered get a very small weight. Extensive experiments reported in the paper shows that this new weighting method improves significantly the classification accuracy as measured on many categorization tasks.|Pascal Soucy,Guy W.

Initial experiments in an autonomous car racing simulation demonstrate that FS-NEAT can learn better and faster than regular NEAT. In addition, the networks it evolves are smaller and require fewer inputs.

Besides supporting basic folder operations, Hubble also provides advanced features such as multi-path navigation and folder traversal across multiple document collections. Our performance study shows that Hubble is both efficient and scalable.

The restriction of communication to neighboring hosts makes determining the global state especially difficult, if not impractical. This paper addresses the problem of coordinating the positions of an arbitrary number of services, encapsulated by mobile agents, in a dynamic peer-to-peer network. The agents' collective goal is to minimize the distance between hosts and services, even if the topology is changing constantly. We propose a distributed algorithm to efficiently calculate the stationary distribution of the network. This can be used as a hill climbing heuristic for agents to find near-optimal locations at which to provide services. Finally, we show that the agent-based hill climbing approach is temporally-stable relative to the instantaneous optimum.|Evan Sultanik,William C.

Many techniques have been devised for this problem. and coordinated teamwork has been demonstrated even in highly dynamic and adversarial environments. A key assumption of these techniques. though. is that the team members are developed together as a whole. In many multi agent scenarios. this assumption is violated. We study the problem of coordination in impromptu teams, where a team is composed of independent agents each unknown to the others. The team members have their own skills. models. strategies. and coordination mechanisms. and no external organization is imposed upon them. In particular. we propose two techniques. one adaptive and one predictive. for coordinating a single agent that joins an unknown team of existing agents. We experimentally evaluate these mechanisms in the robot soccer domain, while introducing useful baselines for evaluating the performance of impromptu teams. We show some encouraging success while demonstrating this is a very fertile area of research.|Michael H.

Examples of functionality that has been added are top N , ranking , , spreadsheet computations , grouping sets , data cube , and moving sums  in order to name just a few. Unfortunately, many modern OLAP systems do not use that functionality or replicate a great deal of it in addition to other database-related functionality. In fact, the gap between the functionality provided by an OLAP system and the functionality used from the underlying database systems has widened in the past, rather than narrowed. The reasons for this trend are that SQL as a data definition and query language, the relational model, and the clientserver architecture of the current generation of database products have fundamental shortcomings for OLAP. This paper lists these deficiencies and presents the BTell OLAP engine as an example on how to bridge these shortcomings.

By formulating the correspondence problem in terms of a simple generative model, we are able to efficiently compute matches that incorporate scale, translation, rotation and reflection invariance. A hierarchical scheme with likelihood cut-off provides additional speed-up. In contrast to many shape descriptors, the concept of a mean (prototype) shape follows naturally in this setting.

We use the notion of complete multi-class symmetry and demonstrate the efficacy of our technique through a solver SymChaff that achieves exponential speedup by using simple tags in the specification of problems from both theory and practice. Efficient implementations of DPLL-based SAT solvers are routinely used in areas as diverse as planning, scheduling, design automation, model checking, verification, testing, and algebra. A natural feature of many application domains is the presence of symmetry, such as that amongst all trucks at a certain location in logistics planning and all wires connecting two switch boxes in an FPGA circuit. Many of these problems turn out to have a concise description in many-sorted first order logic. This description can be easily specified by the problem designer and almost as easily inferred automatically. SymChaff, an extension of the popular SAT solver zChaff, uses information obtained from the \"sorts\" in the first order logic constraints to create symmetry sets that are used to partition variables into classes and to maintain and utilize symmetry information dynamically. Current approaches designed to handle symmetry include (A) symmetry breaking predicates (SBPs), (B) pseudo-Boolean solvers with implicit representation for counting, (C) modifications of DPLL that handle symmetry dynamically, and (D) techniques based on ZBDDs. SBPs are prohibitively many, often large, and expensive to compute for problems such as the ones we report experimental results for. Pseudo-Boolean solvers are provably exponentially slow in certain symmetric situations and their implicit counting representation is not always appropriate. Suggested modifications of DPLL either work on limited global symmetry and are difficult to extend, or involve expensive algebraic group computations. Finally, techniques based on ZBDDs often do not compare well even with ordinary DPLL-based solvers. Sym-Chaff addresses and overcomes most of these limitations.|Ashish Sabharwal","16245|IJCAI|2005|Sophia A novel approach for Textual Case-based Reasoning|In this paper we present a novel methodology for textual case-based reasoning.

Experimental results have shown this approach can achieve significant improvements in performance compared with the traditional SAT and CSP approaches.

As a new challenge, the community is now moving to investigate whether similar advances can be made in the use of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). QBF provides a natural framework for capturing problem solving and planning in multi-agent settings. However, contrarily to single-agent planning, which can be effectively formulated as SAT, we show that a QBF approach to planning in a multi-agent setting leads to significant unexpected computational difficulties. We identify as a key difficulty of the QBF approach the fact that QBF solvers often end up exploring a much larger search space than the natural search space of the original problem. This is in contrast to the experience with SAT approaches. We also show how one can alleviate these problems by introducing two special QBF formulations and a new QBF solution strategy.

However, in many application domains the classical super solutions framework is not expressive enough since it only reasons about the number of breaks in a solution and the number of changes that are necessary to find a repair. For example, in combinatorial auctions we may wish to guarantee that we can always find a repair solution whose revenue exceeds some threshold while limiting the cost associated with forming such a repair. In this paper we present the weighted super solution framework that involves two important extensions. Firstly, the set of variables that may lose their values is determined using a probabilistic approach enabling us to find repair solutions for assignments that are most likely to fail. Secondly, we include a mechanism for reasoning about the cost of repair. The proposed framework has been successfully used to find robust solutions to combinatorial auctions.|Alan Holland,Barry O'Sullivan","65576|AAAI|2005|Discriminative Training of Markov Logic Networks|Many machine learning applications require a combination of probability and first-order logic. Markov logic networks (MLNs) accomplish this by attaching weights to first-order clauses, and viewing these as templates for features of Markov networks. Model parameters (i.e., clause weights) can be learned by maximizing the likelihood of a relational database, but this can be quite costly and lead to suboptimal results for any given prediction task. In this paper we propose a discriminative approach to training MLNs, one which optimizes the conditional likelihood of the query predicates given the evidence ones, rather than the joint likelihood of all predicates. We extend Collins's () voted perceptron algorithm for HMMs to MLNs by replacing the Viterbi algorithm with a weighted satisfiability solver. Experiments on entity resolution and link prediction tasks show the advantages of this approach compared to generative MLN training, as well as compared to purely probabilistic and purely logical approaches.|Parag Singla,Pedro Domingos","16153|IJCAI|2005|Optimal Refutations for Constraint Satisfaction Problems|Variable ordering heuristics have long been an important component of constraint satisfaction search algorithms.

They interleave a local lookahead search with movement execution, explore an initially unknown map, and converge to better paths over repeated experiences. In this paper, we first investigate how three known extensions of the most popular learning real-time search algorithm (LRTA*) influence its performance in a path-finding domain. Then, we combine automatic state abstraction with learning real-time search. Our scheme of dynamically building a state abstraction allows us to generalize updates to the heuristic function, thereby speeding up learning.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs. Our empirical results show that our modified IP on mPSRs outperforms, in most cases, IP on both PSRs and POMDPs.|Michael R. James,Satinder P.

Predictive state representations (PSRs) are a type of model that uses predictions about future observations to capture the state of a dynamical system. However, PSRs do not use memory of past observations. We propose a model called memory-PSRs that uses both memories of the past, and predictions of the future. We show that the use of memories provides a number of potential advantages. It can reduce the size of the model (in comparison to a PSR model). In addition many dynamical systems have memories that can serve as landmarks that completely determine the current state. The detection and recognition of landmarks is advantageous because they can serve to reset a model that has gotten off-track, as often happens when the model is learned from samples. This paper develops both memory-PSRs and the use and detection of landmarks.|Michael R. James,Britton Wolfe,Satinder P.

However, the existence of state behavior in test objects presents additional challenges for Evolutionary Testing, not least because certain test goals may require a search for a sequence of inputs to the test object. Furthermore, state-based test objects often make use of internal variables such as boolean flags, enumerations and counters for managing or querying their internal state. These types of variables can lead to a loss of information in computing fitness values, producing coarse or flat fitness landscapes. This results in the search receiving less guidance, and the chances of finding required test data are decreased.This paper proposes an extended approach based on previous works. Input sequences are generated, and internal variable problems are addressed through hybridization with an extended Chaining Approach. The basic idea of the Chaining Approach is to find a sequence of statements, involving internal variables, which need to be executed prior to the test goal. By requiring these statements are executed, information previously unavailable to the search can be made use of, possibly guiding it into potentially promising and unexplored areas of the test object's input domain. A number of experiments demonstrate the value of the approach.|Phil McMinn,Mike Holcombe","65494|AAAI|2005|Diagnosis as Approximate Belief State Enumeration for Probabilistic Concurrent Constraint Automata|As autonomous spacecraft and other robotic systems grow increasingly complex, there is a pressing need for capabilities that more accurately monitor and diagnose system state while maintaining reactivity. Mode estimation addresses this problem by reasoning over declarative models of the physical plant, represented as a factored variant of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), called Probabilistic Concurrent Constraint Automata (PCCA). Previous mode estimation approaches track a set of most likely PCCA state trajectories, enumerating them in order of trajectory probability. Although Best-First Trajectory Enumeration (BFTE) is efficient, ignoring the additional trajectories that lead to the same state can significantly underestimate the true state probability and result in misdiagnosis. This paper introduces an innovative belief approximation technique, called Best-First Belief State Enumeration (BFBSE), that addresses this limitation by computing estimate probabilities directly from the HMM belief state update equations. Theoretical and empirical results show that BFBSE significantly increases estimator accuracy, uses less memory, and requires less computation time when enumerating a moderate number of estimates for the approximate belief state of subsystem sized models.|Oliver B.

GAs also optimize additive feature offsets in search of an optimal point of reference for assessing angular similarity using the cosine measure. This poster explores weight and offset optimization for knn with varying similarity measures, including Euclidian distance (weights only), cosine similarity, and Pearson correlation. The use of offset optimization here represents a novel technique for enhancing Pearsonknn classification performance. Experiments compare optimized and non-optimized classifiers using public domain datasets. While unoptimized Euclidian knn often outperforms its cosine and Pearson counterparts, optimized Pearson and cosine knn classifiers show equal or improved accuracy compared to weight-optimized Euclidian knn.|Michael R.

Existing research on scene understanding is typically focused on classifying a scene into classes that are of the same category type. These approaches, although they solve some scene-understanding tasks successfully, in general fail to address the semantics in scene understanding. For example, how does an agent learn the concept label \"red\" and \"ball\" without being told that it is a color or a shape label in advance To cope with this problem, we have proposed a novel research called semantic scene concept learning. Our proposed approach models the task of scene understanding as a \"multi-labeling\" classification problem. Each scene instance perceived by the agent may receive multiple labels coming from different concept categories, where the goal of learning is to let the agent discover the semantic meanings, i.e., the set of relevant visual features, of the scene labels received. Our preliminary experiments have shown the effectiveness of our proposed approach in solving this special intra- and inter-category mixing learning task.|Weiyu Zhu","16136|IJCAI|2005|Learning Strategies for Open-Domain Natural Language Question Answering|We present an approach to automatically learning strategies for natural language question answering from examples composed of textual sources, questions, and answers.

For an important class of fitness functions, namely those with k-bounded epistasis, it is possible to construct a complete explicit representation of the fitness function by sampling the fitness function. A very natural model of the problem to be solved is the Boltzmann distribution of the fitness function, which is an exponential of the fitness normalized to a probability distribution. As the exponentiation factor (inverse temperature) of the Boltzmann distribution is increased, probability is increasingly concentrated on the set of optimal points. We show that for fitness functions of k-bounded epistasis that satisfy an additional property called the running intersection property, an explicit computable exact factorization of the Boltzmann distribution with an arbitrary exponentiation factor can be constructed. This factorization allows the Boltzmann distribution to be efficiently sampled, which leads to an algorithm which finds the optimum with high probability.|Alden H.
