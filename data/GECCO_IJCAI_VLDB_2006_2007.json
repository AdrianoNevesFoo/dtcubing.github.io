As an important branch of learning classifier systems, XCS has been proven capable of evolving maximally accurate, maximally general problem solutions. However, in practice, it oftentimes generates a lot of rules, which lower the readability of the evolved classification model, and thus, people may not be able to get the desired knowledge or useful information out of the model. Inspired by the fault tolerance mechanism proposed in field of data mining, we devise a new XCS framework by integrating the concept and mechanism of fault tolerance into XCS in order to reduce the number of classification rules and therefore to improve the readability of the generated prediction model. A series of $N$-multiplexer experiments, including -bit, -bit, -bit, and -bit multiplexers, are conducted to examine whether XCSFT can accomplish its goal of design. According to the experimental results, XCSFT can offer the same level of prediction accuracy on the test problems as XCS can, while the prediction model evolved by XCSFT consists of significantly fewer classification rules.|Hong-Wei Chen,Ying-Ping Chen","57733|GECCO|2006|Fast rule matching for learning classifier systems via vector instructions|Over the last ten years XCS has become the standard for Michigan-style learning classifier systems (LCS). Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time. The proposed fast matching scheme also fits in any other LCS other than XCS.|Xavier Llorà,Kumara Sastry","58006|GECCO|2007|Support vector regression for classifier prediction|In this paper we introduce XCSF with support vector predictionthe problem of learning the prediction function is solved as a support vector regression problem and each classifier exploits a Support Vector Machine to compute the prediction.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

In this paper, we propose a generalized additive Bayesian network classifiers, which transfers the structure learning problem to a generalized additive models (GAM) learning problem. We first generate a series of very simple BNs, and put them in the framework of GAM, then adopt a gradient-based algorithm to learn the combining parameters, and thus construct a more powerful classifier.

Furthermore, G-PSO adopts a \"reactive\" determination of the step size, based on feedback from the last iterations. This is in contrast to the basic particle swarm algorithm, in which the particles explore the search space by using both the individual \"cognitive\" component and the \"social\" knowledge and no feedback is used for the self-tuning of algorithm parameters.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa","57685|GECCO|2006|A new proposal for multi-objective optimization using differential evolution and rough sets theory|This paper presents a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on differential evolution and rough sets theory. The proposed approach adopts an external archive in order to retain the nondominated solutions found during the evolutionary process. Additionally, the approach also incorporates the concept of pa-dominance to get a good distribution of the solutions retained. The main idea of the approach is to use differential evolution (DE) as our main search engine, trying to translate its good convergence properties exhibited in single-objective optimization to the multi-objective case. Rough sets theory is adopted in a second stage of the search in order to improve the spread of the nondominated solutions that have been found so far. Our hybrid approach is validated using standard test functions and metrics commonly adopted in the specialized literature.

Amongst optimisation algorithms driven by evolutionary computation techniques,particle swarm algorithms have proven to be a very good alternative to genetic algorithms because of their faster convergence. However they can still suffer from premature convergence to local optima. Premature convergence occurs when the particles of the swarm are too close to each other to enable further exploration of the space. To put it another way, the dispersion or distribution of the swarm throughout the search space has been localised to a small region with a consequent stagnation of the search process. Many strategies have been used to try to prevent convergence to a local optimum. However little work has been done on problems of high dimensions. By high dimensions, we mean dimensions of  and above.This paper focuses, therefore, on the limitations of classical particle swarm algorithms when dealing with high dimensional problems. We compare different versions of Particle Swarm Algorithms GBest, LBest with ringor random neighbourhood of size citeClerc, and GCPSOciteVanDenBergh. Those algorithmswere run twice, with a linearly decreasing inertia weight, and with the use of a constriction factor.We also used two repulsive-based algorithms Charged PSOciteBlackwell and Predator PreyciteSilva.Our main focus is problems of high dimensionality. In particular, we applied the different algorithmsto the benchmarks functions Ackley and Rosenbrock, in the following dimensions , , .Even though these represent problems of relatively small dimensionality in a real-world context,experiments on higher dimensions have not been necessary to show the limits of the algorithms studied.Each experiment was run  times. The swarm size was chosen from $    $ and so that it isnot greater than the problem size. Each experiment is  iterations long.A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the performance of each algorithms. We found that the LBest algorithms perform significantly better when used with the constriction factor.GBest and GCPSO perform better with linearly decreasing inertia with a small swarm size, but better with the constriction factorwith a big swarm size. The improvement of GCPSO on GBest is not statistically significant in our experiments. The LBest algorithms with the constriction factor seem to be the best algorithms to handle problems of high dimensionality. The LBest algorithm with fixed neighbourhood seems to be less sensitive to the size of the swarm than the LBest algorithm with randomneighbourhood. Especially, in the case of the Rosenbrock function of size , increasing the sizeof the swarm does not improve the performance of LBest with constricted factor and fixed neighbourhood.The algorithms based on repulsion between particles, i.e. Charged Swarm and Predator Prey, do not perform very well.Indeed, even if the predator prey algorithm gives quite good results, it is trapped in a local optimum, as the fitness value stagnates on a constant value for the last % of iterations. This may come from a too low levelof repulsion. Tuning the parameters used for repulsion seems to be very important for high dimensionality problems. Experiments show that almost all the algorithms managed to solve the problems for dimension  butnone of the algorithms managed to solve the problem in the case of problems of dimension  and . The LBest algorithm with random neighbourhood and constriction factor performed the best. Further work will be done on modelling the size of the swarm required to be able to solve the problems. Other particle swarm algorithms will also be included.|Sébastien Piccand,Michael O'Neill,Jacqueline Walker"],["57958|GECCO|2007|Dendritic cells for SYN scan detection|Artificial immune systems have previously been applied to the problem of intrusion detection.

However, traditional information retrieval techniques are likely to be expensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized. Our performance evaluation using the INEX data set in the Quark  open-source XML database system indicates that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient.|Feng Shao,Lin Guo,Chavdar Botev,Anand Bhaskar,Muthiah Chettiar,Fan Yang 0002,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram","80703|VLDB|2006|Mapping Moving Landscapes by Mining Mountains of Logs Novel Techniques for Dependency Model Generation|Problem diagnosis for distributed systems is usually difficult. Thus, an automated support is needed to identify root causes of encountered problems such as performance lags or inadequate functioning quickly. The many tools and techniques existing today that perform this task rely usually on some dependency model of the system. However, in complex and fast evolving environments it is practically unfeasible to keep such a model up-to-date manually and it has to be created in an automatic manner. For high level objects this is in itself a challenging and less studied task. In this paper, we propose three different approaches to discover dependencies by mining system logs. Our work is inspired by a recently developed data mining algorithm and techniques for collocation extraction from the natural language processing field. We evaluate the techniques in a case study for Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and perform large-scale experiments on production data.

F-logic has generated considerable interest commercially, in the academia, and within various standardization efforts as a means for building ontologies and for reasoning on the Semantic Web. Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature.

In sharp contrast to standard information integration architectures, a dataspace management system is a data-coexistence approach it does not require any investments in semantic integration before querying services on the data are provided. Rather, a dataspace can be gradually enhanced over time by defining relationships among the data. Defining those integration semantics gradually is termed pay-as-you-go information integration , as time and effort (pay) are needed over time (go) to provide integration semantics. The benefits are better query results (gain). This paper is the first to explore pay-as-you-go information integration in dataspaces. We provide a technique for declarative pay-as-you-go information integration named iTrails. The core idea of our approach is to declaratively add lightweight 'hints' (trails) to a search engine thus allowing gradual enrichment of loosely integrated data sources. Our experiments confirm that iTrails can be efficiently implemented introducing only little overhead during query execution. At the same time iTrails strongly improves the quality of query results. Furthermore, we present rewriting and pruning techniques that allow us to scale iTrails to tens of thousands of trail definitions with minimal growth in the rewritten query size.|Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles,Jens-Peter Dittrich,Shant Kirakos Karakashian,Olivier René Girard,Lukas Blunschi","80654|VLDB|2006|InteMon Intelligent System Monitoring on Large Clusters|InteMon is a prototype monitoring and mining system for large clusters.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs.

Evolutionary computation is one of the most promising approaches to reinforcement learning but its success is largely restricted to off-line scenarios. In on-line scenarios, an agent must strive to maximize the reward it accrues while it is learning. Temporal difference (TD) methods, another approach to reinforcement learning, naturally excel in on-line scenarios because they have selection mechanisms for balancing the need to search for better policies exploration) with the need to accrue maximal reward (exploitation). This paper presents a novel way to strike this balance in evolutionary methods by borrowing the selection mechanisms used by TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolution to choose policies for evaluation. Empirical results in the mountain car and server job scheduling domains demonstrate that these techniques can substantially improve evolution's on-line performance in stochastic domains.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone","57748|GECCO|2006|A representational ecology for learning classifier systems|The representation used by a learning algorithm introduces a bias which is more or less well-suited to any given learning problem. It is well known that, across all possible problems, one algorithm is no better than any other. Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies.

While any search space can be observed at any scale according to the level of details, there is nothing inherent to the classical metaheuristics to naturally account for this multi-scaling. Nevertheless, the wider the search space the longer the time needed by any metaheuristic to discover and exploit the \"promising\" zones. Any possibility to compress this time is welcome. Abstracting the search space during the search is one such possibility. For instance, a common Ordering Genetic Algorithm (o-GA) is not well suited to efficiently resolve very large instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The mechanism presented here (reminiscent of Gestalt psychology) aims at abstracting the search space by substituting the variables of the problems with macro-versions of them. This substitution allows any given metaheuristic to tackle the problem at various scales or through different multi-resolution lenses. In the TSP problem to be treated here, the towns will simply be aggregated into regions and the metaheuristics will apply on this new one-level-up search space. The whole problem becomes now how to discover the most appropriate regions and to merge this discovery with the running of the o-GA at the new level.|Christophe Philemotte,Hugues Bersini","16690|IJCAI|2007|Fast Planning with Iterative Macros|Research on macro-operators has a long history in planning and other search applications.

Iterative macros exhibit both the potential advantages (e.g., travel fast towards goal) and the potential limitations (e.g., utility problem) of classical macros, only on a much larger scale. A family of techniques are introduced to balance this trade-off in favor of faster planning.

The main tool is abstraction we identify a new, weaker, condition under which abstraction is \"safe\", in the sense that any solution to the abstracted problem can be refined to a concrete solution (in polynomial time, for most cases) and also show how different kinds of problem reformulations can be applied to create greater opportunities for such safe abstraction.|Patrik Haslum","16621|IJCAI|2007|Solving POMDPs Using Quadratically Constrained Linear Programs|Developing scalable algorithms for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is an important challenge.

I demonstrate how a simple feature class, variable-position motifs within fixed-length strings, may be exploited by a powerful EDA, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA). Experimental results are presented where motifs are learned autonomously via a simple heuristic. The effectiveness of this feature-based BOA is demonstrated across a range of problems where such motifs are relevant.|Moshe Looks","57789|GECCO|2006|Optimising cancer chemotherapy using an estimation of distribution algorithm and genetic algorithms|This paper presents a methodology for using heuristic search methods to optimise cancer chemotherapy.

The DDE algorithm is simple in nature such that it first mutates a target population to produce the mutant population. Then the target population is recombined with the mutant population in order to generate a trial population. Finally, a selection operator is applied to both target and trial populations to determine who will survive for the next generation based on fitness evaluations. As a mutation operator in the discrete differential evolution algorithm, a destruction and construction procedure is employed to generate the mutant population. We propose a referenced local search, which is embedded in the discrete differential evolution algorithm to further improve the solution quality. Computational results show that the proposed DDE algorithm with the referenced local search is very competitive to the iterated greedy algorithm which is one of the best performing algorithms for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem in the literature.|Quan-Qe Pan,Mehmet Fatih Tasgetiren,Yun-Chia Liang","80843|VLDB|2007|Over-encryption Management of Access Control Evolution on Outsourced Data|Data outsourcing is emerging today as a successful paradigm allowing users and organizations to exploit external services for the distribution of resources. A crucial problem to be addressed in this context concerns the enforcement of selective authorization policies and the support of policy updates in dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel solution to the enforcement of access control and the management of its evolution. Our proposal is based on the application of selective encryption as a means to enforce authorizations. Two layers of encryption are imposed on data the inner layer is imposed by the owner for providing initial protection, the outer layer is imposed by the server to reflect policy modifications. The combination of the two layers provides an efficient and robust solution. The paper presents a model, an algorithm for the management of the two layers, and an analysis to identify and therefore counteract possible information exposure risks.|Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati,Sara Foresti,Sushil Jajodia,Stefano Paraboschi,Pierangela Samarati","57674|GECCO|2006|The correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA|It has previously been shown analytically and experimentally that continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on the normal pdf can easily suffer from premature convergence. This paper takes a principled first step towards solving this problem. First, prerequisites for the successful use of search distributions in EDAs are presented. Then, an adaptive variance scaling theme is introduced that aims at reducing the risk of premature convergence. Integrating the scheme into the iterated density--estimation evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) yields the correlation-triggered adaptive variance scaling IDEA (CT-AVS-IDEA). The CT-AVS-IDEA is compared to the original IDEA and the Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) on a wide range of unimodal test-problems by means of a scalability analysis. It is found that the average number of fitness evaluations grows subquadratically with the dimensionality, competitively with the CMA-ES.

Properties and processes from natural ecosystems are abstracted and applied to the design of creative systems, in a similar way that evolutionary computing methods use the metaphor of Darwinian evolution to solve problems in search and optimisation. The paper examines some appropriate mechanisms and metaphors when applying artificial ecosystems to problems in creative design. General properties and processes of evolutionary artificial ecosystems are presented as a basis for developing individual systems that automate the discovery of novelty without explicit teleological goals. The adaptation of species to fit their environment drives the creative solutions, so the role of the designer shifts to the design of environments. This allows a variety of creative solutions to emerge in simulation without the need for explicit or human-evaluated fitness measures, such as those used in interactive evolution.

Over these kind of over changing, complex and ubiquitous real-world problems, the explorative-exploitive subtle counterbalance character of our current state-of-the-art search algorithms should be biased towards an increased explorative behavior. While counterproductive in classic problems, the main and obvious reason of using it in severe dynamic problems is simple while we engage ourselves in exploiting the extrema, the extrema moves elsewhere. In order to tackle this subtle compromise, we propose a novel algorithm for optimization in dynamic binary landscapes, stressing the role of negative feedback mechanisms. The Binary Ant Algorithm (BAA) mimics some aspects of social insects' behavior. Like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), BAA acts by building pheromone maps over a graph of possible trails representing pseudo-solutions of increasing quality to a specific optimization problem. Main differences rely on the way this search space is represented and provided to the colony in order to exploreexploit it, while and more important, we enrol in providing strong evaporation to the problem-habitat. By a process of pheromone reinforcement and evaporation the artificial insect's trails over the graph converge to regions near the ideal solution of the optimization problem. Over each generation, positive feedbacks made available by pheromone reinforcement consolidate the best solutions found so far, while enhanced negative feedbacks given by the evaporation mechanism provided the system with population diversity and fast self-adaptive characteristics, allowing BAA to be particularly suitable for severe complex dynamic optimization problems. Experiments made with some well known test functions frequently used in the Evolutionary Algorithms' research field illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. BAA was also compared with other algorithms, proving to be more able to track fast moving extrema on several test problems.|Carlos Fernandes,Agostinho C.

One approach to achieve required sensing coverage is to use robots to convey sensors within this space. Planning the motion of these robots - coordinating their paths in order to maximize the amount of information collected while placing bounds on their resources (e.g., path length or energy capacity) - is aNP-hard problem. In this paper, we present an efficient path planning algorithm that coordinates multiple robots, each having a resource constraint, to maximize the \"informativeness\" of their visited locations. In particular, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to characterize the amount of information collected. We provide strong theoretical approximation guarantees for our algorithm by exploiting the submodularity property of mutual information. In addition, we improve the efficiency of our approach by extending the algorithm using branch and bound and a region-based decomposition of the space.

False positives refer to the false detection of normal behavior as malicious behavior. Artificial Immune Systems (AISs) also fall under the category of anomaly based-NID systems. AIS presented in this paper is as a victim-end filter, consisting of detectors distributed on the network, which distinguishes normal traffic from malicious traffic. In this work, we focus on TCP-SYN flood based Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. AISs normally utilize the negative selection algorithm in thymus action to tolerize the detectors to normal traffic so they may not detect normal traffic as malicious traffic. We propose and implement extended thymus action' model to improve this characteristic of AIS.

At first, we consider for a multidimensional data set P the problem of dynamic skyline queries according to a query point q. This kind of dynamic skyline corresponds to the skyline of a transformed data space where point q becomes the origin and all points of P are represented by their distance vector to q. The reverse skyline query returns the objects whose dynamic skyline contains the query object q. In order to compute the reverse skyline of an arbitrary query point, we first propose a Branch and Bound algorithm (called BBRS), which is an improved customization of the original BBS algorithm. Furthermore, we identify a super set of the reverse skyline that is used to bound the search space while computing the reverse skyline. To further reduce the computational cost of determining if a point belongs to the reverse skyline, we propose an enhanced algorithm (called RSSA) that is based on accurate pre-computed approximations of the skylines. These approximations are used to identify whether a point belongs to the reverse skyline or not. Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets, we show that our algorithms can efficiently support reverse skyline queries. Our enhanced approach improves reversed skyline processing by up to an order of magnitude compared to the algorithm without the usage of pre-computed approximations.|Evangelos Dellis,Bernhard Seeger","80772|VLDB|2007|Unifying Data and Domain Knowledge Using Virtual Views|The database community is on a constant quest for better integration of data management and knowledge management.

Outdated and incomplete statistics have a bigger impact on federated DBMS than on regular DBMS, as maintenance of federated statistics is unequally more complicated and expensive than the maintenance of the local statistics consequently bad performance commonly occurs for federated queries due to the selection of a suboptimal query plan.

POPFED uses (a) an opportunistic, but risk controlled reoptimization technique for federated DBMS, (b) a technique for multiple reoptimizations during federated query processing with a strategy to discover redundant and eliminate partial results, and (c) a mechanism to eagerly procure statistics in a federated environment. In this demonstration we showcase POPFED implemented in a prototype version of WebSphere Information Integrator for DB using the TPC-H benchmark database and its workload. For selected queries of the workload we show unique features including multi-round reoptimizations using both a new graphical reoptimization progress monitor POPMonitor and the DB graphical plan explain tool.|Holger Kache,Wook-Shin Han,Volker Markl,Vijayshankar Raman,Stephan Ewen","80621|VLDB|2006|Containment of Conjunctive Object Meta-Queries|We consider the problem of query containment over an object data model derived from F-logic. F-logic has generated considerable interest commercially, in the academia, and within various standardization efforts as a means for building ontologies and for reasoning on the Semantic Web. Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature. We show that, even for queries over meta-information together with data, this problem is decidable for non-recursive conjunctive queries. We also provide relevant complexity results.|Andrea Calì,Michael Kifer","80701|VLDB|2006|AQAX A System for Approximate XML Query Answers|On-line, interactive exploration of large databases becomes prohibitively expensive as the size of the database grows. Approximate query answering offers a cost-effective solution to this problem, by enabling the fast generation of approximate results based on concise data summaries. We apply this paradigm in the context of XML databases, where the increased complexity of data and queries amplifies the challenges behind interactive exploration. We have developed an on-line XML exploration system, termed AQAX that relies on accurate XML summaries in order to enable the rapid exploration of large data sets. To effectively support the exploration of semi-structured query answers, our system employs a tight coupling between the main query processor and the graphical clients that visualize the results.

However, much less of such type of work has been done for efficient XSLT processing of XML documents stored and managed by the database. This is partially due to the observation that the rule based template driven XSLT execution model does not fit nicely with the traditional declarative query language processing model which leverages index probing and iterator based pull mode that can be scaled to handle large size data. In this paper, we share our experience of efficient processing of XSLT in Oracle XML DB. We present the technique of processing XSLT efficiently in database by rewriting XSLT stylesheets into highly efficient XQuery through partially evaluating XSLT over the XML documents structural information. Consequently, we can leverage all the work done for efficient XQueryXPath processing in database to achieve combined optimisations of XSLT with XQueryXPath and SQLXML in Oracle XMLDB. This effectively makes XSLT processing scale to large size XML documents using classical declarative query processing techniques in DBMS.|Zhen Hua Liu,Anguel Novoselsky","80710|VLDB|2006|Efficient Secure Query Evaluation over Encrypted XML Databases|Motivated by the \"database-as-service\" paradigm wherein data owned by a client is hosted on a third-party server, there is significant interest in secure query evaluation over encrypted databases. We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

In many applications, e.g., XML security enforcement, it is prohibitively expensive to materialize and maintain a large number of views. Therefore, views are necessarily virtual. An immediate question then is how to answer queries on XML virtual views. A common approach is to rewrite a query on the view to an equivalent one on the underlying document, and evaluate the rewritten query. This is the approach used in the Secure MOdular Query Engine (SMOQE). The demo presents SMOQE, the first system to provide efficient support for answering queries over virtual and possibly recursively defined XML views. We demonstrate a set of novel techniques for the specification of views, the rewriting, evaluation and optimization of XML queries.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times.

In such an analysis, critical numerical measures, such as profit and sales, fluctuate over time and form time-series data. Moreover, the time series data correspond to market segments, which are described by a set of attributes, such as age, gender, education, income level, and product-category, that form a multi-dimensional structure. To better understand market dynamics and predict future trends, it is crucial to study the dynamics of time-series in multi-dimensional market segments. This is a topic that has been largely ignored in time series and data cube research. In this study, we examine the issues of anomaly detection in multi-dimensional time-series data.

This facilitates the detection of anomalies based on expected values derived from higher level, \"more general\" time-series. Anomaly detection in a time-series data cube poses computational challenges, especially for high-dimensional, large data sets.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16489|IJCAI|2007|A Theoretical Framework for Learning Bayesian Networks with Parameter Inequality Constraints|The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data.

Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions.

First of all, we review premature convergence, one of the challenges confronted with when applying GAs to real-world problems. Next, some of the methods now available to prevent premature convergence and their intrinsic defects are discussed. A qualitative analysis is then done on the cause of premature convergence that is the loss of building blocks hosted in less-fit individuals during the course of evolution. Thus, we propose a new improver - GAs with Reserve Selection (GARS), where a reserved area is set up to save potential building blocks and a selection mechanism based on individual uniqueness is employed to activate the potentials. Finally, case studies are done in a few standard problems well known in the literature, where the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GARS in suppressing premature convergence, and also an enhancement is found in global optimization capacity.|Yang Chen,Jinglu Hu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Songnian Yu","57687|GECCO|2006|A genetic algorithm for the longest common subsequence problem|A genetic algorithm for the longest common subsequence problem encodes candidate sequences as binary strings that indicate subsequences of the shortest or first string.

Additionally, this approach has the ability to locate a behavior structure which a developer may not have previously considered, and whose ability exceeds expectations. The evolution of the behavior structure is demonstrated using agents in the Robocode environment, with the evolved structures performing up to  percent better than one crafted by an expert.|Brian G.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

Redundantly stored information can lead not just to a higher data storage cost, but also to increased costs for data transfer and data manipulation. Furthermore, such data redundancies can lead to potential update anomalies, rendering the database inconsistent.One way to avoid data redundancies is to employ good schema design based on known functional dependencies. In fact, several recent studies have focused on defining the notion of XML Functional Dependencies (XML FDs) to capture XML data redundancies. We observe further that XML databases are often \"casually designed\" and XML FDs may not be determined in advance. Under such circumstances, discovering XML data redundancies (in terms of FDs) from the data itself becomes necessary and is an integral part of the schema refinement process.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first system, DiscoverXFD, for effcient discovery of XML data redundancies. It employs a novel XML data structure and introduces a new class of partition based algorithms. DiscoverXFD can not only be used for the previous definitions of XML functional dependencies, but also for a more comprehensive notion we develop in this paper, capable of detecting redundancies involving set elements while maintaining clear semantics.

Traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness of answer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes, even if they wind up being relevant to a user query. Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such possible answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being pertinent answers to the query. The autonomous nature of web databases poses several challenges in realizing this objective. Such challenges include the restricted access privileges imposed on the data, the limited support for query patterns, and the bounded pool of database and network resources in the web environment. We introduce a novel query rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges. Our technique involves reformulating the user query based on mined correlations among the database attributes. The reformulated queries are aimed at retrieving the relevant possible answers in addition to the certain answers. QPIAD is able to gauge the relevance of such queries allowing tradeoffs in reducing the costs of database query processing and answer transmission. To support this framework, we develop methods for mining attribute correlations (in terms of Approximate Functional Dependencies), value distributions (in the form of Na&iumlve Bayes Classifiers), and selectivity estimates. We present empirical studies to demonstrate that our approach is able to effectively retrieve relevant possible answers with high precision, high recall, and manageable cost.|Garrett Wolf,Hemal Khatri,Bhaumik Chokshi,Jianchun Fan,Yi Chen,Subbarao Kambhampati","80690|VLDB|2006|An Algebraic Query Model for Effective and Efficient Retrieval of XML Fragments|Finding a suitable fragment of interest in a nonschematic XML document with a simple keyword search is a complex task.

In contrast to earlier work, our model supports filters for restricting the size of a query result, which otherwise may contain a large number of potentially irrelevant fragments. We introduce a class of filters having a special property that enables significant reduction in query processing cost. Many practically useful filters fall in this class and hence, the proposed model can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents.

We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical NBA players\", the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players\", the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed. Computing the exact answer to a top-k typicality query requires quadratic time which is often too costly for online query answering on large databases.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries.

Given a query and a view, the QAV problem is traditionally formulated in two ways (i) find an equivalent rewriting of the query using only the view, or (ii) find a maximal contained rewriting using only the view. The former is appropriate for classical query optimization and was recently studied by Xu and Ozsoyoglu for tree pattern queries (TP). However, for information integration, we cannot rely on equivalent rewriting and must instead use maximal contained rewriting as shown by Halevy. Motivated by this, we study maximal contained rewriting for TP, a core subset of XPath, both in the absence and presence of a schema. In the absence of a schema, we show there are queries whose maximal contained rewriting (MCR) can only be expressed as the union of exponentially many TPs. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting and give a polynomial time algorithm for testing the existence of an MCR. We also give an algorithm for generating the MCR when one exists. We then consider QAV in the presence of a schema. We characterize the existence of a maximal contained rewriting when the schema contains no recursion or union types, and show that it consists of at most one TP. We give an efficient polynomial time algorithm for generating the maximal contained rewriting whenever it exists. Finally, we discuss QAV in the presence of recursive schemas.|Laks V. S.

In many cases, a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results.

In this paper, we first show that answering queries with further structure imposed on them remains NP-hard. We next show that, while the query evaluation task can be viewed in terms of ranked structural-joins along query axes, the monotonicity property, necessary for ranked join algorithms, is violated. Consequently, traditional ranked join algorithms are not directly applicable. Thus, we establish an alternative, sum-max monotonicity property and show how to leverage this for developing a self-punctuating, horizon-based ranked join (HR-Join) operator for ranked twig-query execution on data graphs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation schemes and the HR-join operator for merging ranked sub-results under sum-max monotonicity.|Yan Qi 0002,K.

In such an analysis, critical numerical measures, such as profit and sales, fluctuate over time and form time-series data. Moreover, the time series data correspond to market segments, which are described by a set of attributes, such as age, gender, education, income level, and product-category, that form a multi-dimensional structure. To better understand market dynamics and predict future trends, it is crucial to study the dynamics of time-series in multi-dimensional market segments. This is a topic that has been largely ignored in time series and data cube research. In this study, we examine the issues of anomaly detection in multi-dimensional time-series data. We propose time-series data cube to capture the multi-dimensional space formed by the attribute structure. This facilitates the detection of anomalies based on expected values derived from higher level, \"more general\" time-series. Anomaly detection in a time-series data cube poses computational challenges, especially for high-dimensional, large data sets. To this end, we also propose an efficient search algorithm to iteratively select subspaces in the original high-dimensional space and detect anomalies within each one. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution.|Xiaolei Li,Jiawei Han","80852|VLDB|2007|Efficient Processing of Top-k Dominating Queries on Multi-Dimensional Data|The top-k dominating query returns k data objects which dominate the highest number of objects in a dataset.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16542|IJCAI|2007|Using the Probabilistic Logic Programming Language P-log for Causal and Counterfactual Reasoning and Non-Naive Conditioning|P-log is a probabilistic logic programming language, which combines both logic programming style knowledge representation and probabilistic reasoning.

They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

This repetition mirrors inherent geometric regularities in the physical world. For example, stimuli that excite adjacent locations on the retina map to neurons that are similarly adjacent in the visual cortex. That way, neural connectivity can exploit geometric locality in the outside world by employing local connections in the brain. If such regularities could be discovered by methods that evolve artificial neural networks (ANNs), then they could be similarly exploited to solve problems that would otherwise require optimizing too many dimensions to solve. This paper introduces such a method, called Hypercube-based Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT), which evolves a novel generative encoding called connective Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (connective CPPNs) to discover geometric regularities in the task domain. Connective CPPNs encode connectivity patterns as concepts that are independent of the number of inputs or outputs, allowing functional large-scale neural networks to be evolved. In this paper, this approach is tested in a simple visual task for which it effectively discovers the correct underlying regularity, allowing the solution to both generalize and scale without loss of function to an ANN of over eight million connections.|Jason Gauci,Kenneth O.

For example, during the time a signal travels from a peripheral sensor to the central nervous system, a moving object in the environment can cover a significant distance which can lead to critical errors in the effect of the corresponding motor output. This paper proposes that facilitating synapses which show a dynamic sensitivity to the changing input may play an important role in compensating for neural delays, through extrapolation. The idea was tested in a modified D pole-balancing problem which included sensory delays. Within this domain, we tested the behavior of recurrent neural networks with facilitatory neural dynamics trained via neuroevolution. Analysis of the performance and the evolved network parameters showed that, under various forms of delay, networks utilizing extrapolatory dynamics are at a significant competitive advantage compared to networks without such dynamics. In sum, facilitatory (or extrapolatory) dynamics can be used to compensate for delay at a single-neuron level, thus allowing a developing nervous system to stay in touch with the present environmental state.|Heejin Lim,Yoonsuck Choe"],["58215|GECCO|2007|Coupling EA and high-level metrics for the automatic generation of test blocks for peripheral cores|Test of peripheral modules has not been deeply investigated by the research community.

The approach adopted here uses an EA to evolve improvements to the solution so as to move towards an optimum solution. By using the EA to evolve gradual improvements to an existing feasible solution, a feasible solution is always maintained, an important consideration in a safety critical area such as air traffic control.|Neil Urquhart"],["16406|IJCAI|2007|Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis|Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a popular data-analytic tool for studying the class relationship between data points. A major disadvantage of LDA is that it fails to discover the local geometrical structure of the data manifold. In this paper, we introduce a novel linear algorithm for discriminant analysis, called Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA). When there is no sufficient training samples, local structure is generally more important than global structure for discriminant analysis. By discovering the local manifold structure, LSDA finds a projection which maximizes the margin between data points from different classes at each local area. Specifically, the data points are mapped into a subspace in which the nearby points with the same label are close to each other while the nearby points with different labels are far apart. Experiments carried out on several standard face databases show a clear improvement over the results of LDA-based recognition.|Deng Cai,Xiaofei He,Kun Zhou,Jiawei Han,Hujun Bao","57916|GECCO|2007|Exact analysis of the sampling distribution for the canonical particle swarm optimiser and its convergence during stagnation|Several theoretical analyses of the dynamics of particle swarms have been offered in the literature over the last decade. Virtually all rely on substantial simplifications, including the assumption that the particles are deterministic. This has prevented the exact characterisation of the sampling distribution of the PSO. In this paper we introduce a novel method, which allows one to exactly determine all the characteristics of a PSO's sampling distribution and explain how they change over any number of generations, in the presence stochasticity. The only assumption we make is stagnation, i.e., we study the sampling distribution produced by particles in search for a better personal best. We apply the analysis to the PSO with inertia weight, but the analysis is also valid for the PSO with constriction.|Riccardo Poli,David S.

We show analytically and experimentally that these two variants exhibit vastly diverging runtime behaviors for different query graphs. More specifically, each variant is superior to the other for one kind of query graph (chain or clique), but fails for the other. Moreover, neither of them handles star queries well. This motivates us to derive an algorithm that is superior to the two existing algorithms because it adapts to the search space implied by the query graph.|Guido Moerkotte,Thomas Neumann","58013|GECCO|2007|Analysis of evolutionary algorithms for the longest common subsequence problem|In the longest common subsequence problem the task is to find the longest sequence of letters that can be found as a subsequence in all members of a given finite set of sequences. The problem is one of the fundamental problems in computer science with the task of finding a given pattern in a text as an important special case. It has applications in bioinformatics problem-specific algorithms and facts about its complexity are known. Motivated by reports about good performance of evolutionary algorithms for some instances of this problem a theoretical analysis of a generic evolutionary algorithm is performed. The general algorithmic framework encompasses EAs as different as steady state GAs with uniform crossover and randomized hill-climbers. For all these algorithms it is proved that even rather simple special cases of the longest common subsequence problem can neither be solved to optimality nor approximately be solved up to an approximation factor arbitrarily close to&xa.|Thomas Jansen,Dennis Weyland","16442|IJCAI|2007|Performance Analysis of Online Anticipatory Algorithms for Large Multistage Stochastic Integer Programs|Despite significant algorithmic advances in recent years, finding optimal policies for large-scale, multistage stochastic combinatorial optimization problems remains far beyond the reach of existing methods. This paper studies a complementary approach, online anticipatory algorithms, that make decisions at each step by solving the anticipatory relaxation for a polynomial number of scenarios. Online anticipatory algorithms have exhibited surprisingly good results on a variety of applications and this paper aims at understanding their success. In particular, the paper derives sufficient conditions under which online anticipatory algorithms achieve good expected utility and studies the various types of errors arising in the algorithms including the anticipativity and sampling errors. The sampling error is shown to be negligible with a logarithmic number of scenarios. The anticipativity error is harder to bound and is shown to be low, both theoretically and experimentally, for the existing applications.|Luc Mercier,Pascal Van Hentenryck","58070|GECCO|2007|Convergence phases variance trajectories and runtime analysis of continuous EDAs|Considering the available body of literature on continuous EDAs, one must state that many important questions are still unanswered, e.g. How do continuous EDAs really work, and how can we increase their efficiency further The first question must be answered on the basis of formal models, but despite some recent results, the majority of contributions to the field is experimental. The second questionshould be answered by exploiting the insights that have been gained from formal models. We contribute to the theoretical literature on continuous EDAs by focussing on a simple, yet important, question How should the variances used tosample offspring from change over an EDA run To answer this question, the convergence process is separated into three phases and it is shown that for each phase, a preferable strategy exists for setting the variances. It is highly likely that the use of variances that have been estimated with maximum likelihood is not optimal. Thus, variance modification policies are not just a nice add-on. In the light of our findings, they become an integral component of continuous EDAs, and they should consider the specific requirements of all phases of the optimization process.|Jörn Grahl,Peter A.

These results, however, apply particularly to classical search heuristics such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Simulated Annealing. First runtime analyses of modern search heuristics have been conducted only recently w.r.t a simple Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm called -ANT. In particular, the influence of the evaporation factor in the pheromone update mechanism and the robustness of this parameter w.r.t the runtime behavior have been determined for the example function OneMax.This paper puts forward the rigorous runtime analysis of the -ANT on example functions, namely on the functions LeadingOnes and BinVal. With respect to EAs, such analyses have been essential to develop methods for the analysis on more complicated problems. The proof techniques required for the -ANT, unfortunately, differ significantly from those for EAs, which means that a new reservoir of methods has to be built up. Again, the influence of the evaporation factor is analyzed rigorously, and it is proved that its choice can be very crucial to allow efficient runtimes. Moreover, the analyses provide insight into the working principles of ACO algorithms and, in terms of their robustness, describe essential differences to other randomized search heuristics.|Benjamin Doerr,Frank Neumann,Dirk Sudholt,Carsten Witt","57825|GECCO|2006|On the analysis of the  memetic algorithm|Memetic algorithms are evolutionary algorithms incorporating local search to increase exploitation.

We compare it with the well-known (+) EA and randomized local search and show that these algorithms can outperform each other drastically.On problems like, e.g., long path problems it is essential to limit the duration of local search.

In this paper we test that hypothesis in a new setting by exploring the GA on a subset of the hdf's which are dynamic---the shaky ladder hyperplane-defined functions (sl-hdf's). In doing so we gain insight into how the GA makes use of crossover during its traversal of the sl-hdf search space. We begin this paper by explaining the sl-hdf's. We then conduct a series of experiments with various crossover rates and various rates of environmental change. Our results show that the GA performs better with than without crossover in dynamic environments. Though these results have been shown on some static functions in the past, they are re-confirmed and expanded here for a new type of function (the hdf) and a new type of environment (dynamic environments). Moreover we show that crossover is even more beneficial in dynamic environments than it is in static environments. We discuss how these results can be used to develop a richer knowledge about the use of building blocks by the GA.|William Rand,Rick L. Riolo,John H.

In this paper, we propose a unified approach to these two problems that dynamically models the objects to be manipulated and localizes the robot at the same time. Our approach applies in the common setting where only a lowresolution (cm) grid-map of a building is available, but we also have a high-resolution (.cm) model of the object to be manipulated. Our method is based on defining a unifying probabilistic model over these two representations. The resulting algorithm works in real-time, and estimates the position of objects with sufficient precision for manipulation tasks. We apply our approach to the task of navigating from one office to another (including manipulating doors). Our approach, successfully tested on multiple doors, allows the robot to navigate through a hallway to an office door, grasp and turn the door handle, and continuously manipulate the door as it moves into the office.|Anna Petrovskaya,Andrew Y.

This test suite can generate arbitrary problems with similar levels of difficulty and it provides a platform for systematic controlled observations of the GA in dynamic environments. Previous work has found two factors that contribute to the GA's success on sl-hdfs () short initial building blocks and () significantly changing the reward structure during fitness landscape changes. Therefore a test function that combines these two features should facilitate even better GA performance. This has led to the construction of a new sl-hdf variant, \"Defined Cliffs,\" in which we combine short elementary building blocks with sharp transitions in the environment. We examine this variant with two different levels of dynamics, static and regularly changing, using four different metrics. The results show superior GA performance on the Defined Cliffs over all previous variants (Cliffs, Weight, and Smooth).
