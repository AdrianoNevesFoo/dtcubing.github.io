A game manager program sends the game playing programs a description of a game's rules and objectives in a well-defined game description language. A central challenge in creating effective general game playing programs is that of constructing heuristic evaluation functions from game descriptions. This paper describes a method for constructing evaluation functions that represent exact values of simplified games. The simplified games are abstract models that incorporate the most essential aspects of the original game, namely payoff, control, and termination. Results of applying this method to a sampling of games suggest that heuristic evaluation functions based on our method are both comprehensible and effective.|James Clune","65710|AAAI|2006|Inconsistencies Negations and Changes in Ontologies|Ontology management and maintenance are considered cornerstone issues in current Semantic Web applications in which semantic integration and ontological reasoning play a fundamental role. The ability to deal with inconsistency and to accommodate change is of utmost importance in real-world applications of ontological reasoning and management, wherein the need for expressing negated assertions also arises naturally. For this purpose, precise, formal definitions of the the different types of inconsistency and negation in ontologies are required. Unfortunately, ontology languages based on Description Logics (DLs) do not provide enough expressive power to represent axiom negations. Furthermore, there is no single, well-accepted notion of inconsistency and negation in the Semantic Web community, due to the lack of a common and solid foundational framework. In this paper, we propose a general framework accounting for inconsistency, negation and change in ontologies. Different levels of negation and inconsistency in DL-based ontologies are distinguished. We demonstrate how this framework can provide a foundation for reasoning with and management of dynamic ontologies.|Giorgos Flouris,Zhisheng Huang,Jeff Z.

Among the approaches dealing with uncertainty, the one by Bacchus, Halpern and Levesque, which uses the situation calculus, is perhaps the most expressive. However, there are still some open issues. For example, it remains unclear what an agent's knowledge base would actually look like. The formalism also requires second-order logic to represent uncertain beliefs, yet a first-order representation clearly seems preferable. In this paper we show how these issues can be addressed by incorporating noisy sensors and actions into an existing logic of only-knowing.|Alfredo Gabaldon,Gerhard Lakemeyer","16371|IJCAI|2007|Cooperating Reasoning Processes More than Just the Sum of Their Parts|Using the achievements of my research group over the last + years, I provide evidence to support the following hypothesis By complementing each other, cooperating reasoning process can achieve much more than they could if they only acted individually.

Furthermore, we show that this mapping can be used to check the strong equivalence between two propositional logic programs in classical logic.|Fangzhen Lin,Yi Zhou","65836|AAAI|2006|Reasoning about Partially Observed Actions|Partially observed actions are observations of action executions in which we are uncertain about the identity of objects, agents, or locations involved in the actions (e.g., we know that action move(o, x, y) occurred, but do not know o, y). Observed-Action Reasoning is the problem of reasoning about the world state after a sequence of partial observations of actions and states. In this paper we formalize Observed-Action Reasoning, prove intractability results for current techniques, and find tractable algorithms for STRIPS and other actions. Our new algorithms update a representation of all possible world states (the belief state) in logic using new logical constants for unknown objects. A straightforward application of this idea is incorrect, and we identify and add two key amendments. We also present successful experimental results for our algorithm in Blocks-world domains of varying sizes and in Kriegspiel (partially observable chess).

However, previous results do not address the important classes of stratified programs and its subclass of acyclic (i.e., recursion-free) programs, although they are recognized as important tools for knowledge representation and reasoning. In this paper, we consider such programs, possibly augmented with constraints. Our results show that in the propositional setting, where reasoning is well-known to be polynomial, deciding strong and uniform equivalence is as hard as for arbitrary normal logic programs (and thus coNP-complete), but is polynomial in some restricted cases. Nonground programs behave similarly. However, exponential lower bounds already hold for small programs (i.e., with constantly many rules). In particular, uniform equivalence is undecidable even for small Horn programs plus a single negative constraint.|Thomas Eiter,Michael Fink,Hans Tompits,Stefan Woltran"],["65677|AAAI|2006|Computing Slater Rankings Using Similarities among Candidates|Voting (or rank aggregation) is a general method for aggregating the preferences of multiple agents. One important voting rule is the Slater rule. It selects a ranking of the alternatives (or candidates) to minimize the number of pairs of candidates such that the ranking disagrees with the pairwise majority vote on these two candidates. The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates. We show that this technique suffices to compute a Slater ranking in linear time if the pairwise majority graph is hierarchically structured. For the general case, we also give an efficient algorithm for finding a set of similar candidates. We provide experimental results that show that this technique significantly (sometimes drastically) speeds up search algorithms, Finally, we also use the technique of similar sets to show that computing an optimal Slater ranking is NP-hard. even in the absence of pairwise ties.|Vincent Conitzer","65921|AAAI|2006|Trust Representation and Aggregation in a Distributed Agent System|This paper considers a distributed system of software agents who cooperate in helping their users to find services, provided by different agents. The agents need to ensure that the service providers they select are trustworthy. Because the agents are autonomous and there is no central trusted authority, the agents help each other determine the trustworthiness of the service providers they are interested in. This help is rendered via a series of referrals to other agents, culminating in zero or more trustworthy service providers being identified. A trust network is a multiagent system where each agent potentially rates the trustworthiness of another agent. This paper develops a formal treatment of trust networks. At the base is a recently proposed representation of trust via a probability certainty distribution. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of two operators, concatenation and aggregation, using which trust ratings can be combined in a trust network. This paper motivates and establishes some important properties regarding these operators, thereby ensuring that trust can be combined correctly. Further, it shows that effects of malicious agents, who give incorrect information, are limited.|Yonghong Wang,Munindar P.

It is difficult to reach optimal outcomes in bilateral or multi-lateral negotiations over multiple resources when the agents' preferences for the resources are not common knowledge. Self-interested agents often end up negotiating inefficient agreements in such situations. We present a protocol for negotiation over multiple indivisible resources which can be used by rational agents to reach efficient outcomes. Our proposed protocol enables the negotiating agents to identify efficient solutions using systematic distributed search that visits only a subspace of the whole solution space.|Sabyasachi Saha,Sandip Sen","66107|AAAI|2007|Predictive Exploration for Autonomous Science|Often remote investigations use autonomous agents to observe an environment on behalf of absent scientists.

When the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide, we get the ranking systems setting. A famous type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines. Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered. In this paper we define three measures for quantifying the incentive compatibility of ranking systems. We apply these measures to several known ranking systems, such as PageRank, and prove tight bounds on the level of incentive compatibility under two basic properties strong monotonicity and non-imposition. We also introduce two novel nonimposing ranking systems, one general, and the other for the case of systems with three participants.

This research investigates interactions among selfish, rational, and autonomous agents in resource allocation, each with incomplete information about other entities, and each seeking to maximize its expected utility. This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","65678|AAAI|2006|Improved Bounds for Computing Kemeny Rankings|Voting (or rank aggregation) is a general method for aggregating the preferences of multiple agents.

Unfortunately, Kemeny rankings are NP-hard to compute. Recent work on computing Kemeny rankings has focused on producing good bounds to use in search-based methods. In this paper, we extend on this work by providing various improved bounding techniques. Some of these are based on cycles in the pairwise majority graph, others are based on linear programs.

An agent's preference ordering may be incomplete because, for example, there is an ongoing preference elicitation process. It may also contain incomparability as this is useful, for example, in multi-criteria scenarios. We focus on the problem of computing the possible and necessary winners, that is, those outcomes which can be or always are the most preferred for the agents. Possible and necessary winners are useful in many scenarios including preference elicitation. First we show that computing the sets of possible and necessary winners is in general a difficult problem as is providing a good approximation of such sets. Then we identify general properties of the preference aggregation function which are sufficient for such sets to be computed in polynomial time. Finally, we show how possible and necessary winners can be used to focus preference elicitation.|Maria Silvia Pini,Francesca Rossi,Kristen Brent Venable,Toby Walsh","66211|AAAI|2007|An Ironing-Based Approach to Adaptive Online Mechanism Design in Single-Valued Domains|Online mechanism design considers the problem of sequential decision making in a multi-agent system with self-interested agents.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm"],["16747|IJCAI|2007|Context-Driven Predictions|Markov models have been a keystone in Artificial Intelligence for many decades.

In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction.

Unfortunately, even approximate planning in POMDPs is known to be hard, and developing heuristic planners that can deliver reasonable results in practice has proved to be a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to approximate value-iteration for POMDP planning that is based on quadratic rather than piecewise linear function approximators. Specifically, we approximate the optimal value function by a convex upper bound composed of a fixed number of quadratics, and optimize it at each stage by semidefinite programming. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive approximation quality to current techniques while still maintaining a bounded size representation of the function approximator. Moreover, an upper bound on the optimal value function can be preserved if required. Overall, the technique requires computation time and space that is only linear in the number of iterations (horizon time).|Tao Wang,Pascal Poupart,Michael H.

A lot of effort has been made to develop approximate offline algorithms to solve ever larger POMDPs. However, even state-of-the-art approaches fail to solve large POMDPs in reasonable time. Recent developments in online POMDP search suggest that combining offline computations with online computations is often more efficient and can also considerably reduce the error made by approximate policies computed offline. In the same vein, we propose a new anytime online search algorithm which seeks to minimize, as efficiently as possible, the error made by an approximate value function computed offline. In addition, we show how previous online computations can be reused in following time steps in order to prevent redundant computations.

PSRs and mPSRs are models of non-Markovian decision processes that differ from latent-variable models (e.g. HMMs, POMDPs) by representing state using only observable quantities. Further, mPSRs explicitly represent certain structural properties of the dynamical system that are also relevant to planning.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","65906|AAAI|2006|Point-based Dynamic Programming for DEC-POMDPs|We introduce point-based dynamic programming (DP) for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDPs), a new discrete DP algorithm for planning strategies for cooperative multi-agent systems.

The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","65753|AAAI|2006|Kernel Methods for Word Sense Disambiguation and Acronym Expansion|The scarcity of manually labeled data for supervised machine learning methods presents a significant limitation on their ability to acquire knowledge.

Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes.

This paper considers transfer learning with Markov logic networks (MLNs), a powerful formalism for learning in relational domains. We present a complete MLN transfer system that first autonomously maps the predicates in the source MLN to the target domain and then revises the mapped structure to further improve its accuracy. Our results in several real-world domains demonstrate that our approach successfully reduces the amount of time and training data needed to learn an accurate model of a target domain over learning from scratch.|Lilyana Mihalkova,Tuyen N.

Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered.

Whereas social laws need to be enforced in a top-down manner, norms evolve in a bottom-up manner and are typically more self-enforcing. While effective norms can significantly enhance performance of individual agents and agent societies, there has been little work in multiagent systems on the formation of social norms. We propose a model that supports the emergence of social norms via learning from interaction experiences. In our model, individual agents repeatedly interact with other agents in the society over instances of a given scenario. Each interaction is framed as a stage game. An agent learns its policy to play the game over repeated interactions with multiple agents. We term this mode of learning social learning, which is distinct from an agent learning from repeated interactions against the same player. We are particularly interested in situations where multiple action combinations yield the same optimal payoff. The key research question is to find out if the entire population learns to converge to a consistent norm.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it.

For example, consider the problem of multirobot surveillance (Ahmadi & Stone ), in which a team of robots must collaboratively patrol a given area. If any two robots can directly communicate at all times, the robots can coordinate for efficient behavior. This condition holds trivially in environments that are smaller than the robots' communication range. However in larger environments, the robots must actively maintain physical locations such that any two robots can communicate -- possibly through a series of other robots. Otherwise, the robots may lose track of each others' activities and become miscoordinated. Furthermore, since robots are relatively unreliable andor may need to change tasks (for example if a robot is suddenly called by a human user to perform some other task), in a stable multirobot surveillance system, if one of the robots leaves or crashes, the rest should still be able to communicate. Some examples of other tasks that could benefit from any pair of robots being able to communicate with each other, are multi-robot exploration, search and rescue, and cleaning robots. We say that robot R is connected to robot R if there is a series of robots, each within communication range of the previous, which can pass a message from R to R. It is not possible to maintain connectivity in the face of arbitrary numbers of robot departures if there are any two robots that are not within communication of one another and all other robots simultaneously depart, the system becomes disconnected. Thus we focus on the property of remaining robust to any single failure under the assumption that the team can readjust its positioning in response to a departure more quickly than a second departure will occur. In order for the team to stay connected, even in the face of any single departure, it must be the case that every robot is connected to each other robot either directly or via two distinct paths that do not share any robots in common. We call this property biconnectivity the removal of any one robot from the system does not disconnect the remaining robots from each other.|Mazda Ahmadi,Peter Stone","65644|AAAI|2006|The Keystone Scavenger Team|Stereo vision for small mobile robots is a challenging problem, particularly when employing embedded systems with limited processing power.

Such a framework must also provide the students with a motivating application environment that challenges them to apply what they have learned. Robotics competitions have proven to be an excellent method for motivating students, so the framework should be portable and robust enough to be used for competitions, and flexible enough to provide a range of environments that can become more challenging as students become more adept.

However, selecting the best speed is also important - beyond its relationship to stopping distance and lateral maneuverability. Consider a high-speed ( mph) autonomous vehicle driving off-road through challenging desert terrain. The vehicle should drive slowly on terrain that poses substantial risk. However, it should not dawdle on safe terrain. In this paper we address one aspect of risk - shock to the vehicle. We present an algorithm for trading-off shock and speed in realtime and without human intervention. The trade-off is optimized using supervised learning to match human driving. The learning process is essential due to the discontinuous and spatially correlated nature of the control problem - classical techniques do not directly apply. We evaluate performance over hundreds of miles of autonomous driving, including performance during the  DARPA Grand Challenge. This approach was the deciding factor in our vehicle's speed for nearly % of the DARPA competition - more than any other constraint except the DARPA-imposed speed limits - and resulted in the fastest finishing time.|David Stavens,Gabriel Hoffmann,Sebastian Thrun","66175|AAAI|2007|An Integrated Robotic System for Spatial Understanding and Situated Interaction in Indoor Environments|A major challenge in robotics and artificial intelligence lies in creating robots that are to cooperate with people in human-populated environments, e.g. for domestic assistance or elderly care.

To provide a natural and satisfying formalization of these attitudes is a longstanding problem in the community of agent theory. Most of existing modal logic approaches are based on Kripke structures and have to face the so-called side-effect problem. This paper presents a new modal logic formalizing agents' pro attitudes, based on neighborhood models. There are three distinguishing features of this logic. Firstly, this logic naturally satisfies Bratman's requirements for agents' beliefs and pro attitudes, as well as some interesting properties that have not been discussed before. Secondly, we give a sound and complete axiom system for characterizing all the valid properties of beliefs and pro attitudes. We introduce for the first time the notion of linear neighborhood frame for obtaining the semantic model, and this brings a new member to the family of non-normal modal logics. Finally, we argue that the present logic satisfies an important requirement proposed from the viewpoint of computation, that is, computational grounding, which means that properties in this logic can be given an interpretation in terms of some concrete computational model. Indeed, the presented neighborhood frame can be naturally derived from probabilistic programming with utilities.|Kaile Su,Abdul Sattar,Han Lin,Mark Reynolds","66179|AAAI|2007|Probabilistic Modal Logic|A modal logic is any logic for handling modalities concepts like possibility, necessity, and knowledge. Artificial intelligence uses modal logics most heavily to represent and reason about knowledge of agents about others' knowledge.

In this paper we provide a formal system that represents probabilistic knowledge about probabilistic knowledge. We also present exact and approximate algorithms for reasoning about the truth value of queries that are encoded as probabilistic modal logic formulas. We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model. Then, we introduce an approximate method for applications in which we have very many or infinitely many states. Exact methods are impractical in these applications and we show that our method returns a close estimate efficiently.|Afsaneh Shirazi,Eyal Amir","16751|IJCAI|2007|The Logic Behind Weighted CSP|We define a translation from Weighted CSP to signed Max-SAT, and a complete resolution-style calculus for solving signed Max-SAT.

Second, we define a restriction and a generalization of the previous rule called, respectively, signed Max-SAT i-consistency resolution and signed Max-SAT (i,j)-consistency resolution. These rules have the following property if a WCSP signed encoding is closed under signed Max-SAT i-consistency, then the WCSP is i-consistent, and if it is closed under signed Max-SAT (i,j)-consistency, then the WCSP is (i,j)-consistent. A new and practical insight derived from the definition of these new rules is that algorithms for enforcing high order consistency should incorporate an efficient and effective component for detecting minimal unsatisfiable cores.

We consider the case where data is sampled from a low dimensional manifold which is embedded in high dimensional Euclidean space. The most popular manifold learning algorithms include Locally Linear Embedding, ISOMAP, and Laplacian Eigenmap. However, these algorithms are nonlinear and only provide the embedding results of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, called Isometric Projection. Isometric Projection constructs a weighted data graph where the weights are discrete approximations of the geodesic distances on the data manifold. A linear subspace is then obtained by preserving the pairwise distances. In this way, Isometric Projection can be defined everywhere. Comparing to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which is widely used in data processing, our algorithm is more capable of discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure. Specially, PCA is optimal only when the data space is linear, while our algorithm has no such assumption and therefore can handle more complex data space.

However, probabilistic inference methods like MCMC or belief propagation tend to give poor results when deterministic or near-deterministic dependencies are present, and logical ones like satisfiability testing are inapplicable to probabilistic ones. In this paper we propose MC-SAT, an inference algorithm that combines ideas from MCMC and satisfiability. MC-SAT is based on Markov logic, which defines Markov networks using weighted clauses in first-order logic. From the point of view of MCMC, MC-SAT is a slice sampler with an auxiliary variable per clause, and with a satisfiability-based method for sampling the original variables given the auxiliary ones. From the point of view of satisfiability, MCSAT wraps a procedure around the SampleSAT uniform sampler that enables it to sample from highly non-uniform distributions over satisfying assignments.

It vastly generalizes the NP-complete problem of propositional satisfiability, and hence is both highly useful and extremely expensive to solve in practice. We present a new approach to model counting that is based on adding a carefully chosen number of so-called streamlining constraints to the input formula in order to cut down the size of its solution space in a controlled manner. Each of the additional constraints is a randomly chosen XOR or parity constraint on the problem variables, represented either directly or in the standard CNF form. Inspired by a related yet quite different theoretical study of the properties of XOR constraints, we provide a formal proof that with high probability, the number of XOR constraints added in order to bring the formula to the boundary of being unsatisfiable determines with high precision its model count. Experimentally, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to obtain good bounds on the model counts for formulas that are far beyond the reach of exact counting methods. In fact, we obtain the first non-trivial solution counts for very hard, highly structured combinatorial problem instances.

We further show that data-structure techniques recently used to speed up kernel machine approaches are well matched to the algorithm by reducing the dominant costs of training function evaluation and RKHS inner product computation.|Nathan D.

Specifically, we examine situations where an agent and human attempt to coordinate their choices among several alternatives with equivalent utilities. We use machine learning algorithms to help the agent predict human choices in these tactic coordination domains. Learning to classify general human choices, however, is very difficult. Nevertheless, humans are often able to coordinate with one another in communication-free games, by using focal points, \"prominent\" solutions to coordination problems. We integrate focal points into the machine learning process, by transforming raw domain data into a new hypothesis space. This results in classifiers with an improved classification rate and shorter training time. Integration of focal points into learning algorithms also results in agents that are more robust to changes in the environment.|Inon Zuckerman,Sarit Kraus,Jeffrey S.

Although numerous diverse techniques have been proposed, a fast tree-growing algorithm without substantial decrease in accuracy and substantial increase in space complexity is essential. In this paper, we present a novel, fast decision-tree learning algorithm that is based on a conditional independence assumption. The new algorithm has a time complexity of O(m  n), where m is the size of the training data and n is the number of attributes. This is a significant asymptotic improvement over the time complexity O(m  n) of the standard decision-tree learning algorithm C., with an additional space increase of only O(n). Experiments show that our algorithm performs competitively with C. in accuracy on a large number of UCI benchmark data sets, and performs even better and significantly faster than C. on a large number of text classification data sets. The time complexity of our algorithm is as low as naive Bayes'. Indeed, it is as fast as naive Bayes but outperforms naive Bayes in accuracy according to our experiments.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","66198|AAAI|2007|Mapping and Revising Markov Logic Networks for Transfer Learning|Transfer learning addresses the problem of how to leverage knowledge acquired in a source domain to improve the accuracy and speed of learning in a related target domain.

In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal. Our experimental results show that TVI outperforms VI, LAO, LRTDP and HDP on our benchmark MDPs.|Peng Dai,Judy Goldsmith","16367|IJCAI|2007|A Fast Analytical Algorithm for Solving Markov Decision Processes with Real-Valued Resources|Agents often have to construct plans that obey deadlines or, more generally, resource limits for real-valued resources whose consumption can only be characterized by probability distributions, such as execution time or battery power. These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.|Janusz Marecki,Sven Koenig,Milind Tambe","16759|IJCAI|2007|Using Linear Programming for Bayesian Exploration in Markov Decision Processes|A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge.

In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming.

OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings.

For example, consider the problem of multirobot surveillance (Ahmadi & Stone ), in which a team of robots must collaboratively patrol a given area. If any two robots can directly communicate at all times, the robots can coordinate for efficient behavior. This condition holds trivially in environments that are smaller than the robots' communication range. However in larger environments, the robots must actively maintain physical locations such that any two robots can communicate -- possibly through a series of other robots. Otherwise, the robots may lose track of each others' activities and become miscoordinated. Furthermore, since robots are relatively unreliable andor may need to change tasks (for example if a robot is suddenly called by a human user to perform some other task), in a stable multirobot surveillance system, if one of the robots leaves or crashes, the rest should still be able to communicate. Some examples of other tasks that could benefit from any pair of robots being able to communicate with each other, are multi-robot exploration, search and rescue, and cleaning robots. We say that robot R is connected to robot R if there is a series of robots, each within communication range of the previous, which can pass a message from R to R. It is not possible to maintain connectivity in the face of arbitrary numbers of robot departures if there are any two robots that are not within communication of one another and all other robots simultaneously depart, the system becomes disconnected. Thus we focus on the property of remaining robust to any single failure under the assumption that the team can readjust its positioning in response to a departure more quickly than a second departure will occur. In order for the team to stay connected, even in the face of any single departure, it must be the case that every robot is connected to each other robot either directly or via two distinct paths that do not share any robots in common. We call this property biconnectivity the removal of any one robot from the system does not disconnect the remaining robots from each other.|Mazda Ahmadi,Peter Stone","16726|IJCAI|2007|Combining Learning and Word Sense Disambiguation for Intelligent User Profiling|Understanding user interests from text documents can provide support to personalized information recommendation services. Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","65828|AAAI|2006|Intuitive linguistic Joint Object Reference in Human-Robot Interaction Human Spatial Reference Systems and Function-Based Categorization for Symbol Grounding|The visionary goal of an easy to use service robot implies intuitive styles of interaction between humans and robots.

Part of bridging this gap consists of allowing user and robot to establish joint reference on objects in the environment - without forcing the user to use unnatural means for object reference. We present an approach to establishing joint object reference which makes use of natural object classification and a computational model of basic intrinsic and relative reference systems. Our object recognition approach assigns natural categories (e.g. \"desk\", \"chair\", \"table\") to new objects based on their functional design.

Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions.

However, most of these systems do not generally adapt to new circumstances, do not self-evaluate and self-configure their own strategies, and do not monitor the usage history of the learning content being delivered or presented to the students. These shortcomings force ITS developers to often spend much development time in manual revision and fine-tuning of the learning and instructional contents of an ITS. In this paper, we describe an intelligent agent that delivers learning material adaptively to different students, factoring in the usage history of the learning materials and student profiles as observed by the agent. Student-tutor interaction includes the activities of going through learning material, such as a topical tutorial, a set of examples, and a set of problems.

Using an integrated introspective case-based reasoning approach, our agent further learns from its experience and refines its reasoning process-including the instructional strategies-to adapt to student needs. Moreover, our agent monitors the usage history of the learning materials to improve its performance.

In this paper we provide a technique for accomplishing this objective. Our technique can deal with a rich class of preferences, including so-called temporally extended preferences (TEPs). Unlike simple preferences which express desired properties of the final state achieved by a plan, TEPs can express desired properties of the entire sequence of states traversed by a plan, allowing the user to express a much richer set of preferences. Our technique involves converting a planning problem with TEPs into an equivalent planning problem containing only simple preferences. This conversion is accomplished by augmenting the inputed planning domain with a new set of predicates and actions for updating these predicates. We then provide a collection of new heuristics and a specialized search algorithm that can guide the planner towards preferred plans. Under some fairly general conditions our method is able to find a most preferred plan-i.e., an optimal plan. It can accomplish this without having to resort to admissible heuristics, which often perform poorly in practice. Nor does our technique require an assumption of restricted plan length or make-span. We have implemented our approach in the HPlan-P planning system and used it to compete in the th International Planning Competition, where it achieved distinguished performance in the Qualitative Preferences track.|Jorge A.

We adapt the classical notion of set bounds consistency for WCSPs, and propose efficient representation schemes for set variables and common unary, binary, and ternary set constraints, as well as cardinality constraints. Instead of reasoning consistency on an entire set variable directly, we propose local consistency check at the set element level, and demonstrate that this apparent \"micro\"-management of consistency does imply set bounds consistency at the variable level. In addition, we prove that our framework captures classical CSPs with set variables, and degenerates to the classical case when the weights in the problem contain only  and T. Last but not least, we verify the feasibility and efficiency of our proposal with a prototype implementation, the efficiency of which is competitive against ILOG Solver on classical problems and orders of magnitude better than WCSP models using - variables to simulate set variables on soft problems.|J.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

These approaches generalize the fixpoint-based and the level mapping based answer set semantics of normal logic programs to the case of logic programs with arbitrary types of c-atoms. The results are four different answer set definitions which are equivalent when applied to normal logic programs. The standard fixpoint-based semantics of logic programs is generalized in two directions, called answer set by reduct and answer set by complement. These definitions, which differ from each other in the treatment of negation-as-failure (naf) atoms, make use of an immediate consequence operator to perform answer set checking, whose definition relies on the notion of conditional satisfaction of c-atoms w.r.t. a pair of interpretations. The other two definitions, called strongly and weakly well-supported models, are generalizations of the notion of well-supported models of normal logic programs to the case of programs with c-atoms. As for the case of fixpoint-based semantics, the difference between these two definitions is rooted in the treatment of naf atoms. We prove that answer sets by reduct (resp. by complement) are equivalent to weakly (resp. strongly) well-supported models of a program, thus generalizing the theorem on the correspondence between stable models and well-supported models of a normal logic program to the class of programs with c-atoms. We show that the newly defined semantics coincide with previously introduced semantics for logic programs with monotone c-atoms, and they extend the original answer set semantics of normal logic programs. We also study some properties of answer sets of programs with c-atoms, and relate our definitions to several semantics for logic programs with aggregates presented in the literature.|Tran Cao Son,Enrico Pontelli,Phan Huy Tu"],["65757|AAAI|2006|Diagnosis of Multi-Robot Coordination Failures Using Distributed CSP Algorithms|With increasing deployment of systems involving multiple coordinating agents, there is a growing need for diagnosing coordination failures in such systems.

Discovering such inherent community structures can lead to deeper understanding about the networks and therefore has raised increasing interests among researchers from various disciplines.

In this model, communities are modeled as latent variables and defined as distributions over the social actor space. In addition, each social actor belongs to every community with different probability. This paper also proposes two different network encoding approaches and explores the impact of these two approaches to the community discovery performance. This model is evaluated on two research collaborative networks CiteSeer and NanoSCI.

Assessing the relatedness of texts in this space amounts to comparing the corresponding vectors using conventional metrics (e.g., cosine). Compared with the previous state of the art, using ESA results in substantial improvements in correlation of computed relatedness scores with human judgments from r  . to . for individual words and from r  . to . for texts.

Many online solutions for this problem make use of simplifying assumptions, such as Gaussian noise models and linear system behaviour and also adopt a filtering strategy which may not use available information optimally. These assumptions allow near real-time inference, while also limiting accuracy and introducing the potential for ill-conditioning and divergence. We consider augmenting a particular real-time estimation method, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), with a more complex, but more highly accurate, inference technique based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. Conventional MCMC techniques applied to this problem can entail significant and time consuming computation to achieve convergence. To address this, we propose an intelligent bootstrapping process and the use of parallel, communicative chains of different temperatures, commonly referred to as parallel tempering.

Our proposed method first anchors the appearance of entities in Wikipedia articles using some heuristic rules that are supported by their encyclopedic style. Therefore, it uses neither the Named Entity Recognizer (NER) nor the Coreference Resolution tool, which are sources of errors for relation extraction. It then classifies the relationships among entity pairs using SVM with features extracted from the web structure and subtrees mined from the syntactic structure of text. The innovations behind our work are the following a) our method makes use of Wikipedia characteristics for entity allocation and entity classification, which are essential for relation extraction b) our algorithm extracts a core tree, which accurately reflects a relationship between a given entity pair, and subsequently identifies key features with respect to the relationship from the core tree.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to provide the optimal solution, however such method fails when the state space and action space are huge. We apply a form of NeuroEvolution (NE) algorithm to inductively learn the CAC policies, which is called CN (Call Admission Control scheme using NE). Comparing with the Q-Learning based CAC scheme in the constant traffic load shows that CN can not only approximate the optimal solution very well but also optimize the CBR and CDR in a more flexibility way. Additionally the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of keeping the handoff dropping rate below a pre-specified value while still maintaining an acceptable CBR in the presence of smoothly varying arrival rates of traffic, in which the state space is too large for practical deployment of the other learning scheme.|Xu Yang,John Bigham","66239|AAAI|2007|Detecting Execution Failures Using Learned Action Models|Planners reason with abstracted models of the behaviours they use to construct plans.

In this paper we present an approach by which a trace of the execution of a behaviour is monitored by tracking its most likely explanation through a learned model of how the behaviour is normally executed. In this way, possible failures are identified as deviations from common patterns of the execution of the behaviour. We perform an experiment in which we inject errors into the behaviour of a robot performing a particular task, and explore how well a learned model of the task can detect where these errors occur.|Maria Fox,Jonathan Gough,Derek Long","65899|AAAI|2006|WikiRelate Computing Semantic Relatedness Using Wikipedia|Wikipedia provides a knowledge base for computing word relatedness in a more structured fashion than a search engine and with more coverage than WordNet.

Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16801|IJCAI|2007|Common Sense Based Joint Training of Human Activity Recognizers|Given sensors to detect object use, commonsense priors of object usage in activities can reduce the need for labeled data in learning activity models.

When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

Indeed, in recent years depth-first ANDOR Branch-and-Bound algorithms were shown to be very effective when exploring such search spaces, especially when using caching. Since best-first strategies are known to be superior to depth-first when memory is utilized, exploring the best-first control strategy is called for. In this paper we introduce two classes of best-first ANDOR search algorithms those that explore a context-minimal ANDOR search graph and use static variable orderings, and those that use dynamic variable orderings but explore an ANDOR search tree.

This paper describes how a joint intention interpreter that is integrated with a reasoner over beliefs and communicative acts can form the core of a dialogue engine. As an interpreter of joint actions, the architecture enables agent programmers to describe a domain declaratively, specifying an agent's individual and joint intentions, plans and actions at a high level. The interpreter attempts to fulfill the agent's individual and joint intentions, subject to its beliefs and mutual beliefs. As a consequence, the system engages in dialogue through the planning and execution of communicative acts necessary to attain the collaborative task at hand. The dialogue engine is general enough to be applicable to both agent-agent and agent-human teams.

Although this approach to verification is explicitly concerned with changing beliefs, formal belief change operators have not been incorporated in previous work. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to protocol verification by combining a monotonic logic with a non-monotonic belief change operator.

These approaches generalize the fixpoint-based and the level mapping based answer set semantics of normal logic programs to the case of logic programs with arbitrary types of c-atoms. The results are four different answer set definitions which are equivalent when applied to normal logic programs. The standard fixpoint-based semantics of logic programs is generalized in two directions, called answer set by reduct and answer set by complement. These definitions, which differ from each other in the treatment of negation-as-failure (naf) atoms, make use of an immediate consequence operator to perform answer set checking, whose definition relies on the notion of conditional satisfaction of c-atoms w.r.t. a pair of interpretations. The other two definitions, called strongly and weakly well-supported models, are generalizations of the notion of well-supported models of normal logic programs to the case of programs with c-atoms. As for the case of fixpoint-based semantics, the difference between these two definitions is rooted in the treatment of naf atoms. We prove that answer sets by reduct (resp. by complement) are equivalent to weakly (resp. strongly) well-supported models of a program, thus generalizing the theorem on the correspondence between stable models and well-supported models of a normal logic program to the class of programs with c-atoms. We show that the newly defined semantics coincide with previously introduced semantics for logic programs with monotone c-atoms, and they extend the original answer set semantics of normal logic programs. We also study some properties of answer sets of programs with c-atoms, and relate our definitions to several semantics for logic programs with aggregates presented in the literature.|Tran Cao Son,Enrico Pontelli,Phan Huy Tu","66012|AAAI|2007|The Modal Logic SF the Default Logic and the Logic Here-and-There|The modal logic SF provides an account for the default logic of Reiter, and several modal nonmonotonic logics of knowledge and belief. In this paper we focus on a fragment of the logic SF concerned with modal formulas called modal defaults, and on sets of modal defaults -- modal default theories. We present characterizations of SF-expansions of modal default theories, and show that strong and uniform equivalence of modal default theories can be expressed in terms of the logical equivalence in the logic SF. We argue that the logic SF can be viewed as the general default logic of nested defaults. We also study special modal default theories called modal programs, and show that this fragment of the logic SF generalizes the logic here-and-there.|Miroslaw Truszczynski","16752|IJCAI|2007|A Description Logic of Change|We combine the modal logic S with the description logic (DL) ALCQI. The resulting multi-dimensional DL SALCQI supports reasoning about change by allowing to express that concepts and roles change over time. It cannot, however, discriminate between changes in the past and in the future. Our main technical result is that satisfiability of SALCQI concepts with respect to general TBoxes (including GCIs) is decidable and -EXPTIME-complete. In contrast, reasoning in temporal DLs that are able to discriminate between past and future is inherently undecidable. We argue that our logic is sufficient for reasoning about temporal conceptual models with time-stamping constraints.|Alessandro Artale,Carsten Lutz,David Toman"],["65783|AAAI|2006|Trip Router with Individualized Preferences TRIP Incorporating Personalization into Route Planning|Popular route planning systems (Windows Live Local, Yahoo Maps, Google Maps, etc.) generate driving directions using a static library of roads and road attributes. They ignore both the time at which a route is to be traveled and, more generally, the preferences of the drivers they serve. We present a set of methods for including driver preferences and time-variant traffic condition estimates in route planning. These methods have been incorporated into a working prototype named TRIP. Using a large database of GPS traces logged by drivers, TRIP learns time-variant traffic speeds for every road in a widespread metropolitan area. It also leverages a driver's past GPS logs when responding to future route queries to produce routes that are more suited to the driver's individual driving preferences. Using experiments with real driving data, we demonstrate that the routes produced by TRIP are measurably closer to those actually chosen by drivers than are the routes produced by routers that use static heuristics.|Julia Letchner,John Krumm,Eric Horvitz","16753|IJCAI|2007|A Heuristic Search Approach to Planning with Temporally Extended Preferences|Planning with preferences involves not only finding a plan that achieves the goal, it requires finding a preferred plan that achieves the goal, where preferences over plans are specified as part of the planner's input. In this paper we provide a technique for accomplishing this objective. Our technique can deal with a rich class of preferences, including so-called temporally extended preferences (TEPs). Unlike simple preferences which express desired properties of the final state achieved by a plan, TEPs can express desired properties of the entire sequence of states traversed by a plan, allowing the user to express a much richer set of preferences. Our technique involves converting a planning problem with TEPs into an equivalent planning problem containing only simple preferences. This conversion is accomplished by augmenting the inputed planning domain with a new set of predicates and actions for updating these predicates. We then provide a collection of new heuristics and a specialized search algorithm that can guide the planner towards preferred plans. Under some fairly general conditions our method is able to find a most preferred plan-i.e., an optimal plan. It can accomplish this without having to resort to admissible heuristics, which often perform poorly in practice. Nor does our technique require an assumption of restricted plan length or make-span. We have implemented our approach in the HPlan-P planning system and used it to compete in the th International Planning Competition, where it achieved distinguished performance in the Qualitative Preferences track.|Jorge A.

McIlraith","65844|AAAI|2006|Compiling Uncertainty Away Solving Conformant Planning Problems using a Classical Planner Sometimes|Even under polynomial restrictions on plan length, conformant planning remains a very hard computational problem as plan verification itself can take exponential time. This heavy price cannot be avoided in general although in many cases conformant plans are verifiable efficiently by means of simple forms of disjunctive inference. This raises the question of whether it is possible to identify and use such forms of inference for developing an efficient but incomplete planner capable of solving non-trivial problems quickly. In this work, we show that this is possible by mapping conformant into classical problems that are then solved by an off-the-shelf classical planner. The formulation is sound as the classical plans obtained are all conformant, but it is incomplete as the inverse relation does not always hold. The translation accommodates 'reasoning by cases' by means of an 'split-protect-and-merge' strategy namely, atoms LXi that represent conditional beliefs 'if Xi then L' are introduced in the classical encoding, that are combined by suitable actions to yield the literal L when the disjunction X  ...  Xn holds and certain invariants in the plan are verified. Empirical results over a wide variety of problems illustrate the power of the approach.|Héctor Palacios,Hector Geffner","65792|AAAI|2006|PPCP Efficient Probabilistic Planning with Clear Preferences in Partially-Known Environments|For most real-world problems the agent operates in only partially-known environments. Probabilistic planners can reason over the missing information and produce plans that take into account the uncertainty about the environment. Unfortunately though, they can rarely scale up to the problems that are of interest in real-world. In this paper, however, we show that for a certain subset of problems we can develop a very efficient probabilistic planner. The proposed planner, called PPCP, is applicable to the problems for which it is clear what values of the missing information would result in the best plan. In other words, there exists a clear preference for the actual values of the missing information. For example, in the problem of robot navigation in partially-known environments it is always preferred to find out that an initially unknown location is traversable rather than not. The planner we propose exploits this property by using a series of deterministic A*-like searches to construct and refine a policy in anytime fashion. On the theoretical side, we show that once converged, the policy is guaranteed to be optimal under certain conditions. On the experimental side, we show the power of PPCP on the problem of robot navigation in partially-known terrains. The planner can scale up to very large environments with thousands of initially unknown locations. We believe that this is several orders of magnitude more unknowns than what the current probabilistic planners developed for the same problem can handle. Also, despite the fact that the problem we experimented on in general does not satisfy the conditions for the solution optimality, PPCP still produces the solutions that are nearly always optimal.|Maxim Likhachev,Anthony Stentz","16530|IJCAI|2007|Fast Incremental Algorithms for Useful Classes of Simple Temporal Problems with Preferences|In this paper, we will provide a fast polynomialtime algorithm for solving simple temporal problems (STPs) with piecewise linear convex preference functions and a utilitarian objective function. Our algorithm is motivated by the study of the linear programming (LP)-dual of a given mincost circulation problem (MCCP). We will also show how this duality relationship between simple temporal problems with preferences (STPPs) and MCCPs leads to fast incremental algorithms for solving the former. Our algorithms bear important implications in planning, scheduling and execution monitoring scenarios where (partial) plans are subject to repeated changes, and the most preferred solutions to the underlying STPPs have to be computed and updated fast (incrementally).|T.

To reduce the complexity of solving a large PDDL planning problem, constraint partitioning can be used to decompose its constraints into subproblems of much lower complexity. However, constraint locality due to soft goals and trajectory constraints cannot be effectively exploited by existing subgoal-partitioning techniques developed for solving PDDL. problems. In this paper, we present an improved partition-andresolve strategy for supporting the new features in PDDL. We evaluate techniques for resolving violated global constraints, optimizing goal preferences, and achieving subgoals in a multivalued representation. Empirical results on the th International Planning Competition (IPC) benchmarks show that our approach is effective and significantly outperforms other competing planners.|Chih-Wei Hsu,Benjamin W. Wah,Ruoyun Huang,Yixin Chen","16503|IJCAI|2007|Reducing Accidental Complexity in Planning Problems|Although even propositional STRIPS planning is a hard problem in general, many instances of the problem, including many of those commonly used as benchmarks, are easy. In spite of this, they are often hard to solve for domain-independent planners, because the encoding of the problem into a general problem specification formalism such as STRIPS hides structure that needs to be exploited to solve problems easily. We investigate the use of automatic problem transformations to reduce this \"accidental\" problem complexity. The main tool is abstraction we identify a new, weaker, condition under which abstraction is \"safe\", in the sense that any solution to the abstracted problem can be refined to a concrete solution (in polynomial time, for most cases) and also show how different kinds of problem reformulations can be applied to create greater opportunities for such safe abstraction.|Patrik Haslum","65875|AAAI|2006|Contingent Planning with Goal Preferences|The importance of the problems of contingent planning with actions that have non-deterministic effects and of planning with goal preferences has been widely recognized, and several works address these two problems separately. However, combining conditional planning with goal preferences adds some new difficulties to the problem. Indeed, even the notion of optimal plan is far from trivial, since plans in nondeterministic domains can result in several different behaviors satisfying conditions with different preferences. Planning for optimal conditional plans must therefore take into account the different behaviors, and conditionally search for the highest preference that can be achieved. In this paper, we address this problem. We formalize the notion of optimal conditional plan, and we describe a correct and complete planning algorithm that is guaranteed to find optimal solutions. We implement the algorithm using BDD-based techniques, and show the practical potentialities of our approach through a preliminary experimental evaluation.|Dmitry Shaparau,Marco Pistore,Paolo Traverso","65772|AAAI|2006|Controlled Search over Compact State Representations in Nondeterministic Planning Domains and Beyond|Two of the most efficient planners for planning in nondeterministic domains are MBP and ND-SHOP. MBP achieves its efficiency by using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) to represent sets of states that share some common properties, so it can plan for all of these states simultaneously. ND-SHOP achieves its efficiency by using HTN task decomposition to focus the search. In some environments, ND-SHOP runs exponentially faster than MBP, and in others the reverse is true. In this paper, we discuss the following  We describe how to combine ND-SHOP's HTNs with MBP's BDDs. Our new planning algorithm, YoYo, performs task decompositions over classes of states that are represented as BDDs. In our experiments, YoYo easily outperformed both MBP and ND-SHOP, often by several orders of magnitude.  HTNs are just one of several techniques that are originally developed for classical planning domains and that can be adapted to work in nondeterministic domains. By combining those techniques with a BDD representation, it should be possible to get great speedups just as we did here. We discuss how these same ideas can be generalized for use in several other research areas, such as planning with Markov Decision Processes, synthesizing controllers for hybrid systems, and composing Semantic Web Services.|Ugur Kuter,Dana S.

In this paper we extend the Planning as Satisfiability approach in order to handle preferences and SATPLAN in order to solve problems with simple preferences. The resulting system, SATPLAN(P) is competitive with SGPLAN, the winning system in the category \"simple preferences\" at the last IPC. Further, we show that SATPLAN(P) performances are (almost) always comparable to those of SATPLAN when solving the same problems without preferences in other words, introducing simple preferences in SATPLAN does not affect its performances. This latter result is due both to the particular mechanism we use in order to incorporate preferences in SAT-PLAN and to the relative low number of soft goals (each corresponding to a simple preference) usually present in planning problems. Indeed, if we consider the issue of determining minimal plans (corresponding to problems with thousands of preferences) the performances of SATPLAN(P) are comparable to those of SATPLAN in many cases, but can be significantly worse when the number of preferences is very high compared to the total number of variables in the problem. Our analysis is conducted considering both qualitative and quantitative preferences, different reductions from quantitative to qualitative ones, and most of the propositional planning domains from the IPCs and that SATPLAN can handle.|Enrico Giunchiglia,Marco Maratea"]]}}
