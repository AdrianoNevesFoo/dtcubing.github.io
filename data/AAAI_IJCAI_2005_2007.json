Although support vector machines (SVMs) have been a dominant machine learning technique for the past decade, they have generally been applied to supervised learning problems. Developing unsupervised extensions to SVMs has in fact proved to be difficult. In this paper, we present a principled approach to unsupervised SVM training by formulating convex relaxations of the natural training criterion find a labeling that would yield an optimal SVM classifier on the resulting training data. The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well. While previous work has concentrated on the two-class case, we present a general, multi-class formulation that can be applied to a wider range of natural data sets. The resulting training procedures are computationally intensive, but produce high quality generalization results.|Linli Xu,Dale Schuurmans","16672|IJCAI|2007|Feature Mining and Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System for Steganalysis of LSB Matching Stegangoraphy in Grayscale Images|In this paper, we present a scheme based on feature mining and neuro-fuzzy inference system for detecting LSB matching steganography in grayscale images, which is a very challenging problem in steganalysis. Four types of features are proposed, and a Dynamic Evolving Neural Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS) based feature selection is proposed, as well as the use of Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) to obtain better detection accuracy. In comparison with other well-known features, overall, our features perform the best. DENFIS outperforms some traditional learning classifiers. SVM-RFE and DENFIS based feature selection outperform statistical significance based feature selection such as t-test.

However, the development of SANNs has traditionally focused on data domains that are assumed to be modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of data governed by other statistical models, such as the Poisson distribution, has received less attention from the data mining community. Based on special considerations of the statistical nature of data following a Poisson distribution, this paper introduces a SANN, Poisson-based Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (PSOTA), which implements novel similarity matching criteria and neuron weight adaptation schemes. It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood. This study indicate that, in comparison to the traditional Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA), PSOTA offers significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization in data modeled by the Poisson distribution, such as serial analysis of gene expression data.|Haiying Wang,Huiru Zheng,Francisco Azuaje","16489|IJCAI|2007|A Theoretical Framework for Learning Bayesian Networks with Parameter Inequality Constraints|The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data. Domain knowledge can come in many forms. For example, expert knowledge about the relevance of variables relative to a certain problem can help perform better feature selection. Domain knowledge about the conditional independence relationships among variables can help learning of the Bayesian Network structure. This paper considers a different type of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian Networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that comes in the form of inequality constraints among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian Network with known structure. These parameter constraints are incorporated into learning procedures for Bayesian Networks, by formulating this task as a constrained optimization problem. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of closed form Maximum Likelihood parameter estimators in the above setting.|Radu Stefan Niculescu,Tom M. Mitchell,R.

They allow a system to take advantage of prior domain knowledge supplied either by a human user or another algorithm, combining that knowledge with data to produce accurate models. A limitation of the use of prior knowledge occurs when the provided knowledge is incorrect. Such knowledge likely still contains useful information, but knowledge-based learners might not be able to fully exploit such information. In fact, incorrect knowledge can lead to poorer models than result from knowledge-free learners. We present a support-vector method for incorporating and refining domain knowledge that not only allows the learner to make use of that knowledge, but also suggests changes to the provided knowledge. Our approach is built on the knowledge-based classification and regression methods presented by Fung, Mangasarian, & Shavlik ( ) and by Mangasarian, Shavlik, & Wild (). Experiments on artificial data sets with known properties, as well as on a real-world data set, demonstrate that our method learns more accurate models while also adjusting the provided rules in intuitive ways. Our new algorithm provides an appealing extension to knowledge-based, support-vector learning that is not only able to combine knowledge from rules with data, but is also able to use the data to modify and change those rules to better fit the data.|Richard Maclin,Edward W.

Recently, it is also used for multi-instance (MI) learning by employing a kernel that is defined directly on the bags. As only the bags (but not the instances) have known labels, this MI kernel implicitly assumes all instances in the bag to be equally important. However, a fundamental property of MI learning is that not all instances in a positive bag necessarily belong to the positive class, and thus different instances in the same bag should have different contributions to the kernel. In this paper, we address this instance label ambiguity by using the method of marginalized kernels. It first assumes that all the instance labels are available and defines a label-dependent kernel on the instances. By integrating out the unknown instance labels, a marginalized kernel defined on the bags can then be obtained. A desirable property is that this kernel weights the instance pairs by the consistencies of their probabilistic instance labels. Experiments on both classification and regression data sets show that this marginalized MI kernel, when used in a standard SVM, performs consistently better than the original MI kernel. It also outperforms a number of traditional MI learning methods.|James T. Kwok,Pak-Ming Cheung","16796|IJCAI|2007|Parametric Kernels for Sequence Data Analysis|A key challenge in applying kernel-based methods for discriminative learning is to identify a suitable kernel given a problem domain. Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design. Our contribution is the introduction of a general technique for designing SVM kernels tailored for the classification of sequence data.|Young-In Shin,Donald S.

Artificial intelligence uses modal logics most heavily to represent and reason about knowledge of agents about others' knowledge. This type of reasoning occurs in dialog, collaboration, and competition. In many applications it is also important to be able to reason about the probability of beliefs and events. In this paper we provide a formal system that represents probabilistic knowledge about probabilistic knowledge. We also present exact and approximate algorithms for reasoning about the truth value of queries that are encoded as probabilistic modal logic formulas. We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model. Then, we introduce an approximate method for applications in which we have very many or infinitely many states. Exact methods are impractical in these applications and we show that our method returns a close estimate efficiently.|Afsaneh Shirazi,Eyal Amir","65469|AAAI|2005|Description Logic-Ground Knowledge Integration and Management|This abstract describes ongoing work in developing large-scale knowledge repositories.

A dialogue game making use of the framework and a utility based heuristic for playing the dialogue game are also presented. We then show how these components can be applied to contract monitoring. The dialogues that emerge bear some similarity to the dialogues that occur when humans argue about contracts, and our approach is highly suited to complex, partially observable domains with fallible sensors where determining environment state cannot be done for free.|Nir Oren,Timothy J.

This paper proposes two methods that enable the domain expert, who is nonexpert in artificial intelligence (AI), to interactively supervise the knowledge validation process in a CBR system, and to enable dynamic updating of the system, to provide the best diagnostic questions. The first method is based on formal concept analysis which involves a graphical representation and comparison of the concepts, and a summary description highlighting the conceptual differences. We propose a dissimilarity metric for measuring the degree of variation between the previous and current concepts when a new case is added to the knowledge base. The second method involves determining unexpected classification-based association rules to form critical questions as the knowledge base gets updated.|Monica H. Ou,Geoff A. W.

Moreover, they constitute an important part of available knowledge. We show in this paper how this knowledge can be appropriately represented by graphs and fuzzy models of spatial relations, which are integrated in a reasoning process to guide the recognition of individual structures in images. However pathological cases may deviate substantially from generic knowledge. We propose a method to adapt the knowledge representation to take into account the influence of the pathologies on the spatial organization of a set of structures, based on learning procedures.

In this paper, we consider such programs, possibly augmented with constraints. Our results show that in the propositional setting, where reasoning is well-known to be polynomial, deciding strong and uniform equivalence is as hard as for arbitrary normal logic programs (and thus coNP-complete), but is polynomial in some restricted cases. Nonground programs behave similarly. However, exponential lower bounds already hold for small programs (i.e., with constantly many rules). In particular, uniform equivalence is undecidable even for small Horn programs plus a single negative constraint.|Thomas Eiter,Michael Fink,Hans Tompits,Stefan Woltran","66175|AAAI|2007|An Integrated Robotic System for Spatial Understanding and Situated Interaction in Indoor Environments|A major challenge in robotics and artificial intelligence lies in creating robots that are to cooperate with people in human-populated environments, e.g. for domestic assistance or elderly care.

Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy.

For ambiguous queries, a traditional approach is to organize search results into groups (clusters), one for each meaning of the query. These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate.

This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids.

Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision. We present empirical evidence illustrating that the performance of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and timeliness is improved significantly by utilizing POMDPs.|Masoumeh T.

The dominant approaches include propositional satisfiability (SAT), constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), and answer set programming (ASP). Here, we propose a declarative constraint programming framework which we believe combines many strengths of these approaches, while addressing weaknesses in each of them. We formalize our approach as a model extension problem, which is based on the classical notion of extension of a structure by new relations. A parameterized version of this problem captures NP. We discuss properties of the formal framework intended to support effective modelling, and prospects for effective solver design.|David G.

One approach that effectively addresses the intractable memory requirements of POMDP algorithms is based on representing POMDP policies as finite-state controllers. In this paper, we illustrate some fundamental disadvantages of existing techniques that use controllers. We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques. The results open up promising research directions for solving large POMDPs using nonlinear programming methods.|Christopher Amato,Daniel S.

Finding such assignments is key to efficient search, but practical efforts have largely been limited to random guessing and heuristically designed weighting systems. In contrast, we derive a new version of Belief Propagation (BP) using the method of Expectation Maximization (EM). This allows us to differentiate between variables that are strongly biased toward particular values and those that are largely extraneous. Using EM also eliminates the threat of non-convergence associated with regular BP. Theoretically, the derivation exhibits appealing primaldual semantics. Empirically, it produces an \"EMBP\"-based heuristic for solving constraint satisfaction problems, as illustrated with respect to the Quasigroup with Holes domain.

In this paper, we propose a much simpler approach based on multiplicative updates. This idea was first explored in Cristianini et al., , but its convergence is sensitive to a learning rate that has to be fixed manually. Moreover, the update rule only works for the hard-margin SVM, which is known to have poor performance on noisy data. In this paper, we show that the multiplicative update of SVM can be formulated as a Bregman projection problem, and the learning rate can then be adapted automatically. Moreover, because of the connection between boosting and Bregman distance, we show that this multiplicative update for SVM can be regarded as boosting the (weighted) Parzen window classifiers. Motivated by the success of boosting, we then consider the use of an adaptive ensemble of the partially trained SVMs. Extensive experiments show that the proposed multiplicative update rule with an adaptive learning rate leads to faster and more stable convergence. Moreover, the proposed ensemble has efficient training and comparable or even better accuracy than the best-tuned soft-margin SVM.|Ivor W. Tsang,James T.

Recently, it is also used for multi-instance (MI) learning by employing a kernel that is defined directly on the bags. As only the bags (but not the instances) have known labels, this MI kernel implicitly assumes all instances in the bag to be equally important. However, a fundamental property of MI learning is that not all instances in a positive bag necessarily belong to the positive class, and thus different instances in the same bag should have different contributions to the kernel. In this paper, we address this instance label ambiguity by using the method of marginalized kernels. It first assumes that all the instance labels are available and defines a label-dependent kernel on the instances. By integrating out the unknown instance labels, a marginalized kernel defined on the bags can then be obtained. A desirable property is that this kernel weights the instance pairs by the consistencies of their probabilistic instance labels. Experiments on both classification and regression data sets show that this marginalized MI kernel, when used in a standard SVM, performs consistently better than the original MI kernel. It also outperforms a number of traditional MI learning methods.|James T.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design. Our contribution is the introduction of a general technique for designing SVM kernels tailored for the classification of sequence data.|Young-In Shin,Donald S.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs).

Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16080|IJCAI|2005|Planning with graded fluents and actions|This work can be seen as a first approach to a new planning model that takes into account the possibility to express actions and fluents with nonboolean values.

However, action specifications are often limited to avoid conflicts arising from preconditioneffect interactions. PDDL -- the planning domain definition language -- for example, implements the \"no moving targets\" rule, which means that no two actions can simultaneously make use of a value if one of the two is updating the value. This rule poses problems for resource allocation planning in which resource values are accessed in preconditions and effects. A simple example is construction actions that consume certain amounts of a resource. For speeding up plan execution, we would like to be able to dispatch several construction actions simultaneously. Because action preconditions depend on resource values and action effects change them, the \"no moving targets\" rule does not allow concurrent execution. However, if sufficient resources are available, executing actions simultaneously poses no problems. This paper addresses the problem of deciding whether a set of actions produced by a planning system can be executed concurrently in the presence of fluent variables that occur in both action preconditions and effects. We first motivate the concurrent action execution problem by introducing a fair action scheduling algorithm for real-time strategy (RTS) games. Then we prove that the general decision problem, when restricting effects and preconditions to polynomial time computations, is co-NP complete. Thereafter, we focus on problem restrictions based on commutative operators which allow us to specify sufficient conditions for concurrent executability that can be checked quickly if the number of shared fluents is small.

So far much of the research has been focused on English due to the lack of semantically annotated resources in other languages. In this paper, we report first results on semantic role labeling using a pre-release version of the Chinese Proposition Bank. Since the Chinese Proposition Bank is superimposed on top of the Chinese Tree-bank, i.e., the semantic role labels are assigned to constituents in a treebank parse tree, we start by reporting results on experiments using the handcrafted parses in the treebank. This will give us a measure of the extent to which the semantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation in the treebank. We will then report experiments using a fully automatic Chinese parser that integrates word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing. This will gauge how successful semantic role labeling can be done for Chinese in realistic situations. We show that our results using hand-crafted parses are slightly higher than the results reported for the state-of-the-art semantic role labeling systems for English using the Penn English Proposition Bank data, even though the Chinese Proposition Bank is smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our system is much lower than the English state-of-the-art.

As an input the planners take a domain description D in action language AL which allows state constraints (non-stratified axioms), together with a set of CNF formulae describing the initial state, and a set of literals representing the goal. We propose two approximations of the transition diagram T defined by D. Both approximations are deterministic transition functions and can be computed efficiently. Moreover they are sound (and sometimes complete) with respect to T. In its search for a plan, an approximation based planner analyses paths of an approximation instead of that of T. CPApc and CPAph are forward, best first search planners based on this idea. We compare them with two state-of-the-art conformant planners, KACMBP and Conformant-FF (CFF), over benchmarks in the literature, and over two new domains. One has large number of state constraints and another has a high degree of incompleteness. Our planners perform reasonably well in benchmark domains and outperform KACMBP and CFF in the first domain while still working well with the second one. Our experimental result shows that having an integral part of a conformant planner to deal with state constraints directly can significantly improve its performance extending a similar claim for classical planners in (Thiebaux.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","65596|AAAI|2005|A Graph Theoretical Foundation for Integrating RDF Ontologies|RDF ontologies are rapidly increasing in number.

This allows us to differentiate between variables that are strongly biased toward particular values and those that are largely extraneous. Using EM also eliminates the threat of non-convergence associated with regular BP. Theoretically, the derivation exhibits appealing primaldual semantics.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","65528|AAAI|2005|SenseRelate  TargetWord-A Generalized Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation|Many words in natural language have different meanings when used in different contexts.

We present a sound and complete proof system with respect to our BDI-model and explore how symbolic model checking techniques can be applied to model checking BDI-agents. In order to make our BDI-model more flexible and practically realistic, we generalize it so that agents can have multiple sources of beliefs, goals and intentions.|Kaile Su,Abdul Sattar,Kewen Wang,Xiangyu Luo,Guido Governatori,Vineet Padmanabhan","16261|IJCAI|2005|Using Predictive Representations to Improve Generalization in Reinforcement Learning|The predictive representations hypothesis holds that particularly good generalization will result from representing the state of the world in terms of predictions about possible future experience.

It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood. This study indicate that, in comparison to the traditional Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA), PSOTA offers significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization in data modeled by the Poisson distribution, such as serial analysis of gene expression data.|Haiying Wang,Huiru Zheng,Francisco Azuaje","65433|AAAI|2005|Extending Continuous Time Bayesian Networks|Continuous-time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) (Nodelman, Shelton, & Koller  ), are an elegant modeling language for structured stochastic processes that evolve over continuous time.

In this paper, we present two extensions to the framework that make it more useful in modeling practical applications. The first extension models arbitrary transition time distributions using Erlang-Coxian approximations, while maintaining tractable learning. We show how the censored data problem arises in learning the distribution, and present a solution based on expectation-maximization initialized by the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The second extension is a general method for reasoning about negative evidence, by introducing updates that assert no observable events occur over an interval of time. Such updates were not defined in the original CTBN framework, and we show that their inclusion can significantly improve the accuracy of filtering and prediction.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","66069|AAAI|2007|Active Imitation Learning|Imitation learning, also called learning by watching or programming by demonstration, has emerged as a means of accelerating many reinforcement learning tasks.

For example, to train pattern classification models for a network intrusion detection task, experts need to analyze network events and assign them labels. This can be a very costly procedure if the instances to be labeled are selected at random. In the meantime, the loss associated with mislabeling an intrusion is much higher than the loss associated with the opposite error (i.e., labeling a legal event as being an intrusion).

This has rendered statistical software testing and machine learning techniques increasingly attractive. Drawing from both of these, we present an active learning framework for blackbox software testing. The active learning approach samples inputoutput pairs from a blackbox and learns a model of the system's behaviour. This model is then used to select new inputs for sampling. This framework has been developed in the context of commercial video games, complex virtual worlds with high-dimensional state spaces, too large for exhaustive testing. Beyond its correctness, developers need to evaluate the gameplay of a game, properties such as difficulty. We use the learned model not only to guide sampling but also to summarize the game's behaviour for the developer to evaluate. We present results from our semi-automated gameplay analysis by machine learning (SAGA-ML) tool applied to Electronics Arts' FIFA Soccer game.|Gang Xiao,Finnegan Southey,Robert C. Holte,Dana F.

We present a novel algorithm for finite domain constraint optimization that generalizes branch-and-bound search by reasoning about sets of assignments rather than individual assignments. Because in many practical cases, sets of assignments can be represented implicitly and compactly using symbolic techniques such as decision diagrams, the set-based algorithm can compute bounds faster than explicitly searching over individual assignments, while memory explosion can be avoided by limiting the size of the sets. Varying the size of the sets yields a family of algorithms that includes known search and inference algorithms as special cases.

This makes such systems particularly interesting because they can tolerate faults, and are able to cope with dynamic environments. We propose the first self stabilizing mechanism for multiagent combinatorial optimization, which works on general networks and stabilizes in a state corresponding to the optimal solution of the optimization problem. Our algorithm is based on dynamic programming, and requires a linear number of messages to find the optimal solution in the absence of faults. We show how our algorithm can be made super-stabilizing, in the sense that while transiting from one stable state to the next, our system preserves the assignments from the previous optimal state, until the new optimal solution is found. We offer equal bounds for the stabilization and the superstabilization time. Furthermore, we describe a general scheme for fault containment and fast response time upon low impact failures. Multiple, isolated failures are handled effectively. To show the merits of our approach we report on experiments with practically sized distributed meeting scheduling problems in a multiagent system.|Adrian Petcu,Boi Faltings","16230|IJCAI|2005|Networked Distributed POMDPs A Synergy of Distributed Constraint Optimization and POMDPs|In many real-world multiagent applications such as distributed sensor nets, a network of agents is formed based on each agent's limited interactions with a small number of neighbors.

Two basic classes of techniques to solve oversubscribed scheduling problems have emerged searching directly in the space of possible schedules and searching in an alternative space of task permutations (by relying on a schedule builder to provide a mapping to schedule space). In some problem contexts, permutation-based search methods have been shown to outperform schedule-space search methods, while in others the opposite has been shown to be the case. We consider two techniques for which this behavior has been observed TaskSwap (TS), a schedule-space repair search procedure, and Squeaky Wheel Optimization (SWO), a permutation-space scheduling procedure. We analyze the circumstances under which one can be expected to dominate the other. Starting from a real-world scheduling problem where SWO has been shown to outperform TS, we construct a series of problem instances that increasingly incorporate characteristics of a second real-world scheduling problem, where TS has been found to outperform SWO. Experimental results provide insights into when schedule-space methods and permutation-based methods may be most appropriate.|Laurence A. Kramer,Laura Barbulescu,Stephen F.

Using these data and the domain knowledge including known operation rules, we can generate an explanation for each behavior. Moreover, the application of hypothetical reasoning, which offers consistent selection of hypotheses, to the generation of explanations allows us to use otherwise incompatible operation rules as domain knowledge.

It proposes a model for predicting people's actions in multiple bilateral rounds of interactions. The model represents reciprocity as a tradeoff between two social factors the extent to which players reward and retaliate others' past actions (retrospective reasoning), and their estimate about the future ramifications of their actions (prospective reasoning). The model is trained and evaluated over a series of negotiation rounds that vary players' possible strategies as well as their benefit from potential strategies at each round. Results show that reasoning about reciprocal behavior significantly improves the predictive power of the model, enabling it to outperform alternative models that do not reason about reciprocity, or that play various game theoretic equilibria.

The semantic representations are used to automatically generate descriptions for each of the thousands of new data products. We interleave the creation of the workflow with its execution, which allows intermediate execution data products to influence the generation of the following portions of the workflow. We have implemented this approach in Wings, a workflow creation system that combines semantic representations with planning techniques. We have used Wings to create workflows of thousands of computations, which are submitted to the Pegasus mapping system for execution over distributed computing environments. We show results on an earthquake simulation workflow that was automatically created with a total number of , jobs and that executed for a total of .

However, selecting the best speed is also important - beyond its relationship to stopping distance and lateral maneuverability. Consider a high-speed ( mph) autonomous vehicle driving off-road through challenging desert terrain. The vehicle should drive slowly on terrain that poses substantial risk. However, it should not dawdle on safe terrain. In this paper we address one aspect of risk - shock to the vehicle. We present an algorithm for trading-off shock and speed in realtime and without human intervention. The trade-off is optimized using supervised learning to match human driving. The learning process is essential due to the discontinuous and spatially correlated nature of the control problem - classical techniques do not directly apply. We evaluate performance over hundreds of miles of autonomous driving, including performance during the  DARPA Grand Challenge. This approach was the deciding factor in our vehicle's speed for nearly % of the DARPA competition - more than any other constraint except the DARPA-imposed speed limits - and resulted in the fastest finishing time.|David Stavens,Gabriel Hoffmann,Sebastian Thrun","16306|IJCAI|2005|Optimized Execution of Action Chains Using Learned Performance Models of Abstract Actions|Many plan-based autonomous robot controllers generate chains of abstract actions in order to achieve complex, dynamically changing, and possibly interacting goals. The execution of these action chains often results in robot behavior that shows abrupt transitions between subsequent actions, causing suboptimal performance. The resulting motion patterns are so characteristic for robots that people imitating robotic behavior will do so by making abrupt movements between actions. In this paper we propose a novel computation model for the execution of abstract action chains. In this computation model a robot first learns situation-specific performance models of abstract actions. It then uses these models to automatically specialize the abstract actions for their execution in a given action chain. This specialization results in refined chains that are optimized for performance. As a side effect this behavior optimization also appears to produce action chains with seamless transitions between actions.|Freek Stulp,Michael Beetz","16474|IJCAI|2007|Kernel Carpentry for Online Regression Using Randomly Varying Coefficient Model|We present a Bayesian formulation of locally weighted learning (LWL) using the novel concept of a randomly varying coefficient model. Based on this, we propose a mechanism for multivariate non-linear regression using spatially localised linear models that learns completely independent of each other, uses only local information and adapts the local model complexity in a data driven fashion. We derive online updates for the model parameters based on variational Bayesian EM. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm against other state-of-the-art methods reveal the excellent, robust generalization performance beside surprisingly efficient time and space complexity properties. This paper, for the first time, brings together the computational efficiency and the adaptability of 'non-competitive' locally weighted learning schemes and the modelling guarantees of the Bayesian formulation.|Narayanan U. Edakunni,Stefan Schaal,Sethu Vijayakumar","16703|IJCAI|2007|Image Modeling Using Tree Structured Conditional Random Fields|In this paper we present a discriminative framework based on conditional random fields for stochastic modeling of images in a hierarchical fashion. The main advantage of the proposed framework is its ability to incorporate a rich set of interactions among the image sites. We achieve this by inducing a hierarchy of hidden variables over the given label field. The proposed tree like structure of our model eliminates the need for a huge parameter space and at the same time permits the use of exact and efficient inference procedures based on belief propagation. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it to two important computer vision tasks, namely image labeling and object detection. The model parameters are trained using the contrastive divergence algorithm. We report the performance on real world images and compare it with the existing approaches.|Pranjal Awasthi,Aakanksha Gagrani,Balaraman Ravindran"]]}}
