To provide a natural and satisfying formalization of these attitudes is a longstanding problem in the community of agent theory. Most of existing modal logic approaches are based on Kripke structures and have to face the so-called side-effect problem. This paper presents a new modal logic formalizing agents' pro attitudes, based on neighborhood models. There are three distinguishing features of this logic. Firstly, this logic naturally satisfies Bratman's requirements for agents' beliefs and pro attitudes, as well as some interesting properties that have not been discussed before. Secondly, we give a sound and complete axiom system for characterizing all the valid properties of beliefs and pro attitudes. We introduce for the first time the notion of linear neighborhood frame for obtaining the semantic model, and this brings a new member to the family of non-normal modal logics. Finally, we argue that the present logic satisfies an important requirement proposed from the viewpoint of computation, that is, computational grounding, which means that properties in this logic can be given an interpretation in terms of some concrete computational model. Indeed, the presented neighborhood frame can be naturally derived from probabilistic programming with utilities.|Kaile Su,Abdul Sattar,Han Lin,Mark Reynolds","66171|AAAI|2007|Authorial Idioms for Target Distributions in TTD-MDPs|In designing Markov Decision Processes (MDP), one must define the world, its dynamics, a set of actions, and a reward function. MDPs are often applied in situations where there is a clear choice of reward functions and in these cases significant care must be taken to construct a reward function that induces the desired behavior. In this paper, we consider an analogous design problem crafting a target distribution in Targeted Trajectory Distribution MDPs (TTD-MDPs). TTD-MDPs produce probabilistic policies that minimize divergence from a target distribution of trajectories from an underlying MDP. They are an extension of MDPs that provide variety of experience during repeated execution. Here, we present a brief overview of TTD-MDPs with approaches for constructing target distributions. Then we present a novel authorial idiom for creating target distributions using prototype trajectories. We evaluate these approaches on a drama manager for an interactive game.|David L.

Artificial intelligence uses modal logics most heavily to represent and reason about knowledge of agents about others' knowledge. This type of reasoning occurs in dialog, collaboration, and competition. In many applications it is also important to be able to reason about the probability of beliefs and events. In this paper we provide a formal system that represents probabilistic knowledge about probabilistic knowledge. We also present exact and approximate algorithms for reasoning about the truth value of queries that are encoded as probabilistic modal logic formulas. We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model. Then, we introduce an approximate method for applications in which we have very many or infinitely many states. Exact methods are impractical in these applications and we show that our method returns a close estimate efficiently.|Afsaneh Shirazi,Eyal Amir","66123|AAAI|2007|Continuous State POMDPs for Object Manipulation Tasks|My research focus is on using continuous state partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to perform object manipulation tasks using a robotic arm. During object manipulation, object dynamics can be extremely complex, non-linear and challenging to specify. To avoid modeling the full complexity of possible dynamics. I instead use a model which switches between a discrete number of simple dynamics models. By learning these models and extending Porta's continuous state POMDP framework (Porta et at. ) to incorporate this switching dynamics model, we hope to handle tasks that involve absolute and relative dynamics within a single framework. This dynamics model may be applicable not only to object manipulation tasks, but also to a number of other problems, such as robot navigation. By using an explicit model of uncertainty, I hope to create solutions to object manipulation tasks that more robustly handle the noisy sensory information received by physical robots.|Emma Brunskill","66222|AAAI|2007|Scaling Up Solving POMDPs through Value Based Clustering|Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide an appropriately rich model for agents operating under partial knowledge of the environment.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","65976|AAAI|2007|Optimal Multi-Agent Scheduling with Constraint Programming|We consider the problem of computing optimal schedules in multi-agent systems.

More specifically, we focus on multi-agent scheduling problems with time windows, hard and soft precedence relations, and a nonlinear objective function. We show how we can model and efficiently solve these problems with constraint programming technology. Elements of our proposed method include constraint-based reasoning, search strategies, problem decomposition, scheduling algorithms, and a linear programming relaxation.

In the case of anthrax attack, a delay of hours in making a right decision can lead to hundreds of lives lost. Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision. We present empirical evidence illustrating that the performance of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and timeliness is improved significantly by utilizing POMDPs.|Masoumeh T.

In this paper we propose a mean of performing automated Web service composition by exploiting semantic matchmaking between Web service parameters (i.e., outputs and inputs) to enable their connection and interaction. The key idea is that the matchmaking enables, at run time, finding semantic compatibilities among independently defined Web service descriptions. To this end, our approach extends existing methods in order to explain misconnections between Web services. From this we generate Web service compositions that realize the goal, satisfying and optimizing the semantic connections between Web services. Moreover a process of relaxing the hard constraints is introduced in case the composition process failed. Our system is implemented and interacting with Web services dedicated on a Telecom scenario.

We identify a useful category of queries for which our approach guarantees also completeness. Furthermore, this paper reports on the implementation of our approach in the ONTOSEARCH system and preliminary, but encouraging, benchmark results which compare ONTOSEARCH's response times on a number of queries with those of existing ontology reasoning systems.|Jeff Z.

Amongst these, a prominent one is automated Web Service Composition (WSC). One important issue in this context has been hardly addressed so far WSC requires dealing with background ontologies. The support for those is severely limited in current planning tools. We introduce a planning formalism that faithfully represents WSC. We show that, unsurprisingly, planning in such a formalism is very hard. We then identify an interesting special case that covers many relevant WSC scenarios, and where the semantics are simpler and easier to deal with. This opens the way to the development of effective support tools for WSC. Furthermore, we show that if one additionally limits the amount and form of outputs that can be generated, then the set of possible states becomes static, and can be modelled in terms of a standard notion of initial state uncertainty. For this, effective tools exist these can realize scalable WSC with powerful background ontologies. In an initial experiment, we show how scaling WSC instances are comfortably solved by a tool incorporating modern planning heuristics.|J√∂rg Hoffmann,Piergiorgio Bertoli,Marco Pistore","66205|AAAI|2007|Stochastic Optimization for Collision Selection in High Energy Physics|Artificial intelligence has begun to play a critical role in basic science research. In high energy physics, AI methods can aid precision measurements that elucidate the underlying structure of matter, such as measurements of the mass of the top quark. Top quarks can be produced only in collisions at high energy particle accelerators. Most collisions, however, do not produce top quarks and making precise measurements requires culling these collisions into a sample that is rich in collisions producing top quarks (signal) and spare in collisions producing other particles (background). Collision selection is typically performed with heuristics or supervised learning methods. However, such approaches are suboptimal because they assume that the selector with the highest classification accuracy will yield a mass measurement with the smallest statistical uncertainty. In practice, however, the mass measurement is more sensitive to some backgrounds than others. This paper presents a new approach that uses stochastic optimization techniques to directly search for selectors that minimize statistical uncertainty in the top quark mass measurement. Empirical results confirm that stochastically optimized selectors have much smaller uncertainty. This new approach contributes substantially to our knowledge of the top quark's mass, as the new selectors are currently in use selecting real collisions.|Shimon Whiteson,Daniel Whiteson","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world.

However, as we begin creating autonomous agents to operate in the rich environments of modern videogames and computer simulations, it becomes important to devise agent behaviors that display the visible attributes of intelligence, rather than simply performing optimally. Such visibly intelligent behavior is difficult to specify with rules or characterize in terms of quantifiable objective functions, but it is possible to utilize human intuitions to directly guide a learning system toward the desired sorts of behavior. Policy induction from human-generated examples is a promising approach to training such agents. In this paper, such a method is developed and tested using Lamarckian neuroevolution. Artificial neural networks are evolved to control autonomous agents in a strategy game. The evolution is guided by human-generated examples of play, and the system effectively learns the policies that were used by the player to generate the examples.

To this end, we present a novel, anytime algorithm for this task that is significantly faster than current solutions. Specifically, we empirically show that we are able to find solutions that are optimal in .% of the time taken by the state of the art dynamic programming algorithm (for  agents), using much less memory (O(n) instead of O(n) for n agents). Moreover, our algorithm is the first to be able to find solutions for more than  agents in reasonable time (less than  minutes for  agents, as opposed to around  months for the best previous solution).|Talal Rahwan,Sarvapali D.

It is fundamental to automatic tracking, planning, and control of real-world stochastic systems such as robots, programs, and autonomous agents. This paper presents a novel sampling-based filtering algorithm. Its expected error is smaller than sequential Monte Carlo sampling techniques given a fixed number of samples, as we prove and show empirically. It does so by sampling deterministic action sequences and then performing exact filtering on those sequences.

We introduce a method (\"ironing\") to transform an algorithm for online stochastic optimization into one that is incentive-compatible. Ironing achieves this by canceling decisions that violate a form of monotonicity. The approach is applied to the CONSENSUS algorithm and experimental results in a resource allocation domain show that not many decisions need to be canceled and that the overhead of ironing is manageable.|David C.

Many online solutions for this problem make use of simplifying assumptions, such as Gaussian noise models and linear system behaviour and also adopt a filtering strategy which may not use available information optimally. These assumptions allow near real-time inference, while also limiting accuracy and introducing the potential for ill-conditioning and divergence. We consider augmenting a particular real-time estimation method, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), with a more complex, but more highly accurate, inference technique based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. Conventional MCMC techniques applied to this problem can entail significant and time consuming computation to achieve convergence. To address this, we propose an intelligent bootstrapping process and the use of parallel, communicative chains of different temperatures, commonly referred to as parallel tempering. The combined approach is shown to provide substantial improvement in a realistic simulated mapping environment and when applied to a complex physical system involving a robotic platform moving in an office environment instrumented with a camera sensor network.|Dimitri Marinakis,David Meger,Ioannis M.

Knowing how much a user trusts a source can be very useful for aggregating, filtering, and ordering of information. Furthermore, if trust is used to support decision making, it is important to have an accurate estimate of trust when it is not directly available, as well as a measure of confidence in that estimate. This paper describes a new approach that gives an explicit probabilistic interpretation for confidence in social networks. We describe SUNNY, a new trust inference algorithm that uses a probabilistic sampling technique to estimate our confidence in the trust information from some designated sources. SUNNY computes an estimate of trust based on only those information sources with high confidence estimates. In our experiments, SUNNY produced more accurate trust estimates than the well known trust inference algorithm TIDALTRUST (Golbeck ), demonstrating its effectiveness.|Ugur Kuter,Jennifer Golbeck","66078|AAAI|2007|A Search via Approximate Factoring|We present a novel method for creating A* estimates for structured search problems originally described in Haghighi, DeNero, & Klein ().

Traditionally, information extraction proceeds by first segmenting each candidate record separately, and then merging records that refer to the same entities. While computationally efficient, this approach is suboptimal, because it ignores the fact that segmenting one candidate record can help to segment similar ones. For example, resolving a well-segmented field with a less-clear one can disambiguate the latter's boundaries. In this paper we propose a joint approach to information extraction, where segmentation of all records and entity resolution are performed together in a single integrated inference process. While a number of previous authors have taken steps in this direction (eg., Pasula et al. (), Wellner et al. ()), to our knowledge this is the first fully joint approach. In experiments on the CiteSeer and Cora citation matching datasets, joint inference improved accuracy, and our approach outperformed previous ones. Further, by using Markov logic and the existing algorithms for it, our solution consisted mainly of writing the appropriate logical formulas, and required much less engineering than previous ones.|Hoifung Poon,Pedro Domingos","66065|AAAI|2007|Semantic Inference at the Lexical-Syntactic Level|Semantic inference is an important component in many natural language understanding applications.

We propose a generic semantic inference framework that operates directly on syntactic trees. New trees are infened by applying entailment rules, which provide a unified representation for varying types of inferences. Rules were generated by manual and automatic methods, Covering generic linguistic structures as well as specific lexical-based inferences.

However, when continuous variables are present in Bayesian networks, their dependence relationships could be nonlinear and their probability distributions could be arbitrary. So far no efficient inference algorithm could deal with this case except Monte Carlo simulation methods such as Likelihood Weighting. But with unlikely evidence, simulation methods could be very slow to converge. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximate inference algorithm called Unscented Message Passing (UMP-BN) for Bayesian networks with arbitrary continuous variables. UMP-BN combines unscented transformation - a deterministic sampling method, and Pearl's message passing algorithm to provide the estimates of the first two moments of the posterior distributions. We test this algorithm with several networks including the ones with nonlinear andor non-Gaussian variables. The numerical experiments show that UMP-BN converges very fast and produces promising results.|Wei Sun,Kuo-Chu Chang"],["65985|AAAI|2007|A Modal Logic for Beliefs and Pro Attitudes|Agents' pro attitudes such as goals, intentions, desires, wishes, and judgements of satisfactoriness play an important role in how agents act rationally. To provide a natural and satisfying formalization of these attitudes is a longstanding problem in the community of agent theory. Most of existing modal logic approaches are based on Kripke structures and have to face the so-called side-effect problem. This paper presents a new modal logic formalizing agents' pro attitudes, based on neighborhood models. There are three distinguishing features of this logic. Firstly, this logic naturally satisfies Bratman's requirements for agents' beliefs and pro attitudes, as well as some interesting properties that have not been discussed before. Secondly, we give a sound and complete axiom system for characterizing all the valid properties of beliefs and pro attitudes. We introduce for the first time the notion of linear neighborhood frame for obtaining the semantic model, and this brings a new member to the family of non-normal modal logics. Finally, we argue that the present logic satisfies an important requirement proposed from the viewpoint of computation, that is, computational grounding, which means that properties in this logic can be given an interpretation in terms of some concrete computational model. Indeed, the presented neighborhood frame can be naturally derived from probabilistic programming with utilities.|Kaile Su,Abdul Sattar,Han Lin,Mark Reynolds","66179|AAAI|2007|Probabilistic Modal Logic|A modal logic is any logic for handling modalities concepts like possibility, necessity, and knowledge.

In this paper we provide a formal system that represents probabilistic knowledge about probabilistic knowledge. We also present exact and approximate algorithms for reasoning about the truth value of queries that are encoded as probabilistic modal logic formulas. We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model. Then, we introduce an approximate method for applications in which we have very many or infinitely many states. Exact methods are impractical in these applications and we show that our method returns a close estimate efficiently.|Afsaneh Shirazi,Eyal Amir","66056|AAAI|2007|Dynamic DFS Tree in ADOPT-ing|Several distributed constraint reasoning algorithms employ Depth First Search (DFS) trees on the constraint graph that spans involved agents.

This also allows for shorter DFS trees during the initial steps of the algorithms, while some constraints did not yet prove useful given visited combinations of assignments. Earlier distributed algorithms for finding spanning trees on agents did not look to maintain compatibility with an order already used. We also show that announcing a nogood to a single optional agent is bringing significant improvements in the total number of messages.

Using EM also eliminates the threat of non-convergence associated with regular BP. Theoretically, the derivation exhibits appealing primaldual semantics.

In the CSP framework, in addition to the naive individual filtering of XOR constraints used in SAT, we are able to apply a global domain filtering algorithm by viewing these constraints as a collection of linear equalities over the field of two elements. Our most promising strategy extends this approach further to larger domains, and applies the so-called generalized XOR constraints directly to CSP variables. This allows us to reap the benefits of the compact and structured representation that CSPs offer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our counting framework through experimental comparisons with the solution enumeration approach (which, we believe, is the current best generic solution counting method for CSPs), and with solution counting in the context of SAT and integer programming.|Carla P.

If the space of parameters is continuous, then we can regard it as a manifold. In practice, we usually do not know this manifold but we just have some representation of the data, often in a very high-dimensional feature space. Since the number of internal parameters does not change with the representation, the data will effectively lie on a low-dimensional submanifold in feature space. However, the data is usually corrupted by noise, which particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces makes it almost impossible to find the manifold structure. This paper reviews a method called Manifold Denoising, which projects the data onto the submanifold using a diffusion process on a graph generated by the data. We will demonstrate that the method is capable of dealing with non-trival high-dimensional noise.

We address the problem of how to deal with changes to a Description Logic knowledge base, when these changes affect only its ABox. We consider two types of changes namely update and erasure, and we characterize the semantics of these operations on the basis of the approaches proposed by Winslett and by Katsuno and Mendelzon. It is well known that, in general, Description Logics are not closed with respect to updates, in the sense that the set of models corresponding to an update applied to a knowledge base in a Description Logic L may not be expressible by ABoxes in L. We show that this is true also for erasure. To deal with this problem, we introduce the notion of best approximation of an update (erasure) in a DL L, with the goal of characterizing the L ABoxes that capture the update (erasure) at best. We then focus on DL-LiteF, a tractable Description Logic, and present polynomial algorithms for computing the best approximation of updates and erasures in this logic, which shows that the nice computational properties of DL-LiteF are retained in dealing with the evolution of the ABox.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Antonella Poggi,Riccardo Rosati","66198|AAAI|2007|Mapping and Revising Markov Logic Networks for Transfer Learning|Transfer learning addresses the problem of how to leverage knowledge acquired in a source domain to improve the accuracy and speed of learning in a related target domain.

In our work, we are challenged with efficiently generating and validating workflows that contain large amounts (hundreds to thousands) of individual computations to be executed over distributed environments. This paper describes a new approach to workflow creation that uses semantic representations to describe compactly complex scientific applications in a data-independent manner, then automatically generates workflows of computations for given data sets, and finally maps them to available computing resources. The semantic representations are used to automatically generate descriptions for each of the thousands of new data products. We interleave the creation of the workflow with its execution, which allows intermediate execution data products to influence the generation of the following portions of the workflow. We have implemented this approach in Wings, a workflow creation system that combines semantic representations with planning techniques. We have used Wings to create workflows of thousands of computations, which are submitted to the Pegasus mapping system for execution over distributed computing environments.

This work generally assumes that the size of the market (number of bidders) is known a priori, but that the mechanism designer has no knowledge of the distribution of bid values. However, in many real-world applications (such as online ticket sales), the opposite is true the seller has distributional knowledge of the bid values (e.g., via the history of past transactions in the market), but there is uncertainty about market size. Adopting the perspective of automated mechanism design, introduced by Conitzer and Sandholm, we develop algorithms that compute an optimal, or approximately optimal, online auction mechanism given access to this distributional knowledge. Our main results are twofold. First, we show that when the seller does not know the market size, no constant-approximation to the optimum efficiency or revenue is achievable in the worst case, even under the very strong assumption that bid values are i.i.d. samples from a distribution known to the seller. Second, we show that when the seller has distributional knowledge of the market size as well as the bid values, one can do well in several senses. Perhaps most interestingly, by combining dynamic programming with prophet inequalities (a technique from optimal stopping theory) we are able to design and analyze online mechanisms which are temporally strategyproof (even with respect to arrival and departure times) and approximately efficiency (revenue)-maximizing. In exploring the interplay between automated mechanism design and prophet inequalities, we prove new prophet inequalities motivated by the auction setting.|Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi,Robert D.

In practice, though, they may face barriers to this knowledge due to transaction costs or bounded rationality. Modeling and analyzing such settings has been the focus of much recent work, though a canonical model of such domains has not yet emerged. We begin by proposing a taxonomy of auction models with valuation uncertainty and showing how it categorizes previous work. We then restrict ourselves to single-good sealed-bid auctions, in which agents have (uncertain) independent private values and can introspect about their own (but not others') valuations through possibly costly and imperfect queries. We investigate second-price auctions, performing equilibrium analysis for cases with both discrete and continuous valuation distributions.

After analysis of more than , users for about two years, we reveal some interactions between social relations and readership relations. We first show that bloggers read other weblogs on a regular basis (% of weblogs that are read at least three times are read every five times a user logs in). We call this relation a regular reading relation (RR relation). Then, prediction of RR relations is done using features from the four kinds of social networks. Lastly, information diffusion on RR relations is analyzed and characterized. Results of this study show that the blogs in RR relations have an important role in bloggers' activities.

In this paper, we consider the problem of collaborative network discovery from domains such as intelligence analysis and litigation support where the analyst is attempting to construct a validated representation of the social network. We specifically address the challenge of relationship identification where the objective is to identify relevant communications that substantiate a given social relationship type. We propose a supervised ranking approach to the problem and assess its performance on a manager-subordinate relationship identification task using the Enron email corpus.

Actions have costs and can only be taken at discrete time steps (unlike the case with continuous control). Given an admissible heuristic function and a starting state, the objective is to find a minimum-cost plan that reaches a goal state. As the continuous domain does not allow the tight optimality results that are possible in the discrete case (for example by A*), we instead propose and analyze an approximate forward-search algorithm that has the following provable properties. Given a desired accuracy , and a bound d on the length of the plan, the algorithm computes a lower bound L on the cost of any plan. It either (a) returns a plan of cost L that is at most  more than the optimal plan, or (b) if, according to the heuristic estimate, there may exist a plan of cost L of length  d, returns a partial plan that traces the first d steps of such plan. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that provides optimality guarantees in continuous domains with discrete control and without uncertainty.|Samuel Ieong,Nicolas S.

These operators are then assessed for rationality against the traditional AGM postulates. There is a large volume of work concerned with classical beliefrevision, the primary issue of which is the mitigation of the uncertainty inherent in environments in which belief revision is necessary. Traditional approaches attempt to assess the explanatory power of beliefs and utilize this as a heuristic to resolve this ambiguity. We argue that for practical reasoning systems, whose primary focus lies in the maintenance of behavior and not information, an agent's intentions provide a better guide.|Timothy William Cleaver,Abdul Sattar","66205|AAAI|2007|Stochastic Optimization for Collision Selection in High Energy Physics|Artificial intelligence has begun to play a critical role in basic science research. In high energy physics, AI methods can aid precision measurements that elucidate the underlying structure of matter, such as measurements of the mass of the top quark. Top quarks can be produced only in collisions at high energy particle accelerators. Most collisions, however, do not produce top quarks and making precise measurements requires culling these collisions into a sample that is rich in collisions producing top quarks (signal) and spare in collisions producing other particles (background). Collision selection is typically performed with heuristics or supervised learning methods. However, such approaches are suboptimal because they assume that the selector with the highest classification accuracy will yield a mass measurement with the smallest statistical uncertainty. In practice, however, the mass measurement is more sensitive to some backgrounds than others. This paper presents a new approach that uses stochastic optimization techniques to directly search for selectors that minimize statistical uncertainty in the top quark mass measurement. Empirical results confirm that stochastically optimized selectors have much smaller uncertainty. This new approach contributes substantially to our knowledge of the top quark's mass, as the new selectors are currently in use selecting real collisions.|Shimon Whiteson,Daniel Whiteson","66086|AAAI|2007|Near-optimal Observation Selection using Submodular Functions|AI problems such as autonomous robotic exploration, automatic diagnosis and activity recognition have in common the need for choosing among a set of informative but possibly expensive observations. When monitoring spatial phenomena with sensor networks or mobile robots, for example, we need to decide which locations to observe in order to most effectively decrease the uncertainty, at minimum cost. These problems usually are NP-hard. Many observation selection objectives satisfy submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property - adding a sensor to a small deployment helps more than adding it to a large deployment. In this paper, we survey recent advances in systematically exploiting this submodularity property to efficiently achieve near-optimal observation selections, under complex constraints. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approaches on problems of monitoring environmental phenomena and water distribution networks.|Andreas Krause,Carlos Guestrin","66128|AAAI|2007|On the Partial Observability of Temporal Uncertainty|We explore a means to both model and reason about partial observability within the scope of constraint-based temporal reasoning. Prior studies of uncertainty in Temporal CSPs have required the realization of all exogenous processes to be made entirely visible to the agent. We relax this assumption and propose an extension to the Simple Temporal Problem with Uncertainty (STPU), one in which the executing agent is made aware of the occurrence of only a subset of uncontrollable events. We argue that such a formalism is needed to encode those complex environments whose external phenomena share a common, hidden source of temporal causality. After characterizing the levels of controllability in the resulting Partially Observable STPU and various special cases, we generalize a known family of reduction rules to account for this relaxation, introducing the properties of extended contingency and sufficient observability. We demonstrate that these modifications enable a polynomial filtering algorithm capable of determining a local form of dynamic controllability however, we also show that there do remain some instances whose global controllability cannot yet be correctly identified by existing inference rules, leaving the true computational complexity of dynamic controllability an open problem for future research.|Michael D.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","66061|AAAI|2007|Valuation Uncertainty and Imperfect Introspection in Second-Price Auctions|In auction theory, agents are typically presumed to have perfect knowledge of their valuations.

The performance of autonomous agents in these markets depends both upon the strategies of their opponents and on various market conditions, such as supply and demand. Because the space for possible strategies and market conditions is very large, empirical analysis in these domains becomes exceedingly difficult. Researchers who wish to evaluate their agents must run many test games across multiple opponent sets and market conditions to verify that agent performance has actually improved. Our approach is to improve the statistical power of market simulation experiments by controlling their complexity, thereby creating an environment more conducive to structured agent testing and analysis. We develop a tool that controls variability across games in one such market environment, the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM), and demonstrate how it provides an efficient, systematic method for TAC SCM researchers to analyze agent performance.|Eric Sodomka,John Collins,Maria L.

We go on to provide nearly matching lower bounds that are attained even by non-adversarially chosen solution sets induced by a simple stochastic model.|Hang T. Dinh,Alexander Russell,Yuan Su","65983|AAAI|2007|Active Algorithm Selection|Most previous studies on active learning focused on the problem of model selection, i.e., how to identify the optimal classification model from a family of predefined models using a small, carefully selected training set. In this paper, we address the problem of active algorithm selection. The goal of this problem is to efficiently identify the optimal learning algorithm for a given dataset from a set of algorithms using a small training set. In this study, we present a general framework for active algorithm selection by extending the idea of the Hedge algorithm. It employs the worst case analysis to identify the example that can effectively increase the weighted loss function defined in the Hedge algorithm. We further extend the framework by incorporating the correlation information among unlabeled examples to accurately estimate the change in the weighted loss function, and Maximum Entropy Discrimination to automatically determine the combination weights used by the Hedge algorithm. Our empirical study with the datasets of WCCI  performance prediction challenge shows promising performance of the proposed framework for active algorithm selection.|Feilong Chen,Rong Jin","66163|AAAI|2007|Computational Complexity of Weighted Threshold Games|Weighted threshold games are coalitional games in which each player has a weight (intuitively corresponding to its voting power), and a coalition is successful if the sum of its weights exceeds a given threshold. Key questions in coalitional games include finding coalitions that are stable (in the sense that no member of the coalition has any rational incentive to leave it), and finding a division of payoffs to coalition members (an imputation) that is fair. We investigate the computational complexity of such questions for weighted threshold games. We study the core, the least core, and the nucleolus, distinguishing those problems that are polynomial-time computable from those that are NP-hard, and providing pseudopolynomial and approximation algorithms for the NP-hard problems.|Edith Elkind,Leslie Ann Goldberg,Paul W. Goldberg,Michael Wooldridge","66014|AAAI|2007|Ungreedy Methods for Chinese Deterministic Dependency Parsing|Deterministic dependency parsing has often been regarded as an efficient parsing algorithm while its parsing accuracy is a little lower than the best results reported by more complex parsing models. In this paper, we compare deterministic dependency parsers with complex parsing methods such as generative and discriminative parsers on the standard data set of Penn Chinese Treebank. The results show that, for Chinese dependency parsing, deterministic parsers outperform generative and discriminative parsers. Furthermore, based on the observation that deterministic parsing algorithms are greedy algorithms which choose the most probable parsing action at every step, we propose three kinds of ungreedy deterministic dependency parsing algorithms to globally model parsing actions. Results show that ungreedy deterministic dependency parsers perform better than original deterministic dependency parsers while maintaining the same time complexity, and our best parser improves much over all other parsers.|Xiangyu Duan,Jun Zhao,Bo Xu","66255|AAAI|2007|Extracting Influential Nodes for Information Diffusion on a Social Network|We consider the combinatorial optimization problem of finding the most influential nodes on a large-scale social network for two widely-used fundamental stochastic diffusion models. It was shown that a natural greedy strategy can give a good approximate solution to this optimization problem. However, a conventional method under the greedy algorithm needs a large amount of computation, since it estimates the marginal gains for the expected number of nodes influenced by a set of nodes by simulating the random process of each model many times. In this paper, we propose a method of efficiently estimating all those quantities on the basis of bond percolation and graph theory, and apply it to approximately solving the optimization problem under the greedy algorithm. Using real-world large-scale networks including blog networks, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the conventional method, and achieve a large reduction in computational cost.|Masahiro Kimura,Kazumi Saito,Ryohei Nakano","65957|AAAI|2007|Computing Pure Nash Equilibria in Symmetric Action Graph Games|We analyze the problem of computing pure Nash equilibria in action graph games (AGGs), which are a compact game-theoretic representation. While the problem is NP-complete in general, for certain classes of AGGs there exist polynomial time algorithms. We propose a dynamic-programming approach that constructs equilibria of the game from equilibria of restricted games played on subgraphs of the action graph. In particular, if the game is symmetric and the action graph has bounded treewidth, our algorithm determines the existence of pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time.|Albert Xin Jiang,Kevin Leyton-Brown","66143|AAAI|2007|RETALIATE Learning Winning Policies in First-Person Shooter Games|In this paper we present RETALIATE, an online reinforcement learning algorithm for developing winning policies in team first-person shooter games. RETALIATE has three crucial characteristics () individual BOT behavior is fixed although not known in advance, therefore individual BOTS work as \"plugins\", () RETALIATE models the problem of learning team tactics through a simple state formulation, () discount rates commonly used in Q-Iearning are not used. As a result of these characteristics, the application of the Q-learning algorithm results in the rapid exploration towards a winning policy against an opponent team. In our empirical evaluation we demonstrate that RETALIATE adapts well when the environment changes.|Megan Smith,Stephen Lee-Urban,Hector Mu√±oz-Avila","66218|AAAI|2007|Automatic Synthesis of a Global Behavior from Multiple Distributed Behaviors|We consider the problem of synthesizing a team of local behavior controllers to realize a fully controllable target behavior from a set of available partially controllable behaviors that execute distributively within a shared partially predictable, but fully observable, environment. Available behaviors stand for existing distributed components and are represented with (finite) nondeterministic transition systems. The target behavior is assumed to be fully deterministic and stands for the collective behavior that the system as a whole needs to guarantee. We formally define the problem within a general framework, characterize its computational complexity, and propose techniques to actually generate a solution. Also, we investigate the relationship between the distributed solutions and the centralized ones, in which a single global controller is conceivable.|Sebastian Sardi√±a,Fabio Patrizi,Giuseppe De Giacomo","66212|AAAI|2007|Anytime Coordination Using Separable Bilinear Programs|Developing scalable coordination algorithms for multi-agent systems is a hard computational challenge. One useful approach, demonstrated by the Coverage Set Algorithm (CSA), exploits structured interaction to produce significant computational gains. Empirically, CSA exhibits very good anytime performance, but an error bound on the results has not been established. We reformulate the algorithm and derive both online and offline error bounds for approximate solutions. Moreover, we propose an effective way to automatically reduce the complexity of the interaction. Our experiments show that this is a promising approach to solve a broad class of decentralized decision problems. The general formulation used by the algorithm makes it both easy to implement and widely applicable to a variety of other AI problems.|Marek Petrik,Shlomo Zilberstein","66149|AAAI|2007|Reacting to Agreement and Error in Spoken Dialogue Systems Using Degrees of Groundedness|Computational models of grounding are extended to include representations of degrees of groundedness.
