Such agents will need to be able to learn, both in order to correct and circumvent their inevitable imperfections, and to keep up with a dynamically changing world. They will also need to be able to interact with one another, whether they share common goals, they pursue independent goals, or their goals are in direct conflict. This paper presents current research directions in machine learning, multiagent reasoning, and robotics, and advocates their unification within concrete application domains. Ideally, new theoretical results in each separate area will inform practical implementations while innovations from concrete multiagent applications will drive new theoretical pursuits, and together these synergistic research approaches will lead us towards the goal of fully autonomous agents.|Peter Stone","16534|IJCAI|2007|An Efficient Protocol for Negotiation over Multiple Indivisible Resources|We study the problem of autonomous agents negotiating the allocation of multiple indivisible resources. It is difficult to reach optimal outcomes in bilateral or multi-lateral negotiations over multiple resources when the agents' preferences for the resources are not common knowledge. Self-interested agents often end up negotiating inefficient agreements in such situations. We present a protocol for negotiation over multiple indivisible resources which can be used by rational agents to reach efficient outcomes. Our proposed protocol enables the negotiating agents to identify efficient solutions using systematic distributed search that visits only a subspace of the whole solution space.|Sabyasachi Saha,Sandip Sen","16069|IJCAI|2005|Fast convergence to satisfying distributions|We investigate an environment where self-interested agents have to find high-quality service resources. Agents have common knowledge about resources which are able to provide these services. The performance of resources is measured by the satisfaction obtained by agents using them. The performance of a resource depends on its intrinsic capability and its current load. We use a satisfying rather than an optimizing framework, where agents are content to receive service quality above a threshold. We introduce a formal framework to characterize the convergence of agents to a state where each agent is satisfied with the performance of the service it is currently using. We analyzed the convergence behavior of such a system and identified a mechanism to speed up convergence.|Teddy Candale,Sandip Sen","16505|IJCAI|2007|Market Based Resource Allocation with Incomplete Information|Although there are some research efforts toward resource allocation in multi-agent systems (MAS), most of these work assume that each agent has complete information about other agents. This research investigates interactions among selfish, rational, and autonomous agents in resource allocation, each with incomplete information about other entities, and each seeking to maximize its expected utility. This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","16637|IJCAI|2007|An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Memory Bounds in a Distributed Resource Allocation Mechanism|Multiagent distributed resource allocation requires that agents act on limited, localized information with minimum communication overhead in order to optimize the distribution of available resources. When requirements and constraints are dynamic, learning agents may be needed to allow for adaptation. One way of accomplishing learning is to observe past outcomes, using such information to improve future decisions. When limits in agents' memory or observation capabilities are assumed, one must decide on how large should the observation window be. We investigate how this decision influences both agents' and system's performance in the context of a special class of distributed resource allocation problems, namely dispersion games. We show by numerical experiments over a specific dispersion game (the Minority Game) that in such scenario an agent's performance is non-monotonically correlated with her memory size when all other agents are kept unchanged. We then provide an information-theoretic explanation for the observed behaviors, showing that a downward causation effect takes place.|Ricardo M. Araujo,Luís C.

VCG mechanisms have received wide attention in the AI community because they are efficient and strategy-proof a special case of the Groves family of mechanisms, VCG mechanisms are the only direct-revelation mechanisms that are allocatively efficient and strategy-proof. Unfortunately, they are only weakly budget-balanced. We consider self-interested agents in a network flow domain, and show that in this domain, it is possible to design a mechanism that is both allocatively-efficient and almost completely budget-balanced. This is done by choosing a mechanism that is not strategy-proof but rather strategy-resistant. Instead of using the VCG mechanism, we propose a mechanism in which finding a beneficial manipulation is an NP-complete problem, and the payments from the agents to the mechanism may be minimized as much as desired.|Yoram Bachrach,Jeffrey S.

For that aim we introduce HADES, a self-regenerating cooperative multi-agent system with local monitoring. When agents of HADES find local failures they repair them. However, in extreme cases repair may not be possible and irregular aggressive agents will multiply. These irregular agents may use all of the system's resources and thus take over the system. To optimize system longevity, we identify protocols for killing these irregular agents. Our primary contribution is a double communication protocol of alert and death signals among the agents, making the multi-agent system robust to failures and attacks.|Megan Olsen,Hava T.

It has been shown in the literature that the point of convergence and motion of a swarm of autonomous mobile agents can be controlled by using cyclic pursuit laws. In cyclic pursuit, there exists a predefined cyclic connection between agents and each agent pursues the next agent in the cycle. In this paper we generalize this idea to a case where an agent pursues a point which is the weighted average of the positions of the remaining agents. This point correspond to a particular pursuit sequence. Using this concept of centroidal cyclic pursuit, the behavior of the agents is analyzed such that, by suitably selecting the agents' gain, the rendezvous point of the agents can be controlled, directed linear motion of the agents can be achieved, and the trajectories of the agents can be changed by switching between the pursuit sequences keeping some of the behaviors of the agents invariant. Simulation experiments are given to support the analytical proofs.|Arpita Sinha,Debasish Ghose","16375|IJCAI|2007|Reaching Envy-Free States in Distributed Negotiation Settings|Mechanisms for dividing a set of goods amongst a number of autonomous agents need to balance efficiency and fairness requirements.

A new type of agents, called semicooperative (SC) agents is proposed for this environment. When these agents negotiate with each other they reach a pareto-optimal solution that is mutually beneficial. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the superiority of providing such agents for humans over supplying equilibrium agents or letting people design their own agents. These results are based on our observation that most people do not modify SC agents even though they are not in equilibrium. Our findings introduce a new factor -human response to provided agents - that should be taken into consideration when developing agents that are provided to a population.|Efrat Manisterski,Ron Katz,Sarit Kraus"],["16533|IJCAI|2007|Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning|Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is the problem of learning the reward function underlying a Markov Decision Process given the dynamics of the system and the behaviour of an expert.

In this paper we show how to combine prior knowledge and evidence from the expert's actions to derive a probability distribution over the space of reward functions. We present efficient algorithms that find solutions for the reward learning and apprenticeship learning tasks that generalize well over these distributions.

However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction. Simple examples are given in order to show the advantages of the algorithm.|Marc G.

However, not all partially observable Markov decision processes can be efficiently learned with TD networks. In this paper, we extend TD networks by allowing the network-update process (answer network) to depend on the recent history of previous actions and observations rather than only on the most recent action and observation. We show that this extension enables the solution of a larger class of problems than can be solved by the original TD networks or by history-based methods alone. In addition, we apply TD networks to a problem that, while still simple, is significantly larger than has previously been considered. We show that history-extended TD networks can learn much of the common-sense knowledge of an egocentric gridworld domain with a single bit of perception.|Brian Tanner,Richard S.

Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","16658|IJCAI|2007|AEMS An Anytime Online Search Algorithm for Approximate Policy Refinement in Large POMDPs|Solving large Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) is a complex task which is often intractable. A lot of effort has been made to develop approximate offline algorithms to solve ever larger POMDPs. However, even state-of-the-art approaches fail to solve large POMDPs in reasonable time. Recent developments in online POMDP search suggest that combining offline computations with online computations is often more efficient and can also considerably reduce the error made by approximate policies computed offline. In the same vein, we propose a new anytime online search algorithm which seeks to minimize, as efficiently as possible, the error made by an approximate value function computed offline. In addition, we show how previous online computations can be reused in following time steps in order to prevent redundant computations. Our preliminary results indicate that our approach is able to tackle large state space and observation space efficiently and under real-time constraints.|Stéphane Ross,Brahim Chaib-draa","16446|IJCAI|2007|The Value of Observation for Monitoring Dynamic Systems|We consider the fundamental problem of monitoring (i.e. tracking) the belief state in a dynamic system, when the model is only approximately correct and when the initial belief state might be unknown. In this general setting where the model is (perhaps only slightly) mis-specified, monitoring (and consequently planning) may be impossible as errors might accumulate over time. We provide a new characterization, the value of observation, which allows us to bound the error accumulation. The value of observation is a parameter that governs how much information the observation provides. For instance, in Partially Observable MDPs when it is  the POMDP is an MDP while for an unobservable Markov Decision Process the parameter is . Thus, the new parameter characterizes a spectrum from MDPs to unobservable MDPs depending on the amount of information conveyed in the observations.|Eyal Even-Dar,Sham M.

Our experiments verify the theoretical guarantees, and show that we learn STRIPS actions efficiently, with time that is significantly better than approaches for HMMs and Reinforcement Learning (which are inexact).

One approach that effectively addresses the intractable memory requirements of POMDP algorithms is based on representing POMDP policies as finite-state controllers. In this paper, we illustrate some fundamental disadvantages of existing techniques that use controllers. We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques.

Although much effort has been made to design efficient standalone AC algorithms, there is no systematic study on how to efficiently enforce AC during search, as far as we know. The significance of the latter is clear given the fact that AC will be enforced millions of times in solving hard problems. In this paper, we propose a framework for enforcing AC during search (ACS) and complexity measurements of ACS algorithms. Based on this framework, several ACS algorithms are designed to take advantage of the residual data left in the data structures by the previous invocation(s) of ACS.

The backtrack algorithms that maintain some local consistency during search have become the de facto standard to solve CSPs. Maintaining higher levels of consistency, generally, reduces the search effort. However, due to ineffective constraint propagation, it often penalises the search algorithm in terms of time. If we can reduce ineffective constraint propagation, then the effectiveness of a search algorithm can be enhanced significantly. In order to do so, we use a probabilistic approach to resolve when to propagate and when not to. The idea is to perform only the useful consistency checking by not seeking a support when there is a high probability that a support exists. The idea of probabilistic support inference is general and can be applied to any kind of local consistency algorithm. However, we shall study its impact with respect to arc consistency and singleton arc consistency (SAC). Experimental results demonstrate that enforcing probabilistic SAC almost always enforces SAC, but it requires significantly less time than SAC.

Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16334|IJCAI|2005|Automatic Semantic Role Labeling for Chinese Verbs|Recent years have seen a revived interest in semantic parsing by applying statistical and machine-learning methods to semantically annotated corpora such as the FrameNet and the Proposition Bank. So far much of the research has been focused on English due to the lack of semantically annotated resources in other languages. In this paper, we report first results on semantic role labeling using a pre-release version of the Chinese Proposition Bank. Since the Chinese Proposition Bank is superimposed on top of the Chinese Tree-bank, i.e., the semantic role labels are assigned to constituents in a treebank parse tree, we start by reporting results on experiments using the handcrafted parses in the treebank. This will give us a measure of the extent to which the semantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation in the treebank. We will then report experiments using a fully automatic Chinese parser that integrates word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing. This will gauge how successful semantic role labeling can be done for Chinese in realistic situations. We show that our results using hand-crafted parses are slightly higher than the results reported for the state-of-the-art semantic role labeling systems for English using the Penn English Proposition Bank data, even though the Chinese Proposition Bank is smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our system is much lower than the English state-of-the-art. This reveals an interesting cross-linguistic difference between the two languages, which we attempt to explain.

Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions.

Given the pattern V -NP-P-NP in the text, where V is verb, NP is a noun phrase, P is the preposition and NP is the other noun phrase, the question asked is where does P - NP attach V or NP This question is typically answered using both the word and the world knowledge. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution. Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach. The unambiguous V - P - N and N - P -N tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N - P - N tuples of the test corpus.

It is critical for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), and Machine Translation (MT). Since the meaning and usage of a word can vary in distinct contexts, different paraphrases should be acquired according to the contexts. However, most of the existing researches focus on constructing paraphrase corpora, in which little contextual constraints for paraphrase application are imposed. This paper presents a method that automatically acquires context-specific lexical paraphrases. In this method, the obtained paraphrases of a word depend on the specific sentence the word occurs in. Two stages are included, i.e. candidate paraphrase extraction and paraphrase validation, both of which are mainly based on web mining. Evaluations are conducted on a news title corpus and the presented method is compared with a paraphrasing method that exploits a Chinese thesaurus of synonyms -- Tongyi Cilin (Extended) (CilinE for short). Results show that the f-measure of our method (.) is significantly higher than that using CilinE (.). In addition, over % of the correct paraphrases derived by our method cannot be found in CilinE, which suggests that our method is effective in acquiring out-of-thesaurus paraphrases.|Shiqi Zhao,Ting Liu,Xincheng Yuan,Sheng Li,Yu Zhang"],["16030|IJCAI|2005|Language Learning in Multi-Agent Systems|We present the problem of learning to communicate in decentralized and stochastic environments, analyzing it formally in a decision-theoretic context and illustrating the concept experimentally.

A classic result implies that implementation in dominant strategies is impossible in this model. We first show that a relaxation to Bayes-Nash implementation does not circumvent the problem. We then propose a class of partial revelation mechanisms that achieve approximate dominant strategy implementation, and describe a computationally tractable algorithm for myopically optimizing the partitioning of each agent's type space to reduce manipulability and social welfare loss. This allows for the automated design of one-shot partial revelation mechanisms with worst-case guarantees on both manipulability and efficiency.|Nathanael Hyafil,Craig Boutilier","16450|IJCAI|2007|Using Focal Point Learning to Improve Tactic Coordination in Human-Machine Interactions|We consider an automated agent that needs to coordinate with a human partner when communication between them is not possible or is undesirable (tactic coordination games).

Nevertheless, humans are often able to coordinate with one another in communication-free games, by using focal points, \"prominent\" solutions to coordination problems.

The vast majority of this work has assumed that negotiation issues are independent, so agents can aggregate the utilities of the issue values by simple summation, producing linear utility functions. In the real world, however, such aggregations are often unrealistic. We cannot, for example, just add up the value of car's carburetor and the value of car's engine when engineers negotiate over the design a car. These value of these choices are interdependent, resulting in nonlinear utility functions. In this paper, we address this important gap in current negotiation techniques. We propose a negotiation protocol where agents employ adjusted sampling to generate proposals, and a bidding-based mechanism is used to find social-welfare maximizing deals.

This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","16391|IJCAI|2007|Near-Optimal Anytime Coalition Structure Generation|Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems.

Coarse-grained arc consistency algorithms like AC-, AC-d and AC- are efficient when it comes to transforming a CSP to its arc-consistent equivalent. These algorithms repeatedly carry out revisions. Revisions require support checks for identifying and deleting all unsupported values from the domain of a variable. In revisions for difficult problems most values have some support. Indeed, most revisions are ineffective, i.e. they cannot delete any value and consume a lot of checks and time. We propose two solutions to overcome these problems. First we introduce the notion of a Support Condition (SC) which guarantees that a value has some support. SCs reduce support checks while maintaining arc consistency during search. Second we introduce the notion of a Revision Condition (RC) which guarantees that all values have support. A RC avoids a candidate revision and queue maintenance overhead. For random problems, SCs reduce the checks required by MAC- (MAC-) up to % (%). RCs avoid at least % of the total revisions.

The significance of the latter is clear given the fact that AC will be enforced millions of times in solving hard problems. In this paper, we propose a framework for enforcing AC during search (ACS) and complexity measurements of ACS algorithms. Based on this framework, several ACS algorithms are designed to take advantage of the residual data left in the data structures by the previous invocation(s) of ACS.

The backtrack algorithms that maintain some local consistency during search have become the de facto standard to solve CSPs. Maintaining higher levels of consistency, generally, reduces the search effort. However, due to ineffective constraint propagation, it often penalises the search algorithm in terms of time. If we can reduce ineffective constraint propagation, then the effectiveness of a search algorithm can be enhanced significantly. In order to do so, we use a probabilistic approach to resolve when to propagate and when not to. The idea is to perform only the useful consistency checking by not seeking a support when there is a high probability that a support exists. The idea of probabilistic support inference is general and can be applied to any kind of local consistency algorithm. However, we shall study its impact with respect to arc consistency and singleton arc consistency (SAC). Experimental results demonstrate that enforcing probabilistic SAC almost always enforces SAC, but it requires significantly less time than SAC. Likewise, maintaining probabilistic arc consistency and maintaining probabilistic SAC require significantly less time than maintaining arc consistency and maintaining SAC.|Deepak Mehta,Marc R.

So far much of the research has been focused on English due to the lack of semantically annotated resources in other languages. In this paper, we report first results on semantic role labeling using a pre-release version of the Chinese Proposition Bank. Since the Chinese Proposition Bank is superimposed on top of the Chinese Tree-bank, i.e., the semantic role labels are assigned to constituents in a treebank parse tree, we start by reporting results on experiments using the handcrafted parses in the treebank. This will give us a measure of the extent to which the semantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation in the treebank. We will then report experiments using a fully automatic Chinese parser that integrates word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing. This will gauge how successful semantic role labeling can be done for Chinese in realistic situations. We show that our results using hand-crafted parses are slightly higher than the results reported for the state-of-the-art semantic role labeling systems for English using the Penn English Proposition Bank data, even though the Chinese Proposition Bank is smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our system is much lower than the English state-of-the-art.

Therefore, reasoning techniques developed for RCC and RA can be used to solve the satisfiability problem of a joint network.|Sanjiang Li","16515|IJCAI|2007|A Scalable Kernel-Based Algorithm for Semi-Supervised Metric Learning|In recent years, metric learning in the semisupervised setting has aroused a lot of research interests. One type of semi-supervised metric learning utilizes supervisory information in the form of pairwise similarity or dissimilarity constraints. However, most methods proposed so far are either limited to linear metric learning or unable to scale up well with the data set size. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear metric learning method based on the kernel approach. By applying low-rank approximation to the kernel matrix, our method can handle significantly larger data sets. Moreover, our low-rank approximation scheme can naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. Experiments performed on both artificial and real-world data show very promising results.|Dit-Yan Yeung,Hong Chang,Guang Dai","16768|IJCAI|2007|Conditional Constraint Satisfaction Logical Foundations and Complexity|Conditional Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CCSPs) are generalizations of classical CSPs that support conditional activation of variables and constraints.

Because in many practical cases, sets of assignments can be represented implicitly and compactly using symbolic techniques such as decision diagrams, the set-based algorithm can compute bounds faster than explicitly searching over individual assignments, while memory explosion can be avoided by limiting the size of the sets.

In this paper we provide a technique for accomplishing this objective. Our technique can deal with a rich class of preferences, including so-called temporally extended preferences (TEPs). Unlike simple preferences which express desired properties of the final state achieved by a plan, TEPs can express desired properties of the entire sequence of states traversed by a plan, allowing the user to express a much richer set of preferences. Our technique involves converting a planning problem with TEPs into an equivalent planning problem containing only simple preferences. This conversion is accomplished by augmenting the inputed planning domain with a new set of predicates and actions for updating these predicates. We then provide a collection of new heuristics and a specialized search algorithm that can guide the planner towards preferred plans. Under some fairly general conditions our method is able to find a most preferred plan-i.e., an optimal plan. It can accomplish this without having to resort to admissible heuristics, which often perform poorly in practice. Nor does our technique require an assumption of restricted plan length or make-span. We have implemented our approach in the HPlan-P planning system and used it to compete in the th International Planning Competition, where it achieved distinguished performance in the Qualitative Preferences track.|Jorge A.

Assuming a graphical utility model, we describe several elicitation strategies that require the user to answer only binary (bound) queries on the utility model parameters. While a theoretically motivated algorithm can provably reduce regret quickly (in terms of number of queries), we demonstrate that, in practice, heuristic strategies perform much better, and are able to find optimal (or near-optimal) configurations with far fewer queries.|Craig Boutilier,Relu Patrascu,Pascal Poupart,Dale Schuurmans","16248|IJCAI|2005|Algebraic Markov Decision Processes|In this paper, we provide an algebraic approach to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which allows a unified treatment of MDPs and includes many existing models (quantitative or qualitative) as particular cases.

In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal.

These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.|Janusz Marecki,Sven Koenig,Milind Tambe","16759|IJCAI|2007|Using Linear Programming for Bayesian Exploration in Markov Decision Processes|A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge.

In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming.

Meanwhile, virtually all these problems require classifiers that minimize a nonuniform loss function associated with the classification decisions (rather than the accuracy or number of errors). For example, to train pattern classification models for a network intrusion detection task, experts need to analyze network events and assign them labels. This can be a very costly procedure if the instances to be labeled are selected at random. In the meantime, the loss associated with mislabeling an intrusion is much higher than the loss associated with the opposite error (i.e., labeling a legal event as being an intrusion). As a result, to address these types of tasks, practitioners need tools that minimize the total cost computed as a sum of the cost of labeling and the loss associated with the decisions.

Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16396|IJCAI|2007|Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problems From Relaxations to Explanations|The Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem (QCSP) is a generalisation of the classical CSP in which some of variables can be universally quantified.

However, previous results do not address the important classes of stratified programs and its subclass of acyclic (i.e., recursion-free) programs, although they are recognized as important tools for knowledge representation and reasoning. In this paper, we consider such programs, possibly augmented with constraints. Our results show that in the propositional setting, where reasoning is well-known to be polynomial, deciding strong and uniform equivalence is as hard as for arbitrary normal logic programs (and thus coNP-complete), but is polynomial in some restricted cases. Nonground programs behave similarly. However, exponential lower bounds already hold for small programs (i.e., with constantly many rules). In particular, uniform equivalence is undecidable even for small Horn programs plus a single negative constraint.|Thomas Eiter,Michael Fink,Hans Tompits,Stefan Woltran","16539|IJCAI|2007|Epistemic Reasoning in Logic Programs|Although epistemic logic programming has an enhanced capacity to handle complex incomplete information reasoning and represent agents' epistemic behaviours, it embeds a significantly higher computational complexity than non-disjunctive and disjunctive answer set programming.

In particular, we show that Lee and Lifschitz's result on loop formulas for disjunctive logic programs can be extended to a special class of epistemic logic programs. We also study the polysize model property for epistemic logic programs. Based on these discoveries, we identify two non-trivial classes of epistemic logic programs whose consistency checking complexity is reduced from PSPACE-complete to NP-complete and P -complete respectively. We observe that many important applications on epistemic representation fall into these two classes of epistemic logic programs.|Yan Zhang","16108|IJCAI|2005|Strong Equivalence for Logic Programs with Preferences|Recently, strong equivalence for Answer Set Programming has been studied intensively, and was shown to be beneficial for modular programming and automated optimization.

These results provide a clear picture of the relationship of these semantics with respect to strong equivalence, which differs considerably from their relationship with respect to answer sets.

We present a novel algorithm for finite domain constraint optimization that generalizes branch-and-bound search by reasoning about sets of assignments rather than individual assignments. Because in many practical cases, sets of assignments can be represented implicitly and compactly using symbolic techniques such as decision diagrams, the set-based algorithm can compute bounds faster than explicitly searching over individual assignments, while memory explosion can be avoided by limiting the size of the sets. Varying the size of the sets yields a family of algorithms that includes known search and inference algorithms as special cases.

Researchers are investigating ever-more efficient algorithms, yet many applications demand such algorithms bound any loss in policy quality when chasing efficiency. To address this challenge, we present two new techniques. The first approximates in the value space to obtain solutions efficiently for a pre-specified error bound. Unlike existing techniques, our technique guarantees the resulting policy will meet this bound. Furthermore, it does not require costly computations to determine the quality loss of the policy. Our second technique prunes large tracts of belief space that are unreachable, allowing faster policy computation without any sacrifice in optimality. The combination of the two techniques, which are complementary to existing optimal policy generation algorithms, provides solutions with tight error bounds efficiently in domains where competing algorithms fail to provide such tight bounds.|Pradeep Varakantham,Rajiv T.

In this paper, we present and evaluate a decision-theoretic framework that captures the general notion of assistance. The objective is to observe a goal-directed agent and to select assistive actions in order to minimize the overall cost. We model the problem as an assistant POMDP where the hidden state corresponds to the agent's unobserved goals. This formulation allows us to exploit domain models for both estimating the agent's goals and selecting assistive action. In addition, the formulation naturally handles uncertainty, varying action costs, and customization to specific agents via learning. We argue that in many domains myopic heuristics will be adequate for selecting actions in the assistant POMDP and present two such heuristics. We evaluate our approach in two domains where human subjects perform tasks in game-like computer environments.

In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly.

In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming.

So far much of the research has been focused on English due to the lack of semantically annotated resources in other languages. In this paper, we report first results on semantic role labeling using a pre-release version of the Chinese Proposition Bank. Since the Chinese Proposition Bank is superimposed on top of the Chinese Tree-bank, i.e., the semantic role labels are assigned to constituents in a treebank parse tree, we start by reporting results on experiments using the handcrafted parses in the treebank. This will give us a measure of the extent to which the semantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation in the treebank. We will then report experiments using a fully automatic Chinese parser that integrates word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing. This will gauge how successful semantic role labeling can be done for Chinese in realistic situations. We show that our results using hand-crafted parses are slightly higher than the results reported for the state-of-the-art semantic role labeling systems for English using the Penn English Proposition Bank data, even though the Chinese Proposition Bank is smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our system is much lower than the English state-of-the-art.

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution.

The unambiguous V - P - N and N - P -N tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N - P - N tuples of the test corpus. A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation (WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of Vs and Ns in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP, NP - P - NP.

However, since LSI ignores class labels of training documents, LSI generated representations are not as effective in classification tasks. To address this limitation, a process called 'sprinkling' is presented. Sprinkling is a simple extension of LSI based on augmenting the set of features using additional terms that encode class knowledge. However, a limitation of sprinkling is that it treats all classes (and classifiers) in the same way. To overcome this, we propose a more principled extension called Adaptive Sprinkling (AS). AS leverages confusion matrices to emphasise the differences between those classes which are hard to separate. The method is tested on diverse classification tasks, including those where classes share ordinal or hierarchical relationships. These experiments reveal that AS can significantly enhance the performance of instance-based techniques (kNN) to make them competitive with the state-of-the-art SVM classifier.

However, in resource-constrained systems, indiscriminate communication can create performance bottlenecks by consuming valuable bandwidth. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between the utility attained by communication and its cost. Here we address this tradeoff by developing a novel strategy to make communication selective based on information redundancy ensuring communication only occurs when necessary, while maintaining acceptable coordination. We apply this strategy to a state-of-the-art communication protocol to evaluate its resource saving benefit in a distributed network routing problem. Furthermore, we design a mechanism to adapt its selectivity level to the prevailing resource constraints to ensure further improvements. Empirical studies show our selective strategy achieves relative savings in bandwidth usage of -%, with only a -% relative reduction in coordination effectiveness and the adaptive strategy further improves relative bandwidth usage by up to % and also relative coordination effectiveness by up to % over the non-adaptive approach.|Partha Sarathi Dutta,Claudia V.

However, the development of SANNs has traditionally focused on data domains that are assumed to be modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of data governed by other statistical models, such as the Poisson distribution, has received less attention from the data mining community. Based on special considerations of the statistical nature of data following a Poisson distribution, this paper introduces a SANN, Poisson-based Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (PSOTA), which implements novel similarity matching criteria and neuron weight adaptation schemes. It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood. This study indicate that, in comparison to the traditional Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA), PSOTA offers significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization in data modeled by the Poisson distribution, such as serial analysis of gene expression data.|Haiying Wang,Huiru Zheng,Francisco Azuaje","16245|IJCAI|2005|Sophia A novel approach for Textual Case-based Reasoning|In this paper we present a novel methodology for textual case-based reasoning.

Non-critical anomalies occur, however, when actual behavior during plan execution differs only slightly from expectations, and plans still achieve the given goal conjunct. Such anomalies provide the basis for model adjustments that represent small adaptations to the planner's background knowledge. In a multi-agent environment where  or more individual plans can be executing at any one time, automation is required to support model anomaly detection, evaluation and revision.

In our approach, we presume that each motor primitive takes responsibility for controlling a small sub-block of motion, containing coherent muscle activation outputs. A central timing controller cues these subroutines of movement, creating complete movement strategies that are built up by overlaying primitives, thus creating synergies of muscle activation. This partitioning allows the movement to be defined by a sparse code representing the timing of primitive activations. This paper shows that it is possible to use a factorial hidden Markov model to infer primitives in handwriting data. The variation in the handwriting data can to a large extent be explained by timing variation in the triggering of the primitives. Once an appropriate set of primitives has been inferred, the characters can be represented as a set of timings of primitive activations, along with variances, giving a very compact representation of the character. The model is naturally partitioned into a low level primitive output stage, and a top-down primitive timing stage. This partitioning gives us an insight into behaviours such as scribbling, and what is learnt in order to write a new character.|Ben H. Williams,Marc Toussaint,Amos J.

Our experiments demonstrate that CARL not only performs well on individual tasks but also exhibits significant performance gains when allowed to transfer knowledge from previous tasks.|Manu Sharma,Michael P.

A well-known limitation of consistency-based diagnosis is that it is unable to cope with uncertainty. Uncertainty reasoning is nowadays done using Bayesian networks. In this field, a conflict measure has been introduced to detect conflicts between a given probability distribution and associated data. In this paper, we use a probabilistic theory to represent logical diagnostic systems and show that in this theory we are able to determine consistent and inconsistent states as traditionally done in consistency-based diagnosis. Furthermore, we analyse how the conflict measure in this theory offers a way to favour particular diagnoses above others. This enables us to add uncertainty reasoning to consistency-based diagnosis in a seamless fashion.|Ildikó Flesch,Peter J. F. Lucas,Theo P. van der Weide","16474|IJCAI|2007|Kernel Carpentry for Online Regression Using Randomly Varying Coefficient Model|We present a Bayesian formulation of locally weighted learning (LWL) using the novel concept of a randomly varying coefficient model. Based on this, we propose a mechanism for multivariate non-linear regression using spatially localised linear models that learns completely independent of each other, uses only local information and adapts the local model complexity in a data driven fashion. We derive online updates for the model parameters based on variational Bayesian EM. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm against other state-of-the-art methods reveal the excellent, robust generalization performance beside surprisingly efficient time and space complexity properties. This paper, for the first time, brings together the computational efficiency and the adaptability of 'non-competitive' locally weighted learning schemes and the modelling guarantees of the Bayesian formulation.|Narayanan U.

The simulation is configurable and controllable via external programs. Several groups have been using the simulation to study the impact of artificial intelligence tools on space habitat design and control. We outline some of the AI challenges and invite the AI community to use our simulation to further NASA's exploration goals.|David Kortenkamp,Scott Bell"]]}}
