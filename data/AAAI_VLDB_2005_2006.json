We provide a necessary and sufficient graphical condition for the cases when the causal effect of an arbitrary set of variables on another arbitrary set can be determined uniquely from the available information, as well as an algorithm which computes the effect whenever this condition holds. Furthermore, we use our results to prove completeness of do-calculus Pearl, , and a version of an identification algorithm in Tian,  for the same identification problem.

Observed-Action Reasoning is the problem of reasoning about the world state after a sequence of partial observations of actions and states. In this paper we formalize Observed-Action Reasoning, prove intractability results for current techniques, and find tractable algorithms for STRIPS and other actions. Our new algorithms update a representation of all possible world states (the belief state) in logic using new logical constants for unknown objects. A straightforward application of this idea is incorrect, and we identify and add two key amendments. We also present successful experimental results for our algorithm in Blocks-world domains of varying sizes and in Kriegspiel (partially observable chess). These results are promising for relating sensors with symbols, partial-knowledge games, multi-agent decision making, and AI planning.|Megan Nance,Adam Vogel,Eyal Amir","65873|AAAI|2006|Reconciling Situation Calculus and Fluent Calculus|The Situation Calculus and the Fluent Calculus are successful action formalisms that share many concepts.

Furthermore, such a formal relation would allow to combine Golog and FLUX and to analyze which of the underlying computation principles is better suited for different classes of programs. We develop a formal translation between domain axiomatizations of the Situation Calculus and the Fluent Calculus and present a Fluent Calculus semantics for Golog programs. For domains with deterministic actions our approach allows an automatic translation of Golog domain descriptions and execution of Golog programs with FLUX.|Stephan Schiffel,Michael Thielscher","65608|AAAI|2005|Learning Planning Rules in Noisy Stochastic Worlds|We present an algorithm for learning a model of the effects of actions in noisy stochastic worlds.

The challenge is to replicate the success of modern temporal and probabilistic planners with domains that exhibit an interaction between time and uncertainty. We present a general framework for probabilistic temporal planning in which effects, the time at which they occur, and action durations are all probabilistic. This framework includes a search space that is designed for solving probabilistic temporal planning problems via heuristic search, an algorithm that has been tailored to work with it and an effective heuristic based on an extension of the planning graph data structure.

Our algorithm has two unique features an expressive relational language, and an exact tractable computation. An action-schema language that we present permits learning of preconditions and effects that include implicit objects and unstated relationships between objects. For example, we can learn that replacing a blown fuse turns on all the lights whose switch is set to on. The algorithm maintains and outputs a relational-logical representation of all possible action-schema models after a sequence of executed actions and partial observations. Importantly, our algorithm takes polynomial time in the number of time steps and predicates. Time dependence on other domain parameters varies with the action-schema language. Our experiments show that the relational structure speeds up both learning and generalization, and outperforms propositional learning methods. It also allows establishing apriori-unknown connections between objects (e.g. light bulbs and their switches), and permits learning conditional effects in realistic and complex situations. Our algorithm takes advantage of a DAG structure that can be updated efficiently and preserves compactness of representation.|Dafna Shahaf,Eyal Amir","65885|AAAI|2006|Learning Partially Observable Action Models Efficient Algorithms|We present tractable, exact algorithms for learning actions' effects and preconditions in partially observable domains. Our algorithms maintain a propositional logical representation of the set of possible action models after each observation and action execution. The algorithms perform exact learning of preconditions and effects in any deterministic action domain. This includes STRIPS actions and actions with conditional effects. In contrast, previous algorithms rely on approximations to achieve tractability, and do not supply approximation guarantees. Our algorithms take time and space that are polynomial in the number of domain features, and can maintain a representation that stays compact indefinitely. Our experimental results show that we can learn efficiently and practically in domains that contain over 's of features (more than  states).|Dafna Shahaf,Allen Chang,Eyal Amir","65407|AAAI|2005|Reducing Labeling Effort for Structured Prediction Tasks|A common obstacle preventing the rapid deployment of supervised machine learning algorithms is the lack of labeled training data. This is particularly expensive to obtain for structured prediction tasks, where each training instance may have multiple, interacting labels, all of which must be correctly annotated for the instance to be of use to the learner. Traditional active learning addresses this problem by optimizing the order in which the examples are labeled to increase learning efficiency. However, this approach does not consider the difficulty of labeling each example, which can vary widely in structured prediction tasks. For example, the labeling predicted by a partially trained system may be easier to correct for some instances than for others. We propose a new active learning paradigm which reduces not only how many instances the annotator must label, but also how difficult each instance is to annotate. The system also leverages information from partially correct predictions to efficiently solicit annotations from the user. We validate this active learning framework in an interactive information extraction system, reducing the total number of annotation actions by %.|Aron Culotta,Andrew McCallum","65892|AAAI|2006|Using Homomorphisms to Transfer Options across Continuous Reinforcement Learning Domains|We examine the problem of Transfer in Reinforcement Learning and present a method to utilize knowledge acquired in one Markov Decision Process (MDP) to bootstrap learning in a more complex but related MDP. We build on work in model minimization in Reinforcement Learning to define relationships between state-action pairs of the two MDPs. Our main contribution in this work is to provide a way to compactly represent such mappings using relationships between state variables in the two domains. We use these functions to transfer a learned policy in the first domain into an option in the new domain, and apply intra-option learning methods to bootstrap learning in the new domain. We first evaluate our approach in the well known Blocksworld domain. We then demonstrate that our approach to transfer is viable in a complex domain with a continuous state space by evaluating it in the Robosoccer Keepaway domain.|Vishal Soni,Satinder P.

The CTBN framework is based on homogeneous Markov processes, and defines two distributions with respect to each local variable in the system, given its parents an exponential distribution over when the variable transitions, and a multinomial over what is the next value. In this paper, we present two extensions to the framework that make it more useful in modeling practical applications. The first extension models arbitrary transition time distributions using Erlang-Coxian approximations, while maintaining tractable learning. We show how the censored data problem arises in learning the distribution, and present a solution based on expectation-maximization initialized by the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The second extension is a general method for reasoning about negative evidence, by introducing updates that assert no observable events occur over an interval of time. Such updates were not defined in the original CTBN framework, and we show that their inclusion can significantly improve the accuracy of filtering and prediction. We illustrate and evaluate these extensions in two real-world domains, email use and GPS traces of a person traveling about a city.|Karthik Gopalratnam,Henry A. Kautz,Daniel S. Weld","65451|AAAI|2005|Planning in Models that Combine Memory with Predictive Representations of State|Models of dynamical systems based on predictive state representations (PSRs) use predictions of future observations as their representation of state. A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs. Our empirical results show that our modified IP on mPSRs outperforms, in most cases, IP on both PSRs and POMDPs.|Michael R. James,Satinder P.

Artificial intelligence algorithms offer the capability to improve the performance or sensor networks in dynamic environments by minimizing energy utilization while not compromising overall performance. However, they have been used only to a limited extent in sensor networks primarily due to their expensive computing requirements. We describe the use of Markov decision processes for the adaptive control of sensor sampling rates in a sensor network used for human health monitoring. The MDP controller is designed to gather optimal information about the patient's health while guaranteeing a minimum lifetime of the system. At every control step, the MDP controller varies the frequency at which the data is collected according to the criticality of the patient's health at that time. We present a stochastic model that is used to generate the optimal policy offline. In cases where a model of the observed process is not available a-priori. we descrihe a Q-learning technique to learn the control policy, by using a pre-existing master controller.

However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted. Based on the semi-MDP (sMDP) model, we study the hard constrained (HC) problem in continuous time, state and action spaces with respect to both finite and infinite horizons, and various cost criteria. We show that the HCsMDP problem is NP-hard and that there exists an equivalent discrete-time MDP to every HCsMDP. Hence, classical methods such as reinforcement learning can solve HCsMDPs.|Wai-Leong Yeow,Chen-Khong Tham,Wai-Choong Wong","65652|AAAI|2006|An Iterative Algorithm for Solving Constrained Decentralized Markov Decision Processes|Despite the significant progress to extend Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to cooperative multi-agent systems, developing approaches that can deal with realistic problems remains a serious challenge. Existing approaches that solve Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) suffer from the fact that they can only solve relatively small problems without complex constraints on task execution. OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings. Experimental results are shown to support our claims.|Aur√©lie Beynier,Abdel-Illah Mouaddib","65864|AAAI|2006|Targeting Specific Distributions of Trajectories in MDPs|We define TTD-MDPs, a novel class of Markov decision processes where the traditional goal of an agent is changed from finding an optimal trajectory through a state space to realizing a specified distribution of trajectories through the space.

In many applications, e.g., XML security enforcement, it is prohibitively expensive to materialize and maintain a large number of views. Therefore, views are necessarily virtual.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm"],["65605|AAAI|2005|Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Multi-Class Support Vector Machines|We present new unsupervised and semi-supervised training algorithms for multi-class support vector machines based on semidefinite programming.

The long-term goal is automating the process of building a consistent, formalized representation of the world in the Cyc knowledge base via machine learning. We present preliminary results of this work and describe how we expect the knowledge acquisition process to become more accurate, faster, and more automated in the future.|Cynthia Matuszek,Michael J.

They concern with the dynamic allocation of reusable resources over time to non-preemtive interconnected tasks with stochastic durations. The aim is to minimize the expected value of a regular performance measure. First, we formulate the problem as a stochastic shortest path problem and argue that our formulation has favorable properties, e.g., it has finite horizon, it is acyclic, thus, all policies are proper, and moreover, the space of control policies can be safely restricted. Then, we propose an iterative solution. Essentially, we apply a reinforcement learning based adaptive sampler to compute a sub-optimal control policy. We suggest several approaches to enhance this solution and make it applicable to large-scale problems. The main improvements are () the value function is maintained by feature-based support vector regression () the initial exploration is guided by rollout algorithms () the state space is partitioned by clustering the tasks while keeping the precedence constraints satisfied () the action space is decomposed and, consequently, the number of available actions in a state is decreased and, finally, () we argue that the sampling can be effectively distributed among several processors. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by experimental results on both artificial (benchmark) and real-world (industry related) data.|Bal√°zs Csan√°d Cs√°ji,L√°szl√≥ Monostori","65440|AAAI|2005|New Admissible Heuristics for Domain-Independent Planning|Admissible heuristics are critical for effective domain-independent planning when optimal solutions must be guaranteed. Two useful heuristics are the hm heuristics, which generalize the reachability heuristic underlying the planning graph, and pattern database heuristics. These heuristics, however, have serious limitations reachability heuristics capture only the cost of critical paths in a relaxed problem, ignoring the cost of other relevant paths, while PDB heuristics, additive or not, cannot accommodate too many variables in patterns, and methods for automatically selecting patterns that produce good estimates are not known. We introduce two refinements of these heuristics First, the additive hm heuristic which yields an admissible sum of hm heuristics using a partitioning of the set of actions. Second, the constrained PDB heuristic which uses constraints from the original problem to strengthen the lower bounds obtained from abstractions. The new heuristics depend on the way the actions or problem variables are partitioned. We advance methods for automatically deriving additive hm and PDB heuristics from STRIPS encodings. Evaluation shows improvement over existing heuristics in several domains, although, not surprisingly, no heuristic dominates all the others over all domains.|Patrik Haslum,Blai Bonet,Hector Geffner","65441|AAAI|2005|Finding Diverse and Similar Solutions in Constraint Programming|It is useful in a wide range of situations to find solutions which are diverse (or similar) to each other.

It vastly generalizes the NP-complete problem of propositional satisfiability, and hence is both highly useful and extremely expensive to solve in practice. We present a new approach to model counting that is based on adding a carefully chosen number of so-called streamlining constraints to the input formula in order to cut down the size of its solution space in a controlled manner. Each of the additional constraints is a randomly chosen XOR or parity constraint on the problem variables, represented either directly or in the standard CNF form. Inspired by a related yet quite different theoretical study of the properties of XOR constraints, we provide a formal proof that with high probability, the number of XOR constraints added in order to bring the formula to the boundary of being unsatisfiable determines with high precision its model count. Experimentally, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to obtain good bounds on the model counts for formulas that are far beyond the reach of exact counting methods. In fact, we obtain the first non-trivial solution counts for very hard, highly structured combinatorial problem instances. Note that unlike other counting techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we are able to provide high-confidence guarantees on the quality of the counts obtained.|Carla P.

Ideally, this property should be robust to the removal of any single robot from the system. In (Ahmadi & Stone a) we define a property of a team's communication graph that ensures this property, called biconnectivity. In that paper, a distributed algorithm to check if a team of robots is biconnected and its correctness proof are also presented.

For example, consider the problem of multirobot surveillance (Ahmadi & Stone ), in which a team of robots must collaboratively patrol a given area. If any two robots can directly communicate at all times, the robots can coordinate for efficient behavior. This condition holds trivially in environments that are smaller than the robots' communication range. However in larger environments, the robots must actively maintain physical locations such that any two robots can communicate -- possibly through a series of other robots. Otherwise, the robots may lose track of each others' activities and become miscoordinated. Furthermore, since robots are relatively unreliable andor may need to change tasks (for example if a robot is suddenly called by a human user to perform some other task), in a stable multirobot surveillance system, if one of the robots leaves or crashes, the rest should still be able to communicate. Some examples of other tasks that could benefit from any pair of robots being able to communicate with each other, are multi-robot exploration, search and rescue, and cleaning robots. We say that robot R is connected to robot R if there is a series of robots, each within communication range of the previous, which can pass a message from R to R. It is not possible to maintain connectivity in the face of arbitrary numbers of robot departures if there are any two robots that are not within communication of one another and all other robots simultaneously depart, the system becomes disconnected. Thus we focus on the property of remaining robust to any single failure under the assumption that the team can readjust its positioning in response to a departure more quickly than a second departure will occur. In order for the team to stay connected, even in the face of any single departure, it must be the case that every robot is connected to each other robot either directly or via two distinct paths that do not share any robots in common. We call this property biconnectivity the removal of any one robot from the system does not disconnect the remaining robots from each other.|Mazda Ahmadi,Peter Stone","65476|AAAI|2005|Coordinating Agile Systems through the Model-based Execution of Temporal Plans|Agile autonomous systems are emerging, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), that must robustly perform tightly coordinated time-critical missions for example, military surveillance or search-and-rescue scenarios.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs.

We focus, primarily, on the execution of phase-dependent policies. Phases are introduced into a model to represent relevant execution history, but there is no physical manifestation of phases in the real world. We treat phases as partially observable state features and show how a belief distribution over phase configurations can be derived from observable state features through the use of transient analysis for Markov chains. This results in an efficient method for phase tracking during execution that can be combined with the QMDP value method for POMDPs to make action choices. We also discuss, briefly, how the structure of MDPs with phase transitions can be exploited in structured value iteration with symbolic representation of vectors and matrices.|H√•kan L. S.

However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted. Based on the semi-MDP (sMDP) model, we study the hard constrained (HC) problem in continuous time, state and action spaces with respect to both finite and infinite horizons, and various cost criteria. We show that the HCsMDP problem is NP-hard and that there exists an equivalent discrete-time MDP to every HCsMDP. Hence, classical methods such as reinforcement learning can solve HCsMDPs.|Wai-Leong Yeow,Chen-Khong Tham,Wai-Choong Wong","65652|AAAI|2006|An Iterative Algorithm for Solving Constrained Decentralized Markov Decision Processes|Despite the significant progress to extend Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to cooperative multi-agent systems, developing approaches that can deal with realistic problems remains a serious challenge. Existing approaches that solve Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) suffer from the fact that they can only solve relatively small problems without complex constraints on task execution. OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings. Experimental results are shown to support our claims.|Aur√©lie Beynier,Abdel-Illah Mouaddib","65864|AAAI|2006|Targeting Specific Distributions of Trajectories in MDPs|We define TTD-MDPs, a novel class of Markov decision processes where the traditional goal of an agent is changed from finding an optimal trajectory through a state space to realizing a specified distribution of trajectories through the space. After motivating this formulation, we show how to convert a traditional MDP into a TTD-MDP. We derive an algorithm for finding non-deterministic policies by constructing a trajectory tree that allows us to compute locally-consistent policies. We specify the necessary conditions for solving the problem exactly and present a heuristic algorithm for constructing policies when an exact answer is impossible or impractical.

Our main contribution in this work is to provide a way to compactly represent such mappings using relationships between state variables in the two domains. We use these functions to transfer a learned policy in the first domain into an option in the new domain, and apply intra-option learning methods to bootstrap learning in the new domain. We first evaluate our approach in the well known Blocksworld domain.

One important voting rule is the Slater rule. It selects a ranking of the alternatives (or candidates) to minimize the number of pairs of candidates such that the ranking disagrees with the pairwise majority vote on these two candidates. The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates. We show that this technique suffices to compute a Slater ranking in linear time if the pairwise majority graph is hierarchically structured. For the general case, we also give an efficient algorithm for finding a set of similar candidates. We provide experimental results that show that this technique significantly (sometimes drastically) speeds up search algorithms, Finally, we also use the technique of similar sets to show that computing an optimal Slater ranking is NP-hard. even in the absence of pairwise ties.|Vincent Conitzer","65757|AAAI|2006|Diagnosis of Multi-Robot Coordination Failures Using Distributed CSP Algorithms|With increasing deployment of systems involving multiple coordinating agents, there is a growing need for diagnosing coordination failures in such systems.

We model the coordination between the agents as a constraint graph, and adapt several algorithms from the distributed CSP area, to use as the basis for the diagnosis algorithms. We evaluate the algorithms in extensive experiments with simulated and real Sony Aibo robots and show that in general a trade-off exists between the computational requirements of the algorithms, and their diagnosis results. Surprisingly, in contrast to results in distributed CSPs, the asynchronous backtracking algorithm outperforms stochastic local search in terms of both quality and runtime.|Meir Kalech,Gal A.

When the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide, we get the ranking systems setting. A famous type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines. Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered. In this paper we define three measures for quantifying the incentive compatibility of ranking systems. We apply these measures to several known ranking systems, such as PageRank, and prove tight bounds on the level of incentive compatibility under two basic properties strong monotonicity and non-imposition. We also introduce two novel nonimposing ranking systems, one general, and the other for the case of systems with three participants.

That is, we study the ability of an election's chair to, through such mechanisms as votercandidate additionsuppressionpartition, ensure that a particular candidate (equivalently, alternative) does not win. And we study the extent to which election systems can make it impossible, or computationally costly (NP-complete), for the chair to execute such control. Among the systems we study--plurality, Condorcet, and approval voting--we find cases where systems immune or computationally resistant to a chair choosing the winner nonetheless are vulnerable to the chair blocking a victory. Beyond that, we see that among our studied systems no one system offers the best protection against destructive control. Rather, the choice of a preference aggregation system will depend closely on which types of control one wishes to be protected against. We also find concrete cases where the complexity of or susceptibility to control varies dramatically based on the choice among natural tie-handling rules.|Edith Hemaspaandra,Lane A.

We obtain both polynomial-time bribery algorithms and proofs of the intractability of bribery, and indeed our results show that the complexity of bribery is extremely sensitive to the setting. For example, we find settings in which bribery is NP-complete but manipulation (by voters) is in P, and we find settings in which bribing weighted voters is NP-complete but bribing voters with individual bribe thresholds is in P. For the broad class of elections (including plurality, Borda, k-approval, and veto) known as scoring protocols, we prove a dichotomy result for bribery of weighted voters We find a simple-to-evaluate condition that classifies every case as either NP-complete or in P.|Piotr Faliszewski,Edith Hemaspaandra,Lane A.

The domain user must then tune the system select the right component to be executed and correctly adjust their numerous \"knobs\" (e.g., thresholds, formula coefficients). Tuning is skill- and time-intensive, but (as we show) without it the matching accuracy is significantly inferior.We describe eTuner, an approach to automatically tune schema matching systems. Given a schema S, we match S against synthetic schemas, for which the ground truth mapping is known, and find a tuning that demonstrably improves the performance of matching S against real schemas. To efficiently search the huge space of tuning configurations, eTuner works sequentially, starting with tuning the lowest level components. To increase the applicability of eTuner, we develop methods to tune a broad range of matching components. While the tuning process is completely automatic, eTuner can also exploit user assistance (whenever available) to further improve the tuning quality. We employed eTuner to tune four recently developed matching systems on several real-world domains. eTuner produced tuned matching systems that achieve higher accuracy than using the systems with currently possible tuning methods, at virtually no cost to the domain user.|Mayssam Sayyadian,Yoonkyong Lee,AnHai Doan,Arnon Rosenthal","65679|AAAI|2006|Nonexistence of Voting Rules That Are Usually Hard to Manipulate|Aggregating the preferences of self-interested agents is a key problem for multiagent systems, and one general method for doing so is to vote over the alternatives (candidates). Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm","80594|VLDB|2005|Efficient Computation of the Skyline Cube|Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for multi-criteria decision making, data mining and visualization, and user-preference queries.

Based on these sharing strategies, two novel algorithms, Bottom-Up and Top-Down algorithms, are proposed to compute SKYCUBE efficiently.

Our approach partitions the collection of continuous queries into groups based on the clustering patterns of the query ranges, and then applies specialized processing strategies to those heavily-clustered groups (or hotspots). To maintain the partition dynamically, we present efficient algorithms that maintain a nearly optimal partition in nearly amortized logarithmic time. We show how to use the hotspots to scalably process large numbers of continuous select-join and band-join queries, which are much more challenging than simple range selection queries. Experiments demonstrate that this approach can improve the processing throughput by orders of magnitude. As another application of hotspots, we show how to use them to build a high-quality histogram for intervals in linear time.|Pankaj K.

In this paper we study k-NN monitoring in road networks, where the distance between a query and a data object is determined by the length of the shortest path connecting them. We propose two methods that can handle arbitrary object and query moving patterns, as well as fluctuations of edge weights. The first one maintains the query results by processing only updates that may invalidate the current NN sets. The second method follows the shared execution paradigm to reduce the processing time. In particular, it groups together the queries that fall in the path between two consecutive intersections in the network, and produces their results by monitoring the NN sets of these intersections. We experimentally verify the applicability of the proposed techniques to continuous monitoring of large data and query sets.|Kyriakos Mouratidis,Man Lung Yiu,Dimitris Papadias,Nikos Mamoulis","80503|VLDB|2005|Sketching Streams Through the Net Distributed Approximate Query Tracking|Emerging large-scale monitoring applications require continuous tracking of complex data-analysis queries over collections of physically-distributed streams. Effective solutions have to be simultaneously spacetime efficient (at each remote monitor site), communication efficient (across the underlying communication network), and provide continuous, guaranteed-quality approximate query answers. In this paper, we propose novel algorithmic solutions for the problem of continuously tracking a broad class of complex aggregate queries in such a distributed-streams setting. Our tracking schemes maintain approximate query answers with provable error guarantees, while simultaneously optimizing the storage space and processing time at each remote site, and the communication cost across the network. They rely on tracking general-purpose randomized sketch summaries of local streams at remote sites along with concise prediction models of local site behavior in order to produce highly communication- and spacetime-efficient solutions. The result is a powerful approximate query tracking framework that readily incorporates several complex analysis queries (including distributed join and multi-join aggregates, and approximate wavelet representations), thus giving the first known low-overhead tracking solution for such queries in the distributed-streams model.|Graham Cormode,Minos N.

One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

Holistic twig query processing techniques ,  have been developed to minimize the intermediate results, namely, those root-to-leaf path matches that are not in the final twig results. However, useless path matches cannot be completely avoided, especially when there is a parent-child relationship in the twig query. Furthermore, existing approaches do not consider the fact that in practice, in order to process XPath or XQuery statements, a more powerful form of twig queries, namely, Generalized-Tree-Pattern (GTP)  queries, is required. Most existing works on processing GTP queries generally calls for costly post-processing for eliminating redundant data andor grouping of the matching results.In this paper, we first propose a novel hierarchical stack encoding scheme to compactly represent the twig results. We introduce TwigStack, a bottom-up algorithm for processing twig queries based on this encoding scheme. Then we show how to efficiently enumerate the query results from the encodings for a given GTP query. To our knowledge, this is the first GTP matching solution that avoids any post path-join, sort, duplicate elimination and grouping operations. Extensive performance studies on various data sets and queries show that the proposed TwigStack algorithm not only has better twig query processing performance than state-of-the-art algorithms, but is also capable of efficiently processing the more complex GTP queries.|Songting Chen,Hua-Gang Li,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Wang-Pin Hsiung,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

As in relational cost estimation, COMET exploits a set of system catalog statistics that summarizes the XML data the set of \"simple path\" statistics that we propose is new, and is well suited to the XML setting. Unlike the traditional approach, COMET uses a new statistical learning technique called \"transform regression\" instead of detailed analytical models to predict the overall cost. Besides rendering the cost estimation problem tractable for XML queries, COMET has the further advantage of enabling the query optimizer to be self-tuning, automatically adapting to changes over time in the query workload and in the system environment. We demonstrate COMET's feasibility by developing a cost model for the recently proposed XNAV navigational operator. Empirical studies with synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets show that COMET can quickly obtain accurate cost estimates for a variety of XML queries and data sets.|Ning Zhang 0002,Peter J.

Our main result is an algorithm for arranging a query's web service calls into a pipelined execution plan that optimally exploits parallelism among web services to minimize the query's total running time. Surprisingly, the optimal plan can be found in polynomial time even in the presence of arbitrary precedence constraints among web services, in contrast to traditional query optimization where the analogous problem is NP-hard. We also give an algorithm for determining the optimal granularity of data \"chunks\" to be used for each web service call. Experiments with an initial prototype indicate that our algorithms can lead to significant performance improvement over more straightforward techniques.|Utkarsh Srivastava,Kamesh Munagala,Jennifer Widom,Rajeev Motwani","80519|VLDB|2005|Database Change Notifications Primitives for Efficient Database Query Result Caching|Many database applications implement caching of data from a back-end database server to avoid repeated round trips to the back-end and to improve response times for end-user requests. For example, consider a web application that caches dynamic web content in the mid-tier , . The content of dynamic web pages is usually assembled from data stored in the underlying database system and subject to modification whenever the data sources are modified. The workload is ideal for caching query results most queries are read-only (browsing sessions) and only a small portion of the queries are actually modifying data. Caching at the mid-tier helps off-load the back-end database servers and can increase scalability of a distributed system drastically.|C√©sar A.

Such a knowledge base is constituted by two components, called TBox and ABox. The former expresses general knowledge about the concepts and their relationships, whereas the latter describes the state of affairs regarding the instances of concepts. We investigate the case where the update affects only the instance level of the ontology, i.e., the ABox. Building on classical approaches on knowledge base update, our first contribution is to provide a general semantics for instance level update in Description Logics. We then focus on DL-Lite, a specific Description Logic where the basic reasoning tasks are computationally tractable. We show that DL-Lite is closed with respect to instance level update, in the sense that the result of an update is always expressible as a new DL-Lite ABox. Finally we provide an algorithm that computes the result of an update in DL-Lite, and we show that it runs in polynomial time with respect to the size of both the original knowledge base and the update formula.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Antonella Poggi,Riccardo Rosati","65469|AAAI|2005|Description Logic-Ground Knowledge Integration and Management|This abstract describes ongoing work in developing large-scale knowledge repositories.

A straightforward application of this idea is incorrect, and we identify and add two key amendments.

However, most approaches define new languages for querying RDF data, which has the following shortcomings ) They are difficult to integrate with SQL queries used in database applications, and ) They incur inefficiency as data has to be transformed from SQL to the corresponding language data format. This paper proposes a SQL based scheme that avoids these problems. Specifically, it introduces a SQL table function RDFMATCH to query RDF data. The results of RDFMATCH table function can be further processed by SQL's rich querying capabilities and seamlessly combined with queries on traditional relational data. Furthermore, the RDFMATCH table function invocation is rewritten as a SQL query, thereby avoiding run-time table function procedural overheads. It also enables optimization of rewritten query in conjunction with the rest of the query. The resulting query is executed efficiently by making use of B-tree indexes as well as specialized subject-property materialized views. This paper describes the functionality of the RDFMATCH table function for querying RDF data, which can optionally include user-defined rulebases, and discusses its implementation in Oracle RDBMS. It also presents an experimental study characterizing the overhead eliminated by avoiding procedural code at runtime, characterizing performance under various input conditions, and demonstrating scalability using  million RDF triples from UniProt protein and annotation data.|Eugene Inseok Chong,Souripriya Das,George Eadon,Jagannathan Srinivasan","65505|AAAI|2005|Knowledge Integration for Description Logics|Description logic reasoners are able to detect incoherences (such as logical inconsistency and concept unsatisfiability) in knowledge bases, but provide little support for resolving them.

We show that in DL-Lite the usual DL reasoning tasks are polynomial in the size of the TBox, and query answering is polynomial in the size of the ABox (i.e., in data complexity). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of polynomial data complexity for query answering over DL knowledge bases. A notable feature of our logic is to allow for a separation between TBox and ABox reasoning during query evaluation the part of the process requiring TBox reasoning is independent of the ABox, and the part of the process requiring access to the ABox can be carried out by an SQL engine, thus taking advantage of the query optimization strategies provided by current DBMSs.|Diego Calvanese,Giuseppe De Giacomo,Domenico Lembo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Riccardo Rosati","80586|VLDB|2005|Querying Business Processes with BP-QL|We present in this paper BP-QL, a novel query language for querying business processes.

To model a service, the user has to specify semantic types of the input and output data it uses and its functionality. As large number of new services come online, it is impractical to require the user to come up with a semantic model of the service or rely on the service providers to conform to a standard. Instead, we would like to automatically learn the semantic model of a new service. This paper addresses one part of the problem namely, automatically recognizing semantic types of the data used by Web services. We describe a metadata-based classification method for recognizing input data types using only the terms extracted from a Web Service Definition file. We then verify the classifier's predictions by invoking the service with some sample data of that type. Once we discover correct classification, we invoke the service to produce output data samples. We then use content-based classifiers to recognize semantic types of the output data. We provide performance results of both classification methods and validate our approach on several live Web services.|Kristina Lerman,Anon Plangprasopchok,Craig A.

We propose a general-purpose Web Service Management System (WSMS) that enables querying multiple web services in a transparent and integrated fashion. This paper tackles a first basic WSMS problem query optimization for Select-Project-Join queries spanning multiple web services. Our main result is an algorithm for arranging a query's web service calls into a pipelined execution plan that optimally exploits parallelism among web services to minimize the query's total running time. Surprisingly, the optimal plan can be found in polynomial time even in the presence of arbitrary precedence constraints among web services, in contrast to traditional query optimization where the analogous problem is NP-hard. We also give an algorithm for determining the optimal granularity of data \"chunks\" to be used for each web service call. Experiments with an initial prototype indicate that our algorithms can lead to significant performance improvement over more straightforward techniques.|Utkarsh Srivastava,Kamesh Munagala,Jennifer Widom,Rajeev Motwani","65813|AAAI|2006|Spinning Multiple Social Networks for Semantic Web|Social networks are important for the Semantic Web.

The Loadstar system introduces load shedding techniques to classifying multiple data streams of large volume and high speed. Loadstar uses a novel metric known as the quality of decision (QoD) to measure the level of uncertainty in classification. Resources are then allocated to sources where uncertainty is high. To make optimum classification decisions and accurate QoD measurement, Loadstar relies on feature prediction to model the data dropped by the load shedding mechanism. Furthermore, Loadstar is able to adapt to the changing data characteristics in data streams. The system thus offers a nice solution to data mining with resource constraints.|Yun Chi,Haixun Wang,Philip S.

We identify two such classes single occurrence regular expressions (SOREs) and chain regular expressions (CHAREs). Both classes capture the far majority of the regular expressions occurring in practical DTDs and are succinct by definition. We present the algorithm iDTD (infer DTD) that learns SOREs from strings by first inferring an automaton by known techniques and then translating that automaton to a corresponding SORE, possibly by repairing the automaton when no equivalent SORE can be found. In the process, we introduce a novel automaton to regular expression rewrite technique which is of independent interest. We show that iDTD outperforms existing systems in accuracy, conciseness and speed. In a scenario where only a very small amount of XML data is available, for instance when generated by Web service requests or by answers to queries, iDTD produces regular expressions which are too specific. Therefore, we introduce a novel learning algorithm CRX that directly infers CHAREs (which form a subclass of SOREs) without going through an automaton representation. We show that CRX performs very well within its target class on very small data sets. Finally, we discuss incremental computation, noise, numerical predicates, and the generation of XML Schemas.|Geert Jan Bex,Frank Neven,Thomas Schwentick,Karl Tuyls","80622|VLDB|2006|Query Processing in the AquaLogic Data Services Platform|BEA recently introduced a new middleware product called the Aqua-Logic Data Services Platform (ALDSP).

When overloaded, the system must shed load in order to maintain low-latency query results. In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

Redundantly stored information can lead not just to a higher data storage cost, but also to increased costs for data transfer and data manipulation. Furthermore, such data redundancies can lead to potential update anomalies, rendering the database inconsistent.One way to avoid data redundancies is to employ good schema design based on known functional dependencies. In fact, several recent studies have focused on defining the notion of XML Functional Dependencies (XML FDs) to capture XML data redundancies. We observe further that XML databases are often \"casually designed\" and XML FDs may not be determined in advance. Under such circumstances, discovering XML data redundancies (in terms of FDs) from the data itself becomes necessary and is an integral part of the schema refinement process.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first system, DiscoverXFD, for effcient discovery of XML data redundancies. It employs a novel XML data structure and introduces a new class of partition based algorithms. DiscoverXFD can not only be used for the previous definitions of XML functional dependencies, but also for a more comprehensive notion we develop in this paper, capable of detecting redundancies involving set elements while maintaining clear semantics.

Due to continuous changes in these values, and limited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), it is often infeasible for the database to store the exact values at all times. Queries that uses these old values can produce invalid results. In order to manage the uncertainty between the actual sensor value and the database value, we propose a system called U-DBMS. U-DBMS extends the database system with uncertainty management functionalities.

In the Semantic Web and other domains, ontologies are increasingly seen also as a mechanism to access and query data repositories. This novel context poses an original combination of challenges that has not been addressed before (i) sufficient expressive power of the DL to capture common data modeling constructs (ii) well established and flexible query mechanisms such as Conjunctive Queries (CQs) (iii) optimization of inference techniques with respect to data size, which typically dominates the size of ontologies. This calls for investigating data complexity of query answering in expressive DLs. While the complexity of DLs has been studied extensively, data complexity has been characterized only for answering atomic queries, and was still open for answering CQs in expressive DLs. We tackle this issue and prove a tight CONP upper bound for the problem in SHIQ, as long as no transitive roles occur in the query. We thus establish that for a whole range of DLs from AL to SHIQ, answering CQs with no transitive roles has CONP-complete data complexity. We obtain our result by a novel tableaux-based algorithm for checking query entailment, inspired by the one in , but which manages the technical challenges of simultaneous inverse roles and number restrictions (which leads to a DL lacking the finite model property).|Magdalena Ortiz,Diego Calvanese,Thomas Eiter","80593|VLDB|2005|WmXML A System for Watermarking XML Data|As increasing amount of data is published in the form of XML, copyright protection of XML data is becoming an important requirement for many applications.

In order for coalitions to be stable, a key question that must be answered is how the gains from cooperation are to be distributed. Recent research has revealed that traditional solution concepts, such as the Shapley value, core, least core, and nucleolus, are vulnerable to various manipulations in open anonymous environments such as the Internet. These manipulations include submitting false names, collusion, and hiding some skills. To address this, a solution concept called the anonymity-proof core, which is robust against such manipulations, was developed. However, the representation size of the outcome function in the anonymity-proof core (and similar concepts) requires space exponential in the number of agentsskills. This paper proposes a compact representation of the outcome function, given that the characteristic function is represented using a recently introduced compact language that explicitly specifies only coalitions that introduce synergy. This compact representation scheme can successfully express the outcome function in the anonymity-proof core. Furthermore, this paper develops a new solution concept, the anonymity-proof nucleolus, that is also expressible in this compact representation. We show that the anonymity-proof nucleolus always exists, is unique, and is in the anonymity-proof core (if the latter is nonempty). and assigns the same value to symmetric skills.|Naoki Ohta,Atsushi Iwasaki,Makoto Yokoo,Kohki Maruono,Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm","65805|AAAI|2006|Probabilistic Self-Localization for Sensor Networks|This paper describes a technique for the probabilistic self-localization of a sensor network based on noisy inter-sensor range data.

Probabilistic planners can reason over the missing information and produce plans that take into account the uncertainty about the environment. Unfortunately though, they can rarely scale up to the problems that are of interest in real-world. In this paper, however, we show that for a certain subset of problems we can develop a very efficient probabilistic planner. The proposed planner, called PPCP, is applicable to the problems for which it is clear what values of the missing information would result in the best plan. In other words, there exists a clear preference for the actual values of the missing information. For example, in the problem of robot navigation in partially-known environments it is always preferred to find out that an initially unknown location is traversable rather than not. The planner we propose exploits this property by using a series of deterministic A*-like searches to construct and refine a policy in anytime fashion. On the theoretical side, we show that once converged, the policy is guaranteed to be optimal under certain conditions. On the experimental side, we show the power of PPCP on the problem of robot navigation in partially-known terrains. The planner can scale up to very large environments with thousands of initially unknown locations. We believe that this is several orders of magnitude more unknowns than what the current probabilistic planners developed for the same problem can handle. Also, despite the fact that the problem we experimented on in general does not satisfy the conditions for the solution optimality, PPCP still produces the solutions that are nearly always optimal.|Maxim Likhachev,Anthony Stentz","80561|VLDB|2005|SVM in Oracle Database g Removing the Barriers to Widespread Adoption of Support Vector Machines|Contemporary commercial databases are placing an increased emphasis on analytic capabilities.

In particular, we show how outlier detection can be encoded in the large margin training principle of support vector machines. By expressing a convex relaxation of the joint training problem as a semide finite program, one can use this approach to robustly train a support vector machine while suppressing outliers. We demonstrate that our approach can yield superior results to the standard soft margin approach in the presence of outliers.|Linli Xu,Koby Crammer,Dale Schuurmans"],["65712|AAAI|2006|Exploration of the Robustness of Plans|This paper considers the problem of stochastic robustness testing for plans.

However, it is possible to diagnose such failures using a model of the coordination between agents.

To be dependable, these groups must plan, carry out and adapt their activities in a way that is robust to failure and uncertainty. Previous work has produced contingent plan execution systems that provide robustness during their plan extraction phase, by choosing between functionally redundant methods, and during their execution phase, by dispatching temporally flexible plans. Previous contingent execution systems use a centralized architecture in which a single agent conducts planning for the entire group. This can result in a communication bottleneck at the time when plan activities are passed to the other agents for execution, and state information is returned. This paper introduces the plan extraction component of a robust, distributed executive for contingent plans. Contingent plans are encoded as Temporal Plan Networks (TPNs), which use a non-deterministic choice operator to compose temporally flexible plan fragments into a nested hierarchy of contingencies. To execute a TPN, the TPN is first distributed over multiple agents, by creating a hierarchical ad-hoc network and by mapping the TPN onto this hierarchy. Second, candidate plans are extracted from the TPN using a distributed, parallel algorithm that exploits the structure of the TPN. Third, the temporal consistency of each candidate plan is tested using a distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm. Each stage of plan extraction distributes communication to adjacent agents in the TPN, and in so doing eliminates communication bottlenecks. In addition, the distributed algorithm reduces the computational load on each agent. The algorithm is empirically validated on a range of randomly generated contingent plans.|Stephen A.

Although Best-First Trajectory Enumeration (BFTE) is efficient, ignoring the additional trajectories that lead to the same state can significantly underestimate the true state probability and result in misdiagnosis. This paper introduces an innovative belief approximation technique, called Best-First Belief State Enumeration (BFBSE), that addresses this limitation by computing estimate probabilities directly from the HMM belief state update equations. Theoretical and empirical results show that BFBSE significantly increases estimator accuracy, uses less memory, and requires less computation time when enumerating a moderate number of estimates for the approximate belief state of subsystem sized models.|Oliver B.

Existing research on scene understanding is typically focused on classifying a scene into classes that are of the same category type. These approaches, although they solve some scene-understanding tasks successfully, in general fail to address the semantics in scene understanding. For example, how does an agent learn the concept label \"red\" and \"ball\" without being told that it is a color or a shape label in advance To cope with this problem, we have proposed a novel research called semantic scene concept learning. Our proposed approach models the task of scene understanding as a \"multi-labeling\" classification problem. Each scene instance perceived by the agent may receive multiple labels coming from different concept categories, where the goal of learning is to let the agent discover the semantic meanings, i.e., the set of relevant visual features, of the scene labels received. Our preliminary experiments have shown the effectiveness of our proposed approach in solving this special intra- and inter-category mixing learning task.|Weiyu Zhu","65627|AAAI|2006|QUICR-Learning for Multi-Agent Coordination|Coordinating multiple agents that need to perform a sequence of actions to maximize a system level reward requires solving two distinct credit assignment problems. First, credit must be assigned for an action taken at time step t that results in a reward at time step t  t. Second, credit must be assigned for the contribution of agent i to the overall system performance. The first credit assignment problem is typically addressed with temporal difference methods such as Q-learning. The second credit assignment problem is typically addressed by creating custom reward functions. To address both credit assignment problems simultaneously, we propose the \"Q Updates with Immediate Counterfactual Rewards-learning\" (QUICR-learning) designed to improve both the convergence properties and performance of Q-learning in large multi-agent problems. QUICR-learning is based on previous work on single-time-step counterfactual rewards described by the collectives framework. Results on a traffic congestion problem shows that QUICR-learning is significantly better than a Q-learner using collectives-based (single-time-step counterfactual) rewards. In addition QUICR-learning provides significant gains over conventional and local Q-learning. Additional results on a multi-agent grid-world problem show that the improvements due to QUICR-learning are not domain specific and can provide up to a ten fold increase in performance over existing methods.|Adrian K.

Examples of such large-scale, networked multi-agent systems include peer-to-peer networks, distributed information retrieval, and agent-based supply chains. One way of dealing with the uncertain and dynamic nature of such environments is to endow agents with the ability to modify the agent social network by autonomously adapting their local connectivity structure. In this paper, we present a framework for agent-organized networks (AONs) in the context of multi-agent production and exchange, and experimentally evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of specific AON strategies. We find that decentralized network adaptation can significantly improve organizational performance. Additionally, we analyze several properties of the resulting network structures and consider their relationship to the observed increase in organizational performance.|Matthew E.

We demonstrate that variational inference is well suited to solve this problem.

Our algorithm has two unique features an expressive relational language, and an exact tractable computation. An action-schema language that we present permits learning of preconditions and effects that include implicit objects and unstated relationships between objects. For example, we can learn that replacing a blown fuse turns on all the lights whose switch is set to on. The algorithm maintains and outputs a relational-logical representation of all possible action-schema models after a sequence of executed actions and partial observations. Importantly, our algorithm takes polynomial time in the number of time steps and predicates. Time dependence on other domain parameters varies with the action-schema language. Our experiments show that the relational structure speeds up both learning and generalization, and outperforms propositional learning methods. It also allows establishing apriori-unknown connections between objects (e.g. light bulbs and their switches), and permits learning conditional effects in realistic and complex situations. Our algorithm takes advantage of a DAG structure that can be updated efficiently and preserves compactness of representation.|Dafna Shahaf,Eyal Amir","65885|AAAI|2006|Learning Partially Observable Action Models Efficient Algorithms|We present tractable, exact algorithms for learning actions' effects and preconditions in partially observable domains.

The algorithms perform exact learning of preconditions and effects in any deterministic action domain. This includes STRIPS actions and actions with conditional effects. In contrast, previous algorithms rely on approximations to achieve tractability, and do not supply approximation guarantees. Our algorithms take time and space that are polynomial in the number of domain features, and can maintain a representation that stays compact indefinitely.

Large action sets, however, have received considerably less attention. This paper demonstrates the use of knowledge transfer between related tasks to accelerate learning with large action sets. We introduce action transfer, a technique that extracts the actions from the (near-)optimal solution to the first task and uses them in place of the full action set when learning any subsequent tasks. When optimal actions make up a small fraction of the domain's action set, action transfer can substantially reduce the number of actions and thus the complexity of the problem. However, action transfer between dissimilar tasks can be detrimental. To address this difficulty, we contribute randomized task perturbation (RTP), an enhancement to action transfer that makes it robust to unrepresentative source tasks. We motivate RTP action transfer with a detailed theoretical analysis featuring a formalism of related tasks and a bound on the suboptimality of action transfer. The empirical results in this paper show the potential of RTP action transfer to substantially expand the applicability of RL to problems with large action sets.|Alexander A.

However, learning in multi-agent systems does not necessarily involve the participation of other agents directly in the inductive process itself. Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately, or single-agent learning. In this paper we present a new framework, named the Multi-Agent Inductive Learning System (MAILS), that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents. The MAILS framework combines inverse entailment with an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge in a multi-agent setting, facilitating a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates when required. The benefits of the new approach are demonstrated for inducing declarative program fragments in a multi-agent distributed programming system.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

However, much of the work on forgetting, and other related approaches such as independence, irrelevance and novelty, has been restricted to the classical logics. This paper describes a detailed theoretical investigation of the notion of forgetting in the context of logic programming. We first provide a semantic definition of forgetting under the answer sets for extended logic programs. We then discuss the desirable properties and some motivating examples. An important result of this study is an algorithm for computing the result of forgetting in a logic program. Furthermore, we present a modified version of the algorithm and show that the time complexity of the new algorithm is polynomial with respect to the size of the given logic program if the size of certain rules is fixed. We show how the proposed theory of forgetting can be used to characterize the logic program updates.|Kewen Wang,Abdul Sattar,Kaile Su","65701|AAAI|2006|Forgetting and Conflict Resolving in Disjunctive Logic Programming|We establish a declarative theory of forgetting for disjunctive logic programs.

A transformation-based algorithm is also developed for computing the result of forgetting. We also provide an analysis of computational complexity. As an application of our approach, a fairly general framework for resolving conflicts in inconsistent knowledge bases represented by disjunctive logic programs is defined. The basic idea of our framework is to weaken the preferences of each agent by forgetting certain knowledge that causes inconsistency.

In this paper we propose a tableau-like procedure for finding maximally concept-satisfiable terminologies represented in the description logic ALC.

The former expresses general knowledge about the concepts and their relationships, whereas the latter describes the state of affairs regarding the instances of concepts. We investigate the case where the update affects only the instance level of the ontology, i.e., the ABox. Building on classical approaches on knowledge base update, our first contribution is to provide a general semantics for instance level update in Description Logics. We then focus on DL-Lite, a specific Description Logic where the basic reasoning tasks are computationally tractable. We show that DL-Lite is closed with respect to instance level update, in the sense that the result of an update is always expressible as a new DL-Lite ABox. Finally we provide an algorithm that computes the result of an update in DL-Lite, and we show that it runs in polynomial time with respect to the size of both the original knowledge base and the update formula.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Antonella Poggi,Riccardo Rosati","65774|AAAI|2006|Towards an Axiom System for Default Logic|Recently, Lakemeyer and Levesque proposed a logic of only-knowing which precisely captures three forms of nonmonotonic reasoning Moore's Autoepistemic Logic, Konolige's variant based on moderately grounded expansions, and Reiter's default logic.

Moreover, the logic itself is monotonic, that is, nonmonotonic reasoning is cast in terms of validity in the classical sense. While Lakemeyer and Levesque gave a model-theoretic account of their logic, a proof-theoretic characterization remained open. This paper fills that gap for the propositional subset a sound and complete axiom system in the new logic for all three varieties of default reasoning.

Researchers often advocate the use of compilation-based approaches to store the set of environments (resp. solutions) to a diagnosis (resp. reconfiguration) problem, in some compact representation.

We show that approximate compilation is an effective means of generating the highest-valued environments, while obtaining a representation whose size can be tailored to any embedded application. The method also provides a graceful way to tradeoff space requirements with the completeness of our coverage of the environment space.|Barry O'Sullivan,Gregory M.

However, many users of search engines have a particular genre in mind for the desired documents. The genre of a document concerns aspects of the document such as the style or readability, presentation layout, and meta-content such as words in the title or the existence of graphs or photos. By including genre in Web searches, we hypothesize that Web document retrieval could greatly improve accuracy by better matching documents to the user's information needs. Before implementing a search engine capable of discriminating on both genre and topic, a feasibility analysis of genre classification is needed. Our previous research achieved % classification accuracy across ten genres, whereas similar research range between  and % accuracy. However, the ten genres used in our research were mostly distinct and only exemplar Web documents (consisting of only one genre) were chosen. This paper discusses our current work which involves an in-depth analysis of maintaining high accuracy rates among genres that are very similar.|Elizabeth Sugar Boese,Adele E.

Motivated by this challenge, much effort has been concentrated on developing scalable versions of machine learning algorithms. An often overlooked issue is that large datasets are rarely labeled with the outputs that we wish to learn to predict, due to the human labor required. We make the key observation that analysts can often use queries to define labels for cases, which leads to the problem of learning to predict such query-produced labels. Of course, if a dataset is available in its entirety, we can simply run the query again to compute labels. The interesting scenarios are those where, after the predictive model is trained, new data is gathered at significant incremental cost and, perhaps, over time. The challenge is to accurately predict the query-labels for the projected completion of new datasets, based only on certain cost-effective subsets, which we call bellwethers.|Bee-Chung Chen,Raghu Ramakrishnan,Jude W.

This technology poses many new challenges on current data management systems. RFID data are time-dependent, dynamically changing, in large volumes, and carry implicit semantics. RFID data management systems need to effectively support such large scale temporal data created by RFID applications. These systems need to have an explicit temporal data model for RFID data to support tracking and monitoring queries. In addition, they need to have an automatic method to transform the primitive observations from RFID readers into derived data used in RFID-enabled applications. In this paper, we present an integrated RFID data management system -- Siemens RFID Middleware -- based on an expressive temporal data model for RFID data. Our system enables semantic RFID data filtering and automatic data transformation based on declarative rules, provides powerful query support of RFID object tracking and monitoring, and can be adapted to different RFID-enabled applications.|Fusheng Wang,Peiya Liu","80496|VLDB|2005|MIX A Meta-data Indexing System for XML|We present a system for efficient meta-data indexed querying of XML documents.

We address the meta-data indexing problem of efficiently identifying the XML elements along a location step in an XPath query, that satisfy meta-data range constraints. Our system, named MIX, incorporates query processing on all XPath axes suitably enhanced with meta-data features offering not only query answering but also dynamic maintenance of meta-data levels for XML documents.|SungRan Cho,Nick Koudas,Divesh Srivastava","80723|VLDB|2006|Crimson A Data Management System to Support Evaluating Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction Algorithms|Evolutionary and systems biology increasingly rely on the construction of large phylogenetic trees which represent the relationships between species of interest. As the number and size of such trees increases, so does the need for efficient data storage and query capabilities. Although much attention has been focused on XML as a tree data model, phylogenetic trees differ from document-oriented applications in their size and depth, and their need for structure-based queries rather than path-based queries.This paper focuses on Crimson, a tree storage system for phylogenetic trees used to evaluate phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms within the context of the NSF CIPRes project. A goal of the modeling component of the CIPRes project is to construct a huge simulation tree representing a \"gold standard\" of evolutionary history against which phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms can be tested.In this demonstration, we highlight our storage and indexing strategies and show how Crimson is used for benchmarking phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms. We also show how our design can be used to support more general queries over phylogenetic trees.|Yifeng Zheng,Stephen Fisher,Shirley Cohen,Sheng Guo,Junhyong Kim,Susan B.

Due to continuous changes in these values, and limited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), it is often infeasible for the database to store the exact values at all times. Queries that uses these old values can produce invalid results. In order to manage the uncertainty between the actual sensor value and the database value, we propose a system called U-DBMS. U-DBMS extends the database system with uncertainty management functionalities. In particular, each data value is represented as an interval and a probability distribution function, and it can be processed with probabilistic query operators to produce imprecise (but correct) answers. This demonstration presents a PostgreSQL-based system that handles uncertainty and probabilistic queries for constantly-evolving data.|Reynold Cheng,Sarvjeet Singh,Sunil Prabhakar","80540|VLDB|2005|PrediCalc A Logical Spreadsheet Management System|Computerized spreadsheets are a great success.

However, since the seller's item descriptions are not structured and do not conform to a standard set of values (think \"Chevy\" versus \"Chevrolet\"), searching and organizing this data is difficult. This paper describes a working demonstration of the Phoebus system which uses both record linkage and information extraction to parse out the meaningful attributes of an item description and assign them standard values. This allows the data to be sorted, searched and linked to other data sources where standard values for the attributes are required to link the sources together.|Matthew Michelson,Craig A.

While digital watermarking is a widely used measure to protect digital data from copyright offences, the complex and flexible construction of XML data poses a number of challenges to digital watermarking, such as re-organization and alteration attacks. To overcome these challenges, the watermarking scheme has to be based on the usability of data and the underlying semantics like key attributes and functional dependencies. In this paper, we describe WmXML, a system for watermarking XML documents. It generates queries from essential semantics to identify the available watermarking bandwidth in XML documents, and integrates query rewriting technique to overcome the threats from data re-organization and alteration. In the demonstration, we will showcase the use of WmXML and its effectiveness in countering various attacks.|Xuan Zhou,HweeHwa Pang,Kian-Lee Tan,Dhruv Mangla"],["80494|VLDB|2005|Adaptive Stream Filters for Entity-based Queries with Non-Value Tolerance|We study the problem of applying adaptive filters for approximate query processing in a distributed stream environment.

In this paper, we cover entity-based queries (e.g., nearest neighbor) with non-value-based error tolerance. We investigate different non-value-based error tolerance definitions and discuss how they are applied to two classes of entity-based queries non-rank-based and rank-based queries.

We present an extensible stream database system that allows scalable and flexible continuous queries on such streams. Application dependent streams and query functions are defined through an object-relational model. Distributed execution plans for continuous queries are described as high-level data flow distribution templates. Using a generic template we define two partitioning strategies for scalable parallel execution of expensive stream queries window split and window distribute. Window split provides operators for parallel execution of query functions by reducing the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluate these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that window split is favorable when expensive queries are executed on limited resources, while window distribution is better otherwise.|Milena Ivanova,Tore Risch","80493|VLDB|2005|Loadstar Load Shedding in Data Stream Mining|In this demo, we show that intelligent load shedding is essential in achieving optimum results in mining data streams under various resource constraints. The Loadstar system introduces load shedding techniques to classifying multiple data streams of large volume and high speed. Loadstar uses a novel metric known as the quality of decision (QoD) to measure the level of uncertainty in classification. Resources are then allocated to sources where uncertainty is high. To make optimum classification decisions and accurate QoD measurement, Loadstar relies on feature prediction to model the data dropped by the load shedding mechanism. Furthermore, Loadstar is able to adapt to the changing data characteristics in data streams. The system thus offers a nice solution to data mining with resource constraints.|Yun Chi,Haixun Wang,Philip S. Yu","80674|VLDB|2006|Safety Guarantee of Continuous Join Queries over Punctuated Data Streams|Continuous join queries (CJQ) are needed for correlating data from multiple streams. One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

When overloaded, the system must shed load in order to maintain low-latency query results. In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

These techniques represent the input in terms broader characteristics and improve efficiency of various applications, e.g., learning, classification, event detection, among many others. In a recent past, the synopsis techniques have gained more currency due to the emerging areas like data stream management.In this tutorial, we propose to revisit algorithms for Wavelet and Histogram synopsis construction. In the recent years, a significant number of papers have appeared which has advanced the state-of-the-art in synopsis construction considerably. In particular, we have seen the development of a large number of efficient algorithms which are also guaranteed to be near optimal. Furthermore, these synopsis construction problems have found deep roots in theory and database systems, and have influenced a wide range of problems. In a different level, a large number of the synopsis construction algorithms use a similar set of techniques. It is extremely valuable to discuss and analyze these techniques, and we expect broader pictures and paradigms to emerge. This would allow us to develop algorithms for newer problems with greater ease. Understanding these recurrent themes and intuition behind the development of these algorithms is one of the main thrusts of the tutorial.Our goal will be to cover a wide spectrum of these topics and make the researchers in VLDB community aware of the new algorithms, optimum or approximate, offline or streaming.
