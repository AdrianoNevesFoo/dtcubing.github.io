In the case of anthrax attack, a delay of hours in making a right decision can lead to hundreds of lives lost. Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision. We present empirical evidence illustrating that the performance of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and timeliness is improved significantly by utilizing POMDPs.|Masoumeh T.

The MAILS framework combines inverse entailment with an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge in a multi-agent setting, facilitating a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates when required.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design.

It is fundamental to automatic tracking, planning, and control of real-world stochastic systems such as robots, programs, and autonomous agents. This paper presents a novel sampling-based filtering algorithm.

It does so by sampling deterministic action sequences and then performing exact filtering on those sequences. These results are promising for applications in stochastic planning, natural language processing, and robot control.|Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Eyal Amir","16294|IJCAI|2005|First-Order Logical Filtering|Logical filtering is the process of updating a belief state (set of possible world states) after a sequence of executed actions and perceived observations. In general, it is intractable in dynamic domains that include many objects and relationships. Still, potential applications for such domains (e.g., semantic web, autonomous agents, and partial-knowledge games) encourage research beyond immediate intractability results.

We sidestep previous discouraging results, and show that our algorithms are exact in many cases of interest. These algorithms accept belief states in full FOL, which allows natural representation with explicit references to unidentified objects, and partially known relationships. Our algorithms keep the encoding compact for important classes of actions, such as STRIPS actions.

Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","57305|GECCO|2005|Extracted global structure makes local building block processing effective in XCS|Michigan-style learning classifier systems (LCSs), such as the accuracy-based XCS system, evolve distributed problem solutions represented by a population of rules.

Exhaustive search is intractable for finding long motifs because the combinatorial growth of the search space is exponential, thus heuristic methods are preferred. In this paper, we propose the Genetic Algorithm with Local Filtering (GALF) to address the problem, which combines and utilizes both position-led and consensus-led representations in present GA approaches. While position-led representation provides flexibility to move around the search space, it is likely to contain some \"false positive\" sites within an individual.

Thus both efficiency and accuracy can be achieved.

McIlraith","66156|AAAI|2007|Counting CSP Solutions Using Generalized XOR Constraints|We present a general framework for determining the number of solutions of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) with a high precision. Our first strategy uses additional binary variables for the CSP, and applies an XOR or parity constraint based method introduced previously for Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. In the CSP framework, in addition to the naive individual filtering of XOR constraints used in SAT, we are able to apply a global domain filtering algorithm by viewing these constraints as a collection of linear equalities over the field of two elements. Our most promising strategy extends this approach further to larger domains, and applies the so-called generalized XOR constraints directly to CSP variables. This allows us to reap the benefits of the compact and structured representation that CSPs offer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our counting framework through experimental comparisons with the solution enumeration approach (which, we believe, is the current best generic solution counting method for CSPs), and with solution counting in the context of SAT and integer programming.|Carla P.

Sequence learning is a fundamental problem, which covers a wide area of research topic including, e.g. handwritten character recognition or speech and natural language processing. For this, one may compute feature vectors from sequence and learn a function in feature space or directly match sequence using methods like dynamic time warping. The former approach is not general in that they rely on sets of application-dependent features, while, in the latter, matching is often inefficient or ineffective. Our method takes the latter approach, while providing a very simple and robust matching.

We consider the inverse problem of detecting the cognitive state of a human subject based on the fMRI data. We have explored classification techniques such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machines. In order to reduce the very high dimensional fMRI data, we have used three feature selection strategies. Discriminating features and activity based features were used to select features for the problem of identifying the instantaneous cognitive state given a single fMRI scan and correlation based features were used when fMRI data from a single time interval was given. A case study of visuo-motor sequence learning is presented. The set of cognitive states we are interested in detecting are whether the subject has learnt a sequence, and if the subject is paying attention only towards the position or towards both the color and position of the visual stimuli. We have successfully used correlation based features to detect position-color related cognitive states with % accuracy and the cognitive states related to learning with .% accuracy.|Vishwajeet Singh,Krishna P.

We analyse under what circumstances a sequence of deals respecting the negotiation topology may be expected to converge to a state where no agent envies any of the agents it is directly connected to. We also analyse the computational complexity of a related decision problem, namely the problem of checking whether a given negotiation state admits any deal that would both be beneficial to every agent involved and reduce envy in the agent society.|Yann Chevaleyre,Ulrich Endriss,Nicolas Maudet","65879|AAAI|2006|Identification of Joint Interventional Distributions in Recursive Semi-Markovian Causal Models|This paper is concerned with estimating the effects of actions from causal assumptions, represented concisely as a directed graph, and statistical knowledge, given as a probability distribution.

The identifiability question asks whether it is possible to compute the probability of some set of (effect) variables given intervention on another set of (intervention) variables, in the presence of non-observable (i.e., hidden or latent) variables. It is well known that the answer to the question depends on the structure of the causal Bayesian network, the set of observable variables, the set of effect variables, and the set of intervention variables. Our work is based on the work of Tian, Pearl, Huang, and Valtorta (Tian & Pearl a b  Huang & Valtorta a) and extends it. We show that the identify algorithm that Tian and Pearl define and prove sound for semi-Markovian models can be transfered to general causal graphs and is not only sound, but also complete.

In fact, we win % more often by beginning with such completely consistent boards and gradually switching (as the game progressed) to boards that are merely consistent with the latest observation. This surprising result is explained by noting that as the game progresses, a board that is consistent with the last move becomes more and more likely to be consistent with the entire set of observations, even if we have no idea what sequence of moves might have actually generated this board.|Austin Parker,Dana S.

There is a large volume of work concerned with classical beliefrevision, the primary issue of which is the mitigation of the uncertainty inherent in environments in which belief revision is necessary. Traditional approaches attempt to assess the explanatory power of beliefs and utilize this as a heuristic to resolve this ambiguity.

It is therefore not surprising that the term 'theory revision' is used to describe this process Ourston and Mooney, .

Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme. The proposed scheme reduces Pareto-size and the appropriate number of clusters can usually be determined.|Nobukazu Matake,Tomoyuki Hiroyasu,Mitsunori Miki,Tomoharu Senda","66210|AAAI|2007|Approximating OWL-DL Ontologies|Efficient query answering over ontologies is one of the most useful and important services to support Semantic Web applications.

It is fundamental to automatic tracking, planning, and control of real-world stochastic systems such as robots, programs, and autonomous agents. This paper presents a novel sampling-based filtering algorithm. Its expected error is smaller than sequential Monte Carlo sampling techniques given a fixed number of samples, as we prove and show empirically. It does so by sampling deterministic action sequences and then performing exact filtering on those sequences.

Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

When the decision maker wants to choose the most adequate strategy for its environment, there is a need to control the proposed evolutionary solving approach, due to the complexity of the model.

Even though the distribution induced by a Markov network corresponds to ratios of multi-linear functions, whereas the distribution induced by a Bayesian network corresponds to multi-linear functions, the results we obtain for Markov networks are as effective computationally as those obtained for Bayesian networks. This similarity is due to the fact that conditional probabilities have the same functional form in both Bayesian and Markov networks, which turns out to be the more influential factor. The major difference we found, however, is in how changes in parameter values should be quantified, as such parameters are interpreted differently in Bayesian networks and Markov networks.|Hei Chan,Adnan Darwiche","16509|IJCAI|2007|Adaptation of Organizational Models for Multi-Agent Systems Based on Max Flow Networks|Organizational models within multi-agent systems literature are of a static nature.

First, a formal mapping between a well-known organizational modeling framework and max flow networks is presented. Having such a mapping maintains the insightful structure of an organizational model whereas specifying efficient adaptation algorithms based on max flow networks can be done as well.

Performance on a job-shop scheduling problem is evaluated empirically with and without gene libraries, and with many different library configurations. We propose that gene libraries encourage diversity in a population of solutions and that the number of components in the gene library parameterises this effect. The number of gene libraries used is found to affect solution fitness and indeed using larger numbers of libraries (and therefore libraries of smaller components) enables higher fitness to be attained. We conclude that gene libraries are likely to be of use in applications where there is a need to maintain the diversity of solutions.|Peter Spellward,Tim Kovacs","58223|GECCO|2007|Modelling danger and anergy in artificial immune systems|Artificial Immune Systems are engineering systems which have been inspired from the functioning of the biological immune system.

The first, anergy, has been subject to the intense focus of immunologists as a possible key to autoimmune disease. The second is danger theory, which has attracted much interest as a possible alternative to traditional self-nonself selection models.We adopt a published immunological model, validate and extend it. Using the same calculations and assumptions as the original model, we integrate danger theory into the software.Without anergy, both models - the original and the danger model - produce similar results. When anergy is added, both models' performance improves. However, there seems to be some synergy between the mechanisms anergy has a greater effect on the danger model than the original model.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16248|IJCAI|2005|Algebraic Markov Decision Processes|In this paper, we provide an algebraic approach to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which allows a unified treatment of MDPs and includes many existing models (quantitative or qualitative) as particular cases.

We recast the problem of finding an optimal policy at a finite horizon as an algebraic path problem in a decision rule graph where arcs are valued by functions, which justifies the use of the Jacobi algorithm to solve algebraic Bellman equations. In order to show the potential of this general approach, we exhibit new variations of MDPs, admitting complete or partial preference structures, as well as probabilistic or possibilistic representation of uncertainty.|Patrice Perny,Olivier Spanjaard,Paul Weng","16409|IJCAI|2007|Topological Value Iteration Algorithm for Markov Decision Processes|Value Iteration is an inefficient algorithm for Markov decision processes (MDPs) because it puts the majority of its effort into backing up the entire state space, which turns out to be unnecessary in many cases.

All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space.

In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model.

In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process.

Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability.

We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies. The result is an ecology in which the representations are species.|James A. R.

These risks are normally mitigated by using a soft margin criterion, such as hinge loss, to reduce outlier sensitivity. In this paper, we present a more direct approach that explicitly incorporates outlier suppression in the training process. In particular, we show how outlier detection can be encoded in the large margin training principle of support vector machines. By expressing a convex relaxation of the joint training problem as a semide finite program, one can use this approach to robustly train a support vector machine while suppressing outliers. We demonstrate that our approach can yield superior results to the standard soft margin approach in the presence of outliers.|Linli Xu,Koby Crammer,Dale Schuurmans"],["16373|IJCAI|2007|Learning User Clicks in Web Search|Machine learning for predicting user clicks in Web-based search offers automated explanation of user activity.

For example, in research paper author name resolution, even clever use of venue, title and coauthorship relations are often not enough to make a confident coreference decision. This paper presents several methods for increasing accuracy by gathering and integrating additional evidence from the web. We formulate the coreference problem as one of graph partitioning with discriminatively-trained edge weights, and then incorporate web information either as additional features or as additional nodes in the graph. Since the web is too large to incorporate all its data, we need an efficient procedure for selecting a subset of web queries and data. We formally describe the problem of resource bounded information gathering in each of these contexts, and show significant accuracy improvement with low cost.|Pallika Kanani,Andrew McCallum,Chris Pal","65756|AAAI|2006|Using Semantic Web Technologies for Policy Management on the Web|With policy management becoming popular as a means of providing flexible Web security, the number of policy languages being proposed for the Web is constantly increasing. We recognize the importance of policies for securing the Web and believe that the future will only bring more policy languages. We do not, however, believe that users should be forced to conform the description of their policy relationships to a single standard policy language. Instead there should be a way of encompassing different policy languages and supporting heterogeneous policy systems. As a step in this direction, we propose Rein, a policy framework grounded in Semantic Web technologies, which leverages the distributed nature and linkability of the Web to provide Web-based policy management. Rein provides ontologies for describing policy domains in a decentralized manner and provides an engine for reasoning over these descriptions, both of which can be used to develop domain and policy language specific security systems. We describe the Rein policy framework and discuss how a Rein policy management systems can be developed for access control in an online photo sharing application.|Lalana Kagal,Tim Berners-Lee,Dan Connolly,Daniel J.

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a ,, Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of % on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly.

To provide a natural and satisfying formalization of these attitudes is a longstanding problem in the community of agent theory. Most of existing modal logic approaches are based on Kripke structures and have to face the so-called side-effect problem. This paper presents a new modal logic formalizing agents' pro attitudes, based on neighborhood models. There are three distinguishing features of this logic. Firstly, this logic naturally satisfies Bratman's requirements for agents' beliefs and pro attitudes, as well as some interesting properties that have not been discussed before. Secondly, we give a sound and complete axiom system for characterizing all the valid properties of beliefs and pro attitudes. We introduce for the first time the notion of linear neighborhood frame for obtaining the semantic model, and this brings a new member to the family of non-normal modal logics. Finally, we argue that the present logic satisfies an important requirement proposed from the viewpoint of computation, that is, computational grounding, which means that properties in this logic can be given an interpretation in terms of some concrete computational model. Indeed, the presented neighborhood frame can be naturally derived from probabilistic programming with utilities.|Kaile Su,Abdul Sattar,Han Lin,Mark Reynolds","66179|AAAI|2007|Probabilistic Modal Logic|A modal logic is any logic for handling modalities concepts like possibility, necessity, and knowledge.

We provide an exact algorithm which takes a probabilistic Kripke stntcture and answers probabilistic modal queries in polynomial-time in the size of the model. Then, we introduce an approximate method for applications in which we have very many or infinitely many states.

It provides a way for compiling a stratified belief base in order to be able to process inference from it in polynomial time. The resulting extra compilation cost is very low.

In contrast to GA's, PC-based methods do not update populations of solutions. Instead they update an explicitly parameterized probability distribution p over the space of solutions. That updating of p arises as the optimization of a functional of p. The functional is chosen so that any p that optimizes it should be p peaked about good solutions. The PC approach has deep connections with both game theory and statistical physics. We review the PC approach using its motivation as the information theoretic formulation of bounded rationality for multi-agent systems (MAS). It is then compared with GA's on a diverse set of problems. To handle high dimensional surfaces, in the PC method investigated here p is restricted to a product distribution. Each distribution in that product is controlled by a separate agent. The test functions were selected for their difficulty using either traditional gradient descent or genetic algorithms. On those functions the PC-based approach significantly outperforms traditional GA's in both rate of descent, trapping in false minima, and long term optimization.|Chien-Feng Huang,Stefan Bieniawski,David H.

Logistics networks can be seen as a distributed system that have to adapt to requirements of companies and customers in a flexible and fast manner. When constructing and planning logistic networks different aspects of complexity have to be considered the number of stores, intermediate stores and transport entities that are required at every stage in a supply chain as well as the sufficient size of every store or transport entity. This paper presents an approach that simulates adaptive logistic networks using a multi-agent system (MAS) based on Evolutionary Computation (EC). Our approach uses fully decentralized operators for reproduction like mutation, recombination and selection, regulated by market mechanisms. The novelty of this approach lies in the decentralized bottom-up adaption method for decentralized systems and we use a logistic scenario as an example.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to provide the optimal solution, however such method fails when the state space and action space are huge. We apply a form of NeuroEvolution (NE) algorithm to inductively learn the CAC policies, which is called CN (Call Admission Control scheme using NE). Comparing with the Q-Learning based CAC scheme in the constant traffic load shows that CN can not only approximate the optimal solution very well but also optimize the CBR and CDR in a more flexibility way. Additionally the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of keeping the handoff dropping rate below a pre-specified value while still maintaining an acceptable CBR in the presence of smoothly varying arrival rates of traffic, in which the state space is too large for practical deployment of the other learning scheme.|Xu Yang,John Bigham","57760|GECCO|2006|Coevolution of neural networks using a layered pareto archive|The Layered Pareto Coevolution Archive (LAPCA) was recently proposed as an effective Coevolutionary Memory (CM) which, under certain assumptions, approximates monotonic progress in coevolution.
