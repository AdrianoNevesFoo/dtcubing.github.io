Although support vector machines (SVMs) have been a dominant machine learning technique for the past decade, they have generally been applied to supervised learning problems. Developing unsupervised extensions to SVMs has in fact proved to be difficult. In this paper, we present a principled approach to unsupervised SVM training by formulating convex relaxations of the natural training criterion find a labeling that would yield an optimal SVM classifier on the resulting training data. The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well. While previous work has concentrated on the two-class case, we present a general, multi-class formulation that can be applied to a wider range of natural data sets. The resulting training procedures are computationally intensive, but produce high quality generalization results.|Linli Xu,Dale Schuurmans","57321|GECCO|2005|Finding needles in haystacks is harder with neutrality|This research presents an analysis of the reported successes of the Cartesian Genetic Programming method on a simplified form of the Boolean parity problem.

We implement a simple intron free random sampling algorithm which performs considerably better on the same problem and then explain how such performance is possible.|M. Collins","57375|GECCO|2005|Applying both positive and negative selection to supervised learning for anomaly detection|This paper presents a novel approach of applying both positive selection and negative selection to supervised learning for anomaly detection. It first learns the patterns of the normal class via co-evolutionary genetic algorithm, which is inspired from the positive selection, and then generates synthetic samples of the anomaly class, which is based on the negative selection in the immune system. Two algorithms about synthetic generation of the anomaly class are proposed. One deals with data sets containing a few anomalous samples while the other deals with data sets containing no anomalous samples at all. The experimental results on some benchmark data sets from UCI data set repertory show that the detection rate is improved evidently, accompanied by a slight increase in false alarm rate via introducing novel synthetic samples of the anomaly class. The advantages of our method are the increased ability of classifiers in identifying both previously known and innovative anomalies, and the maximal degradation of overfitting phenomenon.|Xiaoshu Hang,Honghua Dai","57849|GECCO|2006|Embedded cartesian genetic programming and the lawnmower and hierarchical-if-and-only-if problems|Embedded Cartesian Genetic Programming (ECGP) is an extension of the directed graph based Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP), which is capable of automatically acquiring, evolving and re-using partial solutions in the form of modules.

In this paper, we introduce for the first time a new multi-chromosome approach to CGP and ECGP that allows difficult problems with multiple outputs to be broken down into many smaller, simpler problems with single outputs, whilst still encoding the entire solution in a single genotype. We also propose a multi-chromosome evolutionary strategy which selects the best chromosomes from the entire population to form the new fittest individual, which may not have been present in the population. The multi-chromosome approach to CGP and ECGP is tested on a number of multiple output digital circuits. Computational Effort figures are calculated for each problem and compared against those for CGP and ECGP. The results indicate that the use of multiple chromosomes in both CGP and ECGP provide a significant performance increase on all problems tested.|James Alfred Walker,Julian Francis Miller,Rachel Cavill","57855|GECCO|2006|On-line evolutionary computation for reinforcement learning in stochastic domains|In reinforcement learning, an agent interacting with its environment strives to learn a policy that specifies, for each state it may encounter, what action to take. Evolutionary computation is one of the most promising approaches to reinforcement learning but its success is largely restricted to off-line scenarios. In on-line scenarios, an agent must strive to maximize the reward it accrues while it is learning. Temporal difference (TD) methods, another approach to reinforcement learning, naturally excel in on-line scenarios because they have selection mechanisms for balancing the need to search for better policies exploration) with the need to accrue maximal reward (exploitation). This paper presents a novel way to strike this balance in evolutionary methods by borrowing the selection mechanisms used by TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolution to choose policies for evaluation. Empirical results in the mountain car and server job scheduling domains demonstrate that these techniques can substantially improve evolution's on-line performance in stochastic domains.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone","65884|AAAI|2006|Learning Partially Observable Action Schemas|We present an algorithm that derives actions' effects and preconditions in partially observable, relational domains. Our algorithm has two unique features an expressive relational language, and an exact tractable computation. An action-schema language that we present permits learning of preconditions and effects that include implicit objects and unstated relationships between objects. For example, we can learn that replacing a blown fuse turns on all the lights whose switch is set to on. The algorithm maintains and outputs a relational-logical representation of all possible action-schema models after a sequence of executed actions and partial observations. Importantly, our algorithm takes polynomial time in the number of time steps and predicates. Time dependence on other domain parameters varies with the action-schema language. Our experiments show that the relational structure speeds up both learning and generalization, and outperforms propositional learning methods. It also allows establishing apriori-unknown connections between objects (e.g. light bulbs and their switches), and permits learning conditional effects in realistic and complex situations. Our algorithm takes advantage of a DAG structure that can be updated efficiently and preserves compactness of representation.|Dafna Shahaf,Eyal Amir","57353|GECCO|2005|Preventing overfitting in GP with canary functions|Overfitting is a fundamental problem of most machine learning techniques, including genetic programming (GP).

This paper presents a simple scheme for implementing canary functions using cross-validation. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated by applying it to the numeric regression problem. A list of conditions and criteria for applying this technique to other problem domains is also identified. Other strategies for dealing with overfitting in GP are discussed.|Nate Foreman,Matthew P.

The algorithms perform exact learning of preconditions and effects in any deterministic action domain. This includes STRIPS actions and actions with conditional effects. In contrast, previous algorithms rely on approximations to achieve tractability, and do not supply approximation guarantees. Our algorithms take time and space that are polynomial in the number of domain features, and can maintain a representation that stays compact indefinitely. Our experimental results show that we can learn efficiently and practically in domains that contain over 's of features (more than  states).|Dafna Shahaf,Allen Chang,Eyal Amir","57561|GECCO|2005|Investigating the performance of module acquisition in cartesian genetic programming|Embedded Cartesian Genetic Programming (ECGP) is a form of the graph based Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) in which modules are automatically acquired and evolved.

One important voting rule is the Slater rule. It selects a ranking of the alternatives (or candidates) to minimize the number of pairs of candidates such that the ranking disagrees with the pairwise majority vote on these two candidates. The use of the Slater rule has been hindered by a lack of techniques to compute Slater rankings. In this paper, we show how we can decompose the Slater problem into smaller subproblems if there is a set of similar candidates. We show that this technique suffices to compute a Slater ranking in linear time if the pairwise majority graph is hierarchically structured. For the general case, we also give an efficient algorithm for finding a set of similar candidates. We provide experimental results that show that this technique significantly (sometimes drastically) speeds up search algorithms, Finally, we also use the technique of similar sets to show that computing an optimal Slater ranking is NP-hard. even in the absence of pairwise ties.|Vincent Conitzer","65757|AAAI|2006|Diagnosis of Multi-Robot Coordination Failures Using Distributed CSP Algorithms|With increasing deployment of systems involving multiple coordinating agents, there is a growing need for diagnosing coordination failures in such systems. Previous work presented centralized methods for coordination failure diagnosis however, these are not always applicable, due to the significant computational and communication requirements, and the brittleness of a single point of failure. In this paper we propose a distributed approach to model-based coordination failure diagnosis. We model the coordination between the agents as a constraint graph, and adapt several algorithms from the distributed CSP area, to use as the basis for the diagnosis algorithms. We evaluate the algorithms in extensive experiments with simulated and real Sony Aibo robots and show that in general a trade-off exists between the computational requirements of the algorithms, and their diagnosis results. Surprisingly, in contrast to results in distributed CSPs, the asynchronous backtracking algorithm outperforms stochastic local search in terms of both quality and runtime.|Meir Kalech,Gal A.

The agents need to ensure that the service providers they select are trustworthy. Because the agents are autonomous and there is no central trusted authority, the agents help each other determine the trustworthiness of the service providers they are interested in. This help is rendered via a series of referrals to other agents, culminating in zero or more trustworthy service providers being identified. A trust network is a multiagent system where each agent potentially rates the trustworthiness of another agent. This paper develops a formal treatment of trust networks. At the base is a recently proposed representation of trust via a probability certainty distribution. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of two operators, concatenation and aggregation, using which trust ratings can be combined in a trust network. This paper motivates and establishes some important properties regarding these operators, thereby ensuring that trust can be combined correctly. Further, it shows that effects of malicious agents, who give incorrect information, are limited.|Yonghong Wang,Munindar P.

When the set of agents and the set of alternatives coincide, we get the ranking systems setting. A famous type of ranking systems are page ranking systems in the context of search engines. Such ranking systems do not exist in empty space, and therefore agents' incentives should be carefully considered. In this paper we define three measures for quantifying the incentive compatibility of ranking systems. We apply these measures to several known ranking systems, such as PageRank, and prove tight bounds on the level of incentive compatibility under two basic properties strong monotonicity and non-imposition. We also introduce two novel nonimposing ranking systems, one general, and the other for the case of systems with three participants. A full axiomatization is provided for the latter.|Alon Altman,Moshe Tennenholtz","65442|AAAI|2005|Anyone but Him The Complexity of Precluding an Alternative|Preference aggregation in a multiagent setting is a central issue in both human and computer contexts. In this paper, we study in terms of complexity the vulnerability of preference aggregation to destructive control. That is, we study the ability of an election's chair to, through such mechanisms as votercandidate additionsuppressionpartition, ensure that a particular candidate (equivalently, alternative) does not win. And we study the extent to which election systems can make it impossible, or computationally costly (NP-complete), for the chair to execute such control. Among the systems we study--plurality, Condorcet, and approval voting--we find cases where systems immune or computationally resistant to a chair choosing the winner nonetheless are vulnerable to the chair blocking a victory. Beyond that, we see that among our studied systems no one system offers the best protection against destructive control. Rather, the choice of a preference aggregation system will depend closely on which types of control one wishes to be protected against. We also find concrete cases where the complexity of or susceptibility to control varies dramatically based on the choice among natural tie-handling rules.|Edith Hemaspaandra,Lane A.

Examples of such large-scale, networked multi-agent systems include peer-to-peer networks, distributed information retrieval, and agent-based supply chains. One way of dealing with the uncertain and dynamic nature of such environments is to endow agents with the ability to modify the agent social network by autonomously adapting their local connectivity structure. In this paper, we present a framework for agent-organized networks (AONs) in the context of multi-agent production and exchange, and experimentally evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of specific AON strategies. We find that decentralized network adaptation can significantly improve organizational performance. Additionally, we analyze several properties of the resulting network structures and consider their relationship to the observed increase in organizational performance.|Matthew E.

The restriction of communication to neighboring hosts makes determining the global state especially difficult, if not impractical. This paper addresses the problem of coordinating the positions of an arbitrary number of services, encapsulated by mobile agents, in a dynamic peer-to-peer network. The agents' collective goal is to minimize the distance between hosts and services, even if the topology is changing constantly. We propose a distributed algorithm to efficiently calculate the stationary distribution of the network. This can be used as a hill climbing heuristic for agents to find near-optimal locations at which to provide services. Finally, we show that the agent-based hill climbing approach is temporally-stable relative to the instantaneous optimum.|Evan Sultanik,William C.

In this paper we introduce Mosaic World, an artificial life model that maintains the essential characteristics of natural visual ecologies, and which is populated by virtual agents that - through 'natural' selection - come to resolve stimulus ambiguity by adapting the functional structure of their visual networks according to the statistical structure of their ecological experience. Mosaic World therefore presents us with an important tool for exploring the computational principles by which vision can overcome stimulus ambiguity and usefully guide behaviour.|Ehud Schlessinger,Peter J.

Unfortunately, Kemeny rankings are NP-hard to compute. Recent work on computing Kemeny rankings has focused on producing good bounds to use in search-based methods.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.|Vincent Conitzer,Tuomas Sandholm"],["57678|GECCO|2006|Exploring network topology evolution through evolutionary computations|We present an evolutionary methodology that explores the evolution of network topology when a uniform growth of the network traffic is considered.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa"],["65433|AAAI|2005|Extending Continuous Time Bayesian Networks|Continuous-time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) (Nodelman, Shelton, & Koller  ), are an elegant modeling language for structured stochastic processes that evolve over continuous time.

The second extension is a general method for reasoning about negative evidence, by introducing updates that assert no observable events occur over an interval of time. Such updates were not defined in the original CTBN framework, and we show that their inclusion can significantly improve the accuracy of filtering and prediction.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times.

We focus, primarily, on the execution of phase-dependent policies. Phases are introduced into a model to represent relevant execution history, but there is no physical manifestation of phases in the real world. We treat phases as partially observable state features and show how a belief distribution over phase configurations can be derived from observable state features through the use of transient analysis for Markov chains. This results in an efficient method for phase tracking during execution that can be combined with the QMDP value method for POMDPs to make action choices. We also discuss, briefly, how the structure of MDPs with phase transitions can be exploited in structured value iteration with symbolic representation of vectors and matrices.|Håkan L. S.

Existing approaches that solve Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) suffer from the fact that they can only solve relatively small problems without complex constraints on task execution. OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings. Experimental results are shown to support our claims.|Aurélie Beynier,Abdel-Illah Mouaddib","65864|AAAI|2006|Targeting Specific Distributions of Trajectories in MDPs|We define TTD-MDPs, a novel class of Markov decision processes where the traditional goal of an agent is changed from finding an optimal trajectory through a state space to realizing a specified distribution of trajectories through the space.

First, credit must be assigned for an action taken at time step t that results in a reward at time step t  t. Second, credit must be assigned for the contribution of agent i to the overall system performance. The first credit assignment problem is typically addressed with temporal difference methods such as Q-learning.

To address both credit assignment problems simultaneously, we propose the \"Q Updates with Immediate Counterfactual Rewards-learning\" (QUICR-learning) designed to improve both the convergence properties and performance of Q-learning in large multi-agent problems. QUICR-learning is based on previous work on single-time-step counterfactual rewards described by the collectives framework. Results on a traffic congestion problem shows that QUICR-learning is significantly better than a Q-learner using collectives-based (single-time-step counterfactual) rewards. In addition QUICR-learning provides significant gains over conventional and local Q-learning. Additional results on a multi-agent grid-world problem show that the improvements due to QUICR-learning are not domain specific and can provide up to a ten fold increase in performance over existing methods.|Adrian K.

We compare learning on a complex task with three function approximators, a CMAC, a neural network, and an RBF, and demonstrate that behavior transfer works well with all three.

In practice, the success of function approximators depends on the ability of the human designer to select an appropriate representation for the value function. A recently developed approach called evolutionary function approximation uses evolutionary computation to automate the search for effective representations. While this approach can substantially improve the performance of TD methods, it requires many sample episodes to do so. We present an enhancement to evolutionary function approximation that makes it much more sample-efficient by exploiting the off-policy nature of certain TD methods. Empirical results in a server job scheduling domain demonstrate that the enhanced method can learn better policies than evolution or TD methods alone and can do so in many fewer episodes than standard evolutionary function approximation.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone","57363|GECCO|2005|Co-evolving recurrent neurons learn deep memory POMDPs|Recurrent neural networks are theoretically capable of learning complex temporal sequences, but training them through gradient-descent is too slow and unstable for practical use in reinforcement learning environments.

Evolutionary computation is one of the most promising approaches to reinforcement learning but its success is largely restricted to off-line scenarios. In on-line scenarios, an agent must strive to maximize the reward it accrues while it is learning. Temporal difference (TD) methods, another approach to reinforcement learning, naturally excel in on-line scenarios because they have selection mechanisms for balancing the need to search for better policies exploration) with the need to accrue maximal reward (exploitation). This paper presents a novel way to strike this balance in evolutionary methods by borrowing the selection mechanisms used by TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolution to choose policies for evaluation. Empirical results in the mountain car and server job scheduling domains demonstrate that these techniques can substantially improve evolution's on-line performance in stochastic domains.|Shimon Whiteson,Peter Stone","65600|AAAI|2005|Improving Reinforcement Learning Function Approximators via Neuroevolution|Reinforcement learning problems are commonly tackled with temporal difference methods, which use dynamic programming and statistical sampling to estimate the long-term value of taking each action in each state.

Large action sets, however, have received considerably less attention. This paper demonstrates the use of knowledge transfer between related tasks to accelerate learning with large action sets. We introduce action transfer, a technique that extracts the actions from the (near-)optimal solution to the first task and uses them in place of the full action set when learning any subsequent tasks. When optimal actions make up a small fraction of the domain's action set, action transfer can substantially reduce the number of actions and thus the complexity of the problem. However, action transfer between dissimilar tasks can be detrimental. To address this difficulty, we contribute randomized task perturbation (RTP), an enhancement to action transfer that makes it robust to unrepresentative source tasks. We motivate RTP action transfer with a detailed theoretical analysis featuring a formalism of related tasks and a bound on the suboptimality of action transfer. The empirical results in this paper show the potential of RTP action transfer to substantially expand the applicability of RL to problems with large action sets.|Alexander A.

Another important consequence of this paradigm change is a method which segments the Pareto sets produced by our approach.

Among the methods proposed are Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE), Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) and Local Discriminant Embedding (LDE) which have been used in such applications as face recognition and imagevideo retrieval. However, although the data in these applications are more naturally represented as higher-order tensors, the embedding methods can only work with vectorized data representations which may not capture well some useful information in the original data. Moreover, high-dimensional vectorized representations also suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the high computational demand. In this paper, we propose some novel tensor embedding methods which, unlike previous methods, take data directly in the form of tensors of arbitrary order as input. These methods allow the relationships between dimensions of a tensor representation to be efficiently characterized. Moreover, they also allow the intrinsic local geometric and topological properties of the manifold embedded in a tensor space to be naturally estimated. Furthermore, they do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the high computational demand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tensor embedding methods on a face recognition application and compare them with some previous methods.

This is particularly expensive to obtain for structured prediction tasks, where each training instance may have multiple, interacting labels, all of which must be correctly annotated for the instance to be of use to the learner. Traditional active learning addresses this problem by optimizing the order in which the examples are labeled to increase learning efficiency. However, this approach does not consider the difficulty of labeling each example, which can vary widely in structured prediction tasks. For example, the labeling predicted by a partially trained system may be easier to correct for some instances than for others. We propose a new active learning paradigm which reduces not only how many instances the annotator must label, but also how difficult each instance is to annotate. The system also leverages information from partially correct predictions to efficiently solicit annotations from the user.

This is achieved by leveraging recent advances in compilation of Bayesian networks into arithmetic circuits, which can circumvent treewidth-imposed limits by exploiting the local structure present in the network. Specifically, we implement a branch-and-bound search where the bounds are computed using linear-time operations on the compiled arithmetic circuit. On networks with local structure, we observe orders-of-magnitude improvements over the algorithm of Park and Darwiche. In particular, we are able to efficiently solve many problems where the latter algorithm runs out of memory because of high treewidth.|Jinbo Huang,Mark Chavira,Adnan Darwiche","65832|AAAI|2006|Probabilistic Goal Recognition in Interactive Narrative Environments|Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in interactive narrative-centered virtual environments for education, training, and entertainment. Narrative environments dynamically craft engaging story-based experiences for users, who are themselves active participants in unfolding stories. A key challenge posed by interactive narrative is recognizing users' goals so that narrative planners can dynamically orchestrate plot elements and character actions to create rich, customized stories. In this paper we present an inductive approach to predicting users' goals by learning probabilistic goal recognition models. This approach has been evaluated in a narrative environment for the domain of microbiology in which the user plays the role of a medical detective solving a science mystery. An empirical evaluation of goal recognition based on n-gram models and Bayesian networks suggests that the models offer significant predictive power.|Bradford W. Mott,Sunyoung Lee,James C.

Creating such warning systems by hand, however, is a difficult and time-consuming task. This paper describes three advances toward evolving neural networks with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to warn about such crashes in real-world environments. First, NEAT was evaluated in a complex, dynamic simulation with other cars, where it outperformed three hand-coded strawman warning policies and generated warning levels comparable with those of an open-road warning system. Second, warning networks were trained using raw pixel data from a simulated camera. Surprisingly, NEAT was able to generate warning networks that performed similarly to those trained with higher-level input and still outperformed the baseline hand-coded warning policies. Third, the NEAT approach was evaluated in the real world using a robotic vehicle testbed. Despite noisy and ambiguous sensor data, NEAT successfully evolved warning networks using both laser rangefinders and visual sensors. The results in this paper set the stage for developing warning networks for real-world traffic, which may someday save lives in real vehicles.|Nate Kohl,Kenneth O.

Artificial intelligence algorithms offer the capability to improve the performance or sensor networks in dynamic environments by minimizing energy utilization while not compromising overall performance.

We empirically evaluate the performance of these algorithms within a generic model of a multi-sensor network performing wide area surveillance. These results show that the polynomial algorithm typically generated solutions much closer to the optimal than the theoretical bound, and prove the effectiveness of our pruning procedure.|Viet Dung Dang,Rajdeep K.

The aim is twofold () to allow infeasible solutions with a promising value of the objective function to remain in the population and also () to increase the probabilities of an individual to generate a better offspring while promoting collaboration of all the population to generate better solutions. These goals are achieved by allowing each parent to generate more than one offspring. The best offspring is selected using a comparison mechanism based on feasibility and this child is compared against its parent. To maintain diversity, the proposed approach uses a mechanism successfully adopted with other evolutionary algorithms where, based on a parameter Sr a solution (between the best offspring and the current parent) with a better value of the objective function can remain in the population, regardless of its feasibility. The proposed approach is validated using test functions from a well-known benchmark commonly adopted to validate constraint-handling techniques used with evolutionary algorithms. The statistical results obtained by the proposed approach are highly competitive (based on quality, robustness and number of evaluations of the objective function) with respect to other constraint-handling techniques, either based on differential evolution or on other evolutionary algorithms, that are representative of the state-of-the-art in the area.

Crossover at the sites of certain classes of intron cannot produce a different fitness in the offspring, but the cost of identifying such sites may be high. We have therefore focused our attention on one particular class of non-contributory node that can be easily identified without sophisticated analysis. Experimentation shows that, for certain problem types, the presence of such dormant nodes can be extensive. We have therefore devised a technique that can use this information to reduce the number of fitness evaluations performed, leading to substantial savings in execution time without affecting the results obtained.|David Jackson","65538|AAAI|2005|SAT-Based versus CSP-Based Constraint Weighting for Satisfiability|Recent research has focused on bridging the gap between the satisfiability (SAT) and constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) formalisms. One approach has been to develop a many-valued SAT formula (MV-SAT) as an intermediate paradigm between SAT and CSP, and then to translate existing highly efficient SAT solvers to the MV-SAT domain. Experimental results have shown this approach can achieve significant improvements in performance compared with the traditional SAT and CSP approaches. In this paper, we follow a different route, developing SAT solvers that can automatically recognise CSP structure hidden in SAT encodings. This allows us to look more closely at how constraint weighting can be implemented in the SAT and CSP domains. Our experimental results show that a SAT-based approach to handle weights, together with CSP-based approach to variable instantiation, is superior to other combinations of SAT and CSP-based approaches. A further experiment on the round robin scheduling problem indicates that this many-valued constraint weighting approach outperforms other state-of-the-art solvers.|Duc Nghia Pham,John Thornton,Abdul Sattar,Abdelraouf Ishtaiwi","65441|AAAI|2005|Finding Diverse and Similar Solutions in Constraint Programming|It is useful in a wide range of situations to find solutions which are diverse (or similar) to each other.

Graph decomposition exploits the problem structure and offers space and time complexity bounds while hard information propagation provides practical improvements of space and time behavior inside these theoretical bounds. Concurrently, the extension of local consistency to weighted constraint networks has led to important improvements in branch and bound based solvers. Indeed, soft local consistencies give incrementally computed strong lower bounds providing inexpensive yet powerful pruning and better informed heuristics. In this paper, we consider combinations of tree decomposition based approaches and soft local consistency enforcing for solving weighted constraint problems. The intricacy of weighted information processing leads to different approaches, with different theoretical properties. It appears that the most promising combination sacrifices a bit of theory for improved practical efficiency.|Simon de Givry,Thomas Schiex,Gérard Verfaillie","57285|GECCO|2005|Towards an analysis of dynamic environments|Although the interest in nature-inspired optimization of dynamic problems has been growing constantly over the past decade, very little has been done to analyze and characterize a changing fitness landscape.

When only basic skills are available to the player the fitness landscape is very flat, containing only a few thin peaks. As more human expertise is injected via hand-coded skills or a composite fitness function, more gradient information becomes apparent on the landscape and the genetic search is more successful.

Their major advantage lies in the fact that they are relatively simple to implement while they allow generalizations for a wide range of real world problems. The multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP), which belongs to the class of NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, is one of the variations of the knapsack problem. The MKP has a wide range of real world applications such as cargo loading, selecting projects to fund, budget management, cutting stock, etc. The MKP has been studied quite extensively in the EA community. Due to the constrained nature of the problem, constraint handling techniques gain great importance in the performance of the proposed EA approaches. In this study, the applicability of a generational EA that uses a penalty-based constraint handling technique and a gene locus based, asymmetric, adaptive mutation scheme is explored for the MKP. The effects of the parameters of the explored approach is determined through tests. Further experiments, using large MKP instances from commonly used benchmarks available through the Internet are performed. Comparison tables are given for the performance of the explored approach and other good performing EAs found in literature for the MKP. Results show that performance improves greatly when compared with other penalty-based techniques, but the explored approach is still not the best performer among all. However, unlike the explored technique, the EAs using the other constraint handling techniques require a great amount of extra computational effort and need heuristic information specific to the optimization problem. Based on these observations, and the fact that the performance difference between the explored scheme and the better performers is not too high, research on improving the explored approach is still in progress.|Sima Uyar,Gülsen Eryigit","57653|GECCO|2006|Evolutionary design of pseudorandom sequence generators based on cellular automata and its applicability in current cryptosystems|In this work, a genetic algorithm is used to find cellular automata rules that make cellular automata behave like good pseudorandom sequence generators.

This operator, unlike other recent LCS approaches of smart recombination, does not learn the structure of the domain, but it merges the rules of N parents (N  ) to generate a new offspring. This merge process uses an heuristic that selects the minimum subset of candidate rules that obtains maximum training accuracy. Moreover the operator also includes a rule pruning scheme to avoid the inclusion of over-specific rules, and to guarantee as much as possible the robust behaviour of the LCS. This operator takes advantage from the fact that each individual in a Pittsburgh LCS is a complete solution, and the system has a global view of the solution space that the proposed rule selection algorithm exploits. We have empirically evaluated this operator using a recent LCS called GAssist. First with the standard LCS benchmark, the  bits multiplexer, and later using  standard real datasets.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time.

As an input the planners take a domain description D in action language AL which allows state constraints (non-stratified axioms), together with a set of CNF formulae describing the initial state, and a set of literals representing the goal. We propose two approximations of the transition diagram T defined by D. Both approximations are deterministic transition functions and can be computed efficiently. Moreover they are sound (and sometimes complete) with respect to T. In its search for a plan, an approximation based planner analyses paths of an approximation instead of that of T. CPApc and CPAph are forward, best first search planners based on this idea. We compare them with two state-of-the-art conformant planners, KACMBP and Conformant-FF (CFF), over benchmarks in the literature, and over two new domains. One has large number of state constraints and another has a high degree of incompleteness. Our planners perform reasonably well in benchmark domains and outperform KACMBP and CFF in the first domain while still working well with the second one. Our experimental result shows that having an integral part of a conformant planner to deal with state constraints directly can significantly improve its performance extending a similar claim for classical planners in (Thiebaux.

The problem of planning with TEGs is of renewed interest because it is at the core of planning with temporal preferences. Currently, the fastest domain-independent classical planners employ some kind of heuristic search. However, existing planners for TEGs are not heuristic and are only able to prune the search space by progressing the TEG. In this paper we propose a method for planning with TEGs using heuristic search. We represent TEGs using a rich and compelling subset of a first-order linear temporal logic. We translate a planning problem with TEGs to a classical planning problem. With this translation in hand, we exploit heuristic search to determine a plan. Our translation relies on the construction of a parameterized nondeterministic finite automaton for the TEG.

The main characteristic feature of the EMO approach is that no a priori information about the decision maker's preference is assumed. The EMO approach tries to find well-distributed trade-off solutions with a wide range of objective values as many as possible. A final solution is supposed to be chosen from the obtained trade-off solutions by the decision maker. On the other hand, the reference solution-based approach utilizes the information about the decision maker's preference in the form of a reference solution. We examine whether the EMO approach can find good trade-off solutions close to an arbitrarily given reference solution. Experimental results show that good solutions are not always obtained by the EMO approach. We also examine where the reference solution-based approach can find many trade-off solutions around the given reference solution. Experimental results show that many trade-off solutions can not be obtained even when an archive population of non-dominated solutions is stored in the reference solution-based approach.

Their major advantage lies in the fact that they are relatively simple to implement while they allow generalizations for a wide range of real world problems. The multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP), which belongs to the class of NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, is one of the variations of the knapsack problem. The MKP has a wide range of real world applications such as cargo loading, selecting projects to fund, budget management, cutting stock, etc. The MKP has been studied quite extensively in the EA community. Due to the constrained nature of the problem, constraint handling techniques gain great importance in the performance of the proposed EA approaches. In this study, the applicability of a generational EA that uses a penalty-based constraint handling technique and a gene locus based, asymmetric, adaptive mutation scheme is explored for the MKP. The effects of the parameters of the explored approach is determined through tests. Further experiments, using large MKP instances from commonly used benchmarks available through the Internet are performed. Comparison tables are given for the performance of the explored approach and other good performing EAs found in literature for the MKP. Results show that performance improves greatly when compared with other penalty-based techniques, but the explored approach is still not the best performer among all. However, unlike the explored technique, the EAs using the other constraint handling techniques require a great amount of extra computational effort and need heuristic information specific to the optimization problem. Based on these observations, and the fact that the performance difference between the explored scheme and the better performers is not too high, research on improving the explored approach is still in progress.|Sima Uyar,Gülsen Eryigit","57653|GECCO|2006|Evolutionary design of pseudorandom sequence generators based on cellular automata and its applicability in current cryptosystems|In this work, a genetic algorithm is used to find cellular automata rules that make cellular automata behave like good pseudorandom sequence generators.

The aim is twofold () to allow infeasible solutions with a promising value of the objective function to remain in the population and also () to increase the probabilities of an individual to generate a better offspring while promoting collaboration of all the population to generate better solutions. These goals are achieved by allowing each parent to generate more than one offspring. The best offspring is selected using a comparison mechanism based on feasibility and this child is compared against its parent. To maintain diversity, the proposed approach uses a mechanism successfully adopted with other evolutionary algorithms where, based on a parameter Sr a solution (between the best offspring and the current parent) with a better value of the objective function can remain in the population, regardless of its feasibility. The proposed approach is validated using test functions from a well-known benchmark commonly adopted to validate constraint-handling techniques used with evolutionary algorithms. The statistical results obtained by the proposed approach are highly competitive (based on quality, robustness and number of evaluations of the objective function) with respect to other constraint-handling techniques, either based on differential evolution or on other evolutionary algorithms, that are representative of the state-of-the-art in the area.

The previous state-of-the-art system achieves temporal preference optimization using a SAT formulation, with its creators attributing its performance to advances in SAT solving techniques. We depart from the SAT encoding and instead introduce the Valued DTP (VDTP). In contrast to the traditional semiring-based formalism that annotates legal tuples of a constraint with preferences, our framework instead assigns elementary costs to the constraints themselves. After proving that the VDTP can express the same set of utilitarian optimal solutions as the DTPP with piecewise-constant preference functions, we develop a method for achieving weighted constraint satisfaction within a meta-CSP search space that has traditionally been used to solve DTPs without preferences. This allows us to directly incorporate several powerful techniques developed in previous decision-based DTP literature. Finally, we present empirical results demonstrating that an implementation of our approach consistently outperforms the SAT-based solver by orders of magnitude.|Michael D. Moffitt,Martha E.

The proposed species-based DE (SDE) is able to locate multiple global optima simultaneously through adaptive formation of multiple species (or subpopulations) in an DE population at each iteration step. Each species functions as an DE by itself. Successive local improvements through species formation can eventually transform into global improvements in identifying multiple global optima. In this study the performance of SDE is compared with another recently proposed DE variant CrowdingDE. The computational complexity of SDE, the effect of population size and species radius on SDE are investigated. SDE is found to be more computationally efficient than CrowdingDE over a number of benchmark multimodal test functions.|Xiaodong Li","57685|GECCO|2006|A new proposal for multi-objective optimization using differential evolution and rough sets theory|This paper presents a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on differential evolution and rough sets theory.

Additionally, the approach also incorporates the concept of pa-dominance to get a good distribution of the solutions retained. The main idea of the approach is to use differential evolution (DE) as our main search engine, trying to translate its good convergence properties exhibited in single-objective optimization to the multi-objective case. Rough sets theory is adopted in a second stage of the search in order to improve the spread of the nondominated solutions that have been found so far.

The CTBN framework is based on homogeneous Markov processes, and defines two distributions with respect to each local variable in the system, given its parents an exponential distribution over when the variable transitions, and a multinomial over what is the next value. In this paper, we present two extensions to the framework that make it more useful in modeling practical applications. The first extension models arbitrary transition time distributions using Erlang-Coxian approximations, while maintaining tractable learning. We show how the censored data problem arises in learning the distribution, and present a solution based on expectation-maximization initialized by the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The second extension is a general method for reasoning about negative evidence, by introducing updates that assert no observable events occur over an interval of time. Such updates were not defined in the original CTBN framework, and we show that their inclusion can significantly improve the accuracy of filtering and prediction.

The identifiability question asks whether it is possible to compute the probability of some set of (effect) variables given intervention on another set of (intervention) variables, in the presence of non-observable (i.e., hidden or latent) variables. It is well known that the answer to the question depends on the structure of the causal Bayesian network, the set of observable variables, the set of effect variables, and the set of intervention variables. Our work is based on the work of Tian, Pearl, Huang, and Valtorta (Tian & Pearl a b  Huang & Valtorta a) and extends it.

The aim of solving such problems is to obtain solutions that in terms of objectives and feasibility are as good as possible and at the same time are least sensitive to the parameter variations. Such solutions are said to be robust optimum solutions. In order to investigate the trade-off between the performance and robustness of optimum solutions, we present a new Robust Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (RMOGA) that optimizes two objectives a fitness value and a robustness index. The fitness value serves as a measure of performance of design solutions with respect to multiple objectives and feasibility of the original optimization problem. The robustness index, which is based on a non-gradient based parameter sensitivity estimation approach, is a measure that quantitatively evaluates the robustness of design solutions. RMOGA does not require a presumed probability distribution of uncontrollable parameters and also does not utilize the gradient information of these parameters. Three distance metrics are used to obtain the robustness index and robust solutions.

This paper concerns applying a DE-based algorithm to training Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks with variables including centres, weights, and widths of RBFs. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps the first step is the initial tuning, which focuses on searching for the center, weight, and width of a one-node RBF network, the second step is the local tuning, which optimizes the three variables of the one-node RBF network --- its centre, weight, and width, and the third step is the global tuning, which optimizes all the parameters of the whole network together. The second step and the third step both use the cycling scheme to find the parameters of RBF network. The Mean Square Error from the desired to actual outputs is applied as the objective function to be minimized. Training the networks is demonstrated by approximating a set of functions, using different strategies of DE. A comparison of the net performances with several approaches reported in the literature is given and shows the resulting network performs better in the tested functions.

It first learns the patterns of the normal class via co-evolutionary genetic algorithm, which is inspired from the positive selection, and then generates synthetic samples of the anomaly class, which is based on the negative selection in the immune system. Two algorithms about synthetic generation of the anomaly class are proposed. One deals with data sets containing a few anomalous samples while the other deals with data sets containing no anomalous samples at all. The experimental results on some benchmark data sets from UCI data set repertory show that the detection rate is improved evidently, accompanied by a slight increase in false alarm rate via introducing novel synthetic samples of the anomaly class. The advantages of our method are the increased ability of classifiers in identifying both previously known and innovative anomalies, and the maximal degradation of overfitting phenomenon.|Xiaoshu Hang,Honghua Dai","65576|AAAI|2005|Discriminative Training of Markov Logic Networks|Many machine learning applications require a combination of probability and first-order logic. Markov logic networks (MLNs) accomplish this by attaching weights to first-order clauses, and viewing these as templates for features of Markov networks. Model parameters (i.e., clause weights) can be learned by maximizing the likelihood of a relational database, but this can be quite costly and lead to suboptimal results for any given prediction task. In this paper we propose a discriminative approach to training MLNs, one which optimizes the conditional likelihood of the query predicates given the evidence ones, rather than the joint likelihood of all predicates. We extend Collins's () voted perceptron algorithm for HMMs to MLNs by replacing the Viterbi algorithm with a weighted satisfiability solver. Experiments on entity resolution and link prediction tasks show the advantages of this approach compared to generative MLN training, as well as compared to purely probabilistic and purely logical approaches.|Parag Singla,Pedro Domingos","57541|GECCO|2005|Is negative selection appropriate for anomaly detection|Negative selection algorithms for hamming and real-valued shape-spaces are reviewed. Problems are identified with the use of these shape-spaces, and the negative selection algorithm in general, when applied to anomaly detection. A straightforward self detector classification principle is proposed and its classification performance is compared to a real-valued negative selection algorithm and to a one-class support vector machine. Earlier work suggests that real-value negative selection requires a single class to learn from. The investigations presented in this paper reveal, however, that when applied to anomaly detection, the real-valued negative selection and self detector classification techniques require positive and negative examples to achieve a high classification accuracy. Whereas, one-class SVMs only require examples from a single class.|Thomas Stibor,Philipp H. Mohr,Jonathan Timmis,Claudia Eckert","65938|AAAI|2006|Domain-Independent Structured Duplicate Detection|The scalability of graph-search algorithms can be greatly extended by using external memory, such as disk, to store generated nodes. We consider structured duplicate detection, an approach to external-memory graph search that limits the number of slow disk IO operations needed to access search nodes stored on disk by using an abstract representation of the graph to localize memory references. For graphs with sufficient locality, structured duplicate detection outperforms other approaches to external-memory graph search. We develop an automatic method for creating an abstract representation that reveals the local structure of a graph. We then integrate this approach into a domain-independent STRIPS planner and show that it dramatically improves scalability for a wide range of planning problems. The success of this approach strongly suggests that similar local structure can be found in many other graph-search problems.|Rong Zhou,Eric A.

The model combines a negative selection algorithm and a self-organizing map (SOM) in an immune inspired architecture. The proposed system is able to produce a visual representation of the selfnon-self feature space, thanks to the topological -dimensional map produced by the SOM.

Although support vector machines (SVMs) have been a dominant machine learning technique for the past decade, they have generally been applied to supervised learning problems. Developing unsupervised extensions to SVMs has in fact proved to be difficult. In this paper, we present a principled approach to unsupervised SVM training by formulating convex relaxations of the natural training criterion find a labeling that would yield an optimal SVM classifier on the resulting training data. The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well. While previous work has concentrated on the two-class case, we present a general, multi-class formulation that can be applied to a wider range of natural data sets. The resulting training procedures are computationally intensive, but produce high quality generalization results.|Linli Xu,Dale Schuurmans","65537|AAAI|2005|Word Sense Disambiguation with Semi-Supervised Learning|Current word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems based on supervised learning are still limited in that they do not work well for all words in a language. One of the main reasons is the lack of sufficient training data. In this paper, we investigate the use of unlabeled training data for WSD, in the framework of semi-supervised learning. Four semisupervised leaming algorithms are evaluated on  nouns of Senseval- (SE) English lexical sample task and SE English all-words task.

In this paper, we show that the approach of automatically gathering training examples from parallel texts is scalable to a large set of nouns. We conducted evaluation on the nouns of SENSEVAL- English all-words task, using fine-grained sense scoring. Our evaluation shows that training on examples gathered from MB of parallel texts achieves accuracy comparable to the best system of SENSEVAL- English all-words task, and significantly outperforms the baseline of always choosing sense  of WordNet.|Yee Seng Chan,Hwee Tou Ng","65528|AAAI|2005|SenseRelate  TargetWord-A Generalized Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation|Many words in natural language have different meanings when used in different contexts.

This paper proposes a method to combat user fatigue by augmenting user evaluations with a synthetic fitness function. The proposed method combines partial ordering concepts, notion of non-domination from multiobjective optimization, and support vector machines to synthesize a fitness model based on user evaluation. The proposed method is used in an iGA on a simple test problem and the results demonstrate that the method actively combats user fatigue by requiring -- times less user evaluation when compared to a simple iGA.|Xavier Llorà,Kumara Sastry,David E.

The use of kernels in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) provides an excellent mechanism to introduce prior knowledge into the SVM learners, such as by using unlabeled text or existing ontologies as additional knowledge sources. Our aim is to develop three kernels - one that makes use of knowledge derived from unlabeled text, the second using semantic knowledge from ontologies, and finally a third, additive kernel consisting of the first two kernels - and study their effect on the tasks of word sense disambiguation and automatic expansion of ambiguous acronyms.|Mahesh Joshi,Ted Pedersen,Richard Maclin,Serguei V.

Each kernel function is suitable for some tasks. A universal kernel is not possible, and the kernel must be chosen for the tasks under consideration by hand. In order to obtain a flexible kernel function, a family of radial basis function (RBF) kernels is proposed. Multi-scale RBF kernels are combined by including weights. Then, the evolutionary strategies are used to adjust these weights and the widths of the RBF kernels. The proposed kernel is proved to be a Mercer's kernel. The experimental results show that the use of multi-scale RBF kernels result in better performance than that of a single Gaussian RBF on benchmarks.|Tanasanee Phienthrakul,Boonserm Kijsirikul","65493|AAAI|2005|Unsupervised Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation via an Interlingua|We present an unsupervised method for resolving word sense ambiguities in one language by using statistical evidence assembled from other languages.

The purpose of data selection is to reduce the dataset by eliminating as many non support vectors (non-SVs) as possible. Based on the fact that support vectors (SVs) are those vectors close to the decision boundary, data selection keeps only the closest pair vectors of opposite classes. The selected dataset will replace the full dataset as the training component for any standard SVM algorithm.|Chaofan Sun","65390|AAAI|2005|Learning Support Vector Machines from Distributed Data Sources|In this paper we address the problem of learning Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers from distributed data sources.
