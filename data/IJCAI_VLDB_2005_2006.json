This knowledge is represented using publicly available ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, such as the Open Directory these ontologies are further enriched by several orders of magnitude through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the documents alone. Experimental results confirm improved performance, breaking through the plateau previously reached in the field.|Evgeniy Gabrilovich,Shaul Markovitch","16136|IJCAI|2005|Learning Strategies for Open-Domain Natural Language Question Answering|We present an approach to automatically learning strategies for natural language question answering from examples composed of textual sources, questions, and answers.

TimeML--an emerging standard for temporal annotation as a language capturing properties and relationships among timedenoting expressions and events in text--is a good starting point for bridging the gap between temporal analysis of documents and reasoning with the information derived from them. Hard as TimeML-compliant analysis is, the small size of the only currently available annotated corpus makes it even harder. We address this problem with a hybrid TimeML annotator, which uses cascaded finite-state grammars (for temporal expression analysis, shallow syntactic parsing, and feature generation) together with a machine learning component capable of effectively using large amounts of unannotated data.|Branimir Boguraev,Rie Kubota Ando","16233|IJCAI|2005|A Machine Learning Approach to Identification and Resolution of One-Anaphora|We present a machine learning approach to identifying and resolving one-anaphora.

Two important issues associated with an ensemble approach are how to generate models to construct an ensemble, and how to combine them for classification. In this paper, we focus on the problem of model generation for heterogeneous data classification. If we could partition heterogeneous data into a number of homogeneous partitions, we will likely generate reliable and accurate classification models over the homogeneous partitions. We examine different ways of forming homogeneous subsets and propose a novel method that allows a data point to be assigned multiple times in order to generate homogeneous partitions for ensemble learning. We present the details of the new algorithm and empirical studies over the UCI benchmark datasets and datasets of image classification, and show that the proposed approach is effective for heterogeneous data classification.|Rong Jin,Huan Liu","16046|IJCAI|2005|A language for functional interpretation of model based simulation|Functional modeling is in use for the interpretation of the results of model based simulation of engineered systems for design analysis, enabling the automatic generation of a textual design analysis report that expresses the results of the simulation in terms of the system's purpose.

Schema mappings for both relational and nested data are well-known. In this work, we present a new formalism for schema mapping that extends these existing formalisms in two significant ways. First, our nested mappings allow for nesting and correlation of mappings. This results in a natural programming paradigm that often yields more accurate specifications. In particular, we show that nested mappings can naturally preserve correlations among data that existing mapping formalisms cannot. We also show that using nested mappings for purposes of exchanging data from a source to a target will result in less redundancy in the target data. The second extension to the mapping formalism is the ability to express, in a declarative way, grouping and data merging semantics. This semantics can be easily changed and customized to the integration task at hand. We present a new algorithm for the automatic generation of nested mappings from schema matchings (that is, simple element-to-element correspondences between schemas). We have implemented this algorithm, along with algorithms for the generation of transformation queries (e.g., XQuery) based on the nested mapping specification. We show that the generation algorithms scale well to large, highly nested schemas. We also show that using nested mappings in data exchange can drastically reduce the execution cost of producing a target instance, particularly over large data sources, and can also dramatically improve the quality of the generated data.|Ariel Fuxman,Mauricio A.

The alerter is a lightweight mechanism that provides guaranteed lower (and upper bounds) on the improvement that a DBA could expect by invoking a comprehensive physical design tool. Moreover, it produces an accompanying recommendation that serves as a \"proof\" for the lower bound.

Examples of functionality that has been added are top N , ranking , , spreadsheet computations , grouping sets , data cube , and moving sums  in order to name just a few. Unfortunately, many modern OLAP systems do not use that functionality or replicate a great deal of it in addition to other database-related functionality. In fact, the gap between the functionality provided by an OLAP system and the functionality used from the underlying database systems has widened in the past, rather than narrowed. The reasons for this trend are that SQL as a data definition and query language, the relational model, and the clientserver architecture of the current generation of database products have fundamental shortcomings for OLAP. This paper lists these deficiencies and presents the BTell OLAP engine as an example on how to bridge these shortcomings. In addition, we discuss how to extend current DBMS to better support OLAP in the future.|Jens-Peter Dittrich,Donald Kossmann,Alexander Kreutz","80564|VLDB|2005|Native XML Support in DB Universal Database|The major relational database systems have been providing XML support for several years, predominantly by mapping XML to existing concepts such as LOBs or (object-)relational tables.

Thus, a forthcoming version of DB Universal Database&reg is enhanced with comprehensive native XML support. \"Native\" means that XML documents are stored on disk pages in tree structures matching the XML data model.

Solution to the containment problem for F-logic queries can help with query optimization as well as the classification problem in information integration systems. An important property of F-logic queries, which sets them apart from database queries, is that they can mix the data-level and the meta-level in simple and useful ways. This means that such queries may refer not only to data but also schema information. To the best of our knowledge, the containment problem for such queries has not been considered in the literature.

The domain user must then tune the system select the right component to be executed and correctly adjust their numerous \"knobs\" (e.g., thresholds, formula coefficients). Tuning is skill- and time-intensive, but (as we show) without it the matching accuracy is significantly inferior.We describe eTuner, an approach to automatically tune schema matching systems. Given a schema S, we match S against synthetic schemas, for which the ground truth mapping is known, and find a tuning that demonstrably improves the performance of matching S against real schemas. To efficiently search the huge space of tuning configurations, eTuner works sequentially, starting with tuning the lowest level components. To increase the applicability of eTuner, we develop methods to tune a broad range of matching components. While the tuning process is completely automatic, eTuner can also exploit user assistance (whenever available) to further improve the tuning quality. We employed eTuner to tune four recently developed matching systems on several real-world domains. eTuner produced tuned matching systems that achieve higher accuracy than using the systems with currently possible tuning methods, at virtually no cost to the domain user.|Mayssam Sayyadian,Yoonkyong Lee,AnHai Doan,Arnon Rosenthal","80481|VLDB|2005|Database Publication Practices|There has been a growing interest in improving the publication processes for database research papers.

In the recent years, a significant number of papers have appeared which has advanced the state-of-the-art in synopsis construction considerably. In particular, we have seen the development of a large number of efficient algorithms which are also guaranteed to be near optimal. Furthermore, these synopsis construction problems have found deep roots in theory and database systems, and have influenced a wide range of problems. In a different level, a large number of the synopsis construction algorithms use a similar set of techniques. It is extremely valuable to discuss and analyze these techniques, and we expect broader pictures and paradigms to emerge. This would allow us to develop algorithms for newer problems with greater ease. Understanding these recurrent themes and intuition behind the development of these algorithms is one of the main thrusts of the tutorial.Our goal will be to cover a wide spectrum of these topics and make the researchers in VLDB community aware of the new algorithms, optimum or approximate, offline or streaming.

Coarse-grained arc consistency algorithms like AC-, AC-d and AC- are efficient when it comes to transforming a CSP to its arc-consistent equivalent. These algorithms repeatedly carry out revisions. Revisions require support checks for identifying and deleting all unsupported values from the domain of a variable. In revisions for difficult problems most values have some support. Indeed, most revisions are ineffective, i.e. they cannot delete any value and consume a lot of checks and time. We propose two solutions to overcome these problems. First we introduce the notion of a Support Condition (SC) which guarantees that a value has some support. SCs reduce support checks while maintaining arc consistency during search. Second we introduce the notion of a Revision Condition (RC) which guarantees that all values have support. A RC avoids a candidate revision and queue maintenance overhead. For random problems, SCs reduce the checks required by MAC- (MAC-) up to % (%). RCs avoid at least % of the total revisions.

In this paper, we share our experience of efficient processing of XSLT in Oracle XML DB. We present the technique of processing XSLT efficiently in database by rewriting XSLT stylesheets into highly efficient XQuery through partially evaluating XSLT over the XML documents structural information. Consequently, we can leverage all the work done for efficient XQueryXPath processing in database to achieve combined optimisations of XSLT with XQueryXPath and SQLXML in Oracle XMLDB.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

We present an extensible stream database system that allows scalable and flexible continuous queries on such streams. Application dependent streams and query functions are defined through an object-relational model. Distributed execution plans for continuous queries are described as high-level data flow distribution templates. Using a generic template we define two partitioning strategies for scalable parallel execution of expensive stream queries window split and window distribute. Window split provides operators for parallel execution of query functions by reducing the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluate these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that window split is favorable when expensive queries are executed on limited resources, while window distribution is better otherwise.|Milena Ivanova,Tore Risch","80616|VLDB|2006|Querying Business Processes|We present in this paper BP-QL, a novel query language for querying business processes.

In practice, it is a challenge to incorporate such mechanisms into a high-performance stream management system that is operational in an industrial application.In this paper, we introduce a system for punctuation-carrying heartbeat generation that we developed for Gigascope, a high-performance streaming database for network monitoring, that is operationally used within AT&T's IP backbone. We show how heartbeats can be regularly generated by low-level nodes in query execution plans and propagated upward unblocking all streaming operators on its way. Additionally, our heartbeat mechanism can be used for other applications in distributed settings such as detecting node failures, performance monitoring, and query optimization. A performance evaluation using live data feeds shows that our system is capable of working at multiple Gigabit line speeds in a live, industrial deployment and can significantly decrease the query memory utilization.|Theodore Johnson,S.

The BP-QL language is based on an intuitive model of business processes, an abstraction of the emerging BPEL (business process execution language) standard. It allows users to query business processes visually, in a manner very analogous to how such processes are typically specified, and can be employed in a distributed setting, where process components may be provided by distinct providers. We describe here the query language as well as its underlying formal model. We consider the properties of the various language components and explain how they influenced the language design. In particular we distinguish features that can be efficiently supported, and those that incur a prohibitively high cost, or cannot be computed at all. We also present our implementation which complies with real life standards for business process specifications, XML, and Web services, and is used in the BP-QL system.|Catriel Beeri,Anat Eyal,Simon Kamenkovich,Tova Milo","80707|VLDB|2006|Load Shedding in Stream Databases A Control-Based Approach|In Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs), query processing has to meet various Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs. It is also robust and bears negligible computational overhead.|Yi-Cheng Tu,Song Liu,Sunil Prabhakar,Bin Yao"],["16301|IJCAI|2005|SVM-based Obstacles Recognition for Road Vehicle Applications|This paper describes an obstacle Recognition System based on SVM and vision.

In this model, borrowed from Information Retrieval, documents are represented as a vector where each component is associated with a particular word from the vocabulary. Traditionally, each component value is assigned using the information retrieval TFIDF measure. While this weighting method seems very appropriate for IR, it is not clear that it is the best choice for TC problems. Actually, this weighting method does not leverage the information implicitly contained in the categorization task to represent documents. In this paper, we introduce a new weighting method based on statistical estimation of the importance of a word for a specific categorization problem. This method also has the benefit to make feature selection implicit, since useless features for the categorization problem considered get a very small weight. Extensive experiments reported in the paper shows that this new weighting method improves significantly the classification accuracy as measured on many categorization tasks.|Pascal Soucy,Guy W.

In this paper, a co-training style semi-supervised regression algorithm, i.e. COREG, is proposed. This algorithm uses two k-nearest neighbor regressors with different distance metrics, each of which labels the unlabeled data for the other regressor where the labeling confidence is estimated through consulting the influence of the labeling of unlabeled examples on the labeled ones. Experiments show that COREG can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve regression estimates.|Zhi-Hua Zhou,Ming Li","16340|IJCAI|2005|Question Classification by Structure Induction|In this article we introduce a new approach (and several implementations) to the task of question classification.

This paper explores subjective representations for planning that are learned directly from agent observations and actions (requiring no initial domain knowledge). A non-linear embedding technique called Action Respecting Embedding is used to construct such a representation. It is then shown how to extract the effects of the agent's actions as operators in this learned representation. Finally, the learned representation and operators are combined with search to find sequences of actions that achieve given goals.

In this paper, we propose a feature-based indexing technique, called FIX, based on spectral graph theory. The basic idea is that for each twig pattern in a collection of XML documents, we calculate a vector of features based on its structural properties. These features are used as keys for the patterns and stored in a B+tree. Given an XPath query, its feature vector is first calculated and looked up in the index. Then a further refinement phase is performed to fetch the final results. We experimentally study the indexing technique over both synthetic and real data sets. Our experiments show that FIX provides great pruning power and could gain an order of magnitude performance improvement for many XPath queries over existing evaluation techniques.|Ning Zhang 0002,M.

Redundantly stored information can lead not just to a higher data storage cost, but also to increased costs for data transfer and data manipulation. Furthermore, such data redundancies can lead to potential update anomalies, rendering the database inconsistent.One way to avoid data redundancies is to employ good schema design based on known functional dependencies. In fact, several recent studies have focused on defining the notion of XML Functional Dependencies (XML FDs) to capture XML data redundancies. We observe further that XML databases are often \"casually designed\" and XML FDs may not be determined in advance. Under such circumstances, discovering XML data redundancies (in terms of FDs) from the data itself becomes necessary and is an integral part of the schema refinement process.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first system, DiscoverXFD, for effcient discovery of XML data redundancies. It employs a novel XML data structure and introduces a new class of partition based algorithms. DiscoverXFD can not only be used for the previous definitions of XML functional dependencies, but also for a more comprehensive notion we develop in this paper, capable of detecting redundancies involving set elements while maintaining clear semantics. Experimental evaluations using real life and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system is practical and scales well with increasing data size.|Cong Yu,H. V.

Due to structural heterogeneity of XML, queries are often interpreted approximately and their answers are returned ranked by scores. Computing answer scores in XML is an active area of research that oscillates between pure content scoring such as the well-known tf*idf and taking structure into account. However, none of the existing proposals fully accounts for structure and combines it with content to score query answers. We propose novel XML scoring methods that are inspired by tf*idf and that account for both structure and content while considering query relaxations. Twig scoring, accounts for the most structure and content and is thus used as our reference method. Path scoring is an approximation that loosens correlations between query nodes hence reducing the amount of time required to manipulate scores during top-k query processing. We propose efficient data structures in order to speed up ranked query processing. We run extensive experiments that validate our scoring methods and that show that path scoring provides very high precision while improving score computation time.|Sihem Amer-Yahia,Nick Koudas,Am√©lie Marian,Divesh Srivastava,David Toman","80644|VLDB|2006|SMOQE A System for Providing Secure Access to XML|XML views have been widely used to enforce access control, support data integration, and speed up query answering.

Due to continuous changes in these values, and limited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), it is often infeasible for the database to store the exact values at all times. Queries that uses these old values can produce invalid results. In order to manage the uncertainty between the actual sensor value and the database value, we propose a system called U-DBMS. U-DBMS extends the database system with uncertainty management functionalities. In particular, each data value is represented as an interval and a probability distribution function, and it can be processed with probabilistic query operators to produce imprecise (but correct) answers. This demonstration presents a PostgreSQL-based system that handles uncertainty and probabilistic queries for constantly-evolving data.|Reynold Cheng,Sarvjeet Singh,Sunil Prabhakar","80468|VLDB|2005|ULoad Choosing the Right Storage for Your XML Application|A key factor for the outstanding success of database management systems is physical data independence queries, and application programs, are able to refer to the data at the logical level, ignoring the details on how the data is physically stored and accessed by the system.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs.

Because in many practical cases, sets of assignments can be represented implicitly and compactly using symbolic techniques such as decision diagrams, the set-based algorithm can compute bounds faster than explicitly searching over individual assignments, while memory explosion can be avoided by limiting the size of the sets. Varying the size of the sets yields a family of algorithms that includes known search and inference algorithms as special cases.

A non-linear embedding technique called Action Respecting Embedding is used to construct such a representation. It is then shown how to extract the effects of the agent's actions as operators in this learned representation. Finally, the learned representation and operators are combined with search to find sequences of actions that achieve given goals.

Due to continuous changes in these values, and limited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), it is often infeasible for the database to store the exact values at all times. Queries that uses these old values can produce invalid results. In order to manage the uncertainty between the actual sensor value and the database value, we propose a system called U-DBMS. U-DBMS extends the database system with uncertainty management functionalities. In particular, each data value is represented as an interval and a probability distribution function, and it can be processed with probabilistic query operators to produce imprecise (but correct) answers. This demonstration presents a PostgreSQL-based system that handles uncertainty and probabilistic queries for constantly-evolving data.|Reynold Cheng,Sarvjeet Singh,Sunil Prabhakar","80593|VLDB|2005|WmXML A System for Watermarking XML Data|As increasing amount of data is published in the form of XML, copyright protection of XML data is becoming an important requirement for many applications. While digital watermarking is a widely used measure to protect digital data from copyright offences, the complex and flexible construction of XML data poses a number of challenges to digital watermarking, such as re-organization and alteration attacks. To overcome these challenges, the watermarking scheme has to be based on the usability of data and the underlying semantics like key attributes and functional dependencies. In this paper, we describe WmXML, a system for watermarking XML documents. It generates queries from essential semantics to identify the available watermarking bandwidth in XML documents, and integrates query rewriting technique to overcome the threats from data re-organization and alteration. In the demonstration, we will showcase the use of WmXML and its effectiveness in countering various attacks.|Xuan Zhou,HweeHwa Pang,Kian-Lee Tan,Dhruv Mangla","80701|VLDB|2006|AQAX A System for Approximate XML Query Answers|On-line, interactive exploration of large databases becomes prohibitively expensive as the size of the database grows. Approximate query answering offers a cost-effective solution to this problem, by enabling the fast generation of approximate results based on concise data summaries. We apply this paradigm in the context of XML databases, where the increased complexity of data and queries amplifies the challenges behind interactive exploration. We have developed an on-line XML exploration system, termed AQAX that relies on accurate XML summaries in order to enable the rapid exploration of large data sets. To effectively support the exploration of semi-structured query answers, our system employs a tight coupling between the main query processor and the graphical clients that visualize the results.

Most existing work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem, which considers the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set of features. Such an approach has two drawbacks ) it leaves many partial similarities uncovered ) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the k-n-match problem in this paper.The k-n-match problem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the data objects in n dimensions, where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and these n dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objects returned in the answer set match best. The k-n-match query is expected to be superior to the kNN query in discovering partial similarities, however, it may not be as good in identifying full similarity since a single value of n may only correspond to a particular aspect of an object instead of the entirety. To address this problem, we further introduce the frequent k-n-match problem, which finds a set of objects that appears in the k-n-match answers most frequently for a range of n values. Moreover, we propose search algorithms for both problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of individual attributes retrieved, which is especially useful for information retrieval from multiple systems. We can also apply the proposed algorithmic strategy to achieve a disk based algorithm for the (frequent) k-n-match query. By a thorough experimental study using both real and synthetic data sets, we show that ) the k-n-match query yields better result than the kNN query in identifying similar objects by partial similarities ) our proposed method (for processing the frequent k-n-match query) outperforms existing techniques for similarity search in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.|Anthony K.

The reason is that XML query operators are much more complex than relational operators such as table scans and joins. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called COMET, to modeling the cost of XML operators to our knowledge, COMET is the first method ever proposed for addressing the XML query costing problem. As in relational cost estimation, COMET exploits a set of system catalog statistics that summarizes the XML data the set of \"simple path\" statistics that we propose is new, and is well suited to the XML setting. Unlike the traditional approach, COMET uses a new statistical learning technique called \"transform regression\" instead of detailed analytical models to predict the overall cost. Besides rendering the cost estimation problem tractable for XML queries, COMET has the further advantage of enabling the query optimizer to be self-tuning, automatically adapting to changes over time in the query workload and in the system environment. We demonstrate COMET's feasibility by developing a cost model for the recently proposed XNAV navigational operator. Empirical studies with synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets show that COMET can quickly obtain accurate cost estimates for a variety of XML queries and data sets.|Ning Zhang 0002,Peter J.

Efficient sharing of computations among multiple continuous queries, especially for the memory- and CPU-intensive window-based operations, is critical. A novel challenge in this scenario is to allow resource sharing among similar queries, even if they employ windows of different lengths. This paper first reviews the existing sharing methods in the literature, and then illustrates the significant performance shortcomings of these methods.This paper then presents a novel paradigm for the sharing of window join queries. Namely we slice window states of a join operator into fine-grained window slices and form a chain of sliced window joins. By using an elaborate pipelining methodology, the number of joins after state slicing is reduced from quadratic to linear. This novel sharing paradigm enables us to push selections down into the chain and flexibly select subsequences of such sliced window joins for computation sharing among queries with different window sizes. Based on the state-slice sharing paradigm, two algorithms are proposed for the chain buildup. One minimizes the memory consumption while the other minimizes the CPU usage. The algorithms are proven to find the optimal chain with respect to memory or CPU usage for a given query workload. We have implemented the slice-share paradigm within the data stream management system CAPE. The experimental results show that our strategy provides the best performance over a diverse range of workload settings among all alternate solutions in the literature.|Song Wang,Elke A.

This paper investigates the development of a novel knowledge insertion algorithm that explores the benefits of prestructuring RBF neural networks by using prior fuzzy domain knowledge and previous training experiences. Pre-structuring is accomplished by using fuzzy rules gained from a domain expert and using them to modify existing Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks.

In this paper, we present the first efficient optimal algorithms for selecting observations for a class of graphical models containing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We provide results for both selecting the optimal subset of observations, and for obtaining an optimal conditional observation plan. For both problems, we present algorithms for the filtering case, where only observations made in the past are taken into account, and the smoothing case, where all observations are utilized. Furthermore we prove a surprising result In most graphical models tasks, if one designs an efficient algorithm for chain graphs, such as HMMs, this procedure can be generalized to polytrees. We prove that the value of information problem is NPPP-hard even for discrete polytrees. It also follows from our results that even computing conditional entropies, which are widely used to measure value of information, is a P-complete problem on polytrees. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world datasets.|Andreas Krause,Carlos Guestrin","16044|IJCAI|2005|Proactive Algorithms for Scheduling with Probabilistic Durations|Proactive scheduling seeks to generate high quality solutions despite execution time uncertainty.

These techniques represent the input in terms broader characteristics and improve efficiency of various applications, e.g., learning, classification, event detection, among many others. In a recent past, the synopsis techniques have gained more currency due to the emerging areas like data stream management.In this tutorial, we propose to revisit algorithms for Wavelet and Histogram synopsis construction. In the recent years, a significant number of papers have appeared which has advanced the state-of-the-art in synopsis construction considerably. In particular, we have seen the development of a large number of efficient algorithms which are also guaranteed to be near optimal. Furthermore, these synopsis construction problems have found deep roots in theory and database systems, and have influenced a wide range of problems. In a different level, a large number of the synopsis construction algorithms use a similar set of techniques. It is extremely valuable to discuss and analyze these techniques, and we expect broader pictures and paradigms to emerge. This would allow us to develop algorithms for newer problems with greater ease. Understanding these recurrent themes and intuition behind the development of these algorithms is one of the main thrusts of the tutorial.Our goal will be to cover a wide spectrum of these topics and make the researchers in VLDB community aware of the new algorithms, optimum or approximate, offline or streaming.

The discovery, a few years ago, of a phase transition phenomenon in inductive logic programming proves that other fundamental characteristics of the learning problems may similarly affect the very possibility of learning under very general conditions. Our work examines the case of grammatical inference. We show that while there is no phase transition when considering the whole hypothesis space, there is a much more severe \"gap\" phenomenon affecting the effective search space of standard grammatical induction algorithms for deterministic finite automata (DFA). Focusing on the search heuristics of the RPNI and RED-BLUE algorithms, we show that they overcome this problem to some extent, but that they are subject to overgeneralization.

In this model, borrowed from Information Retrieval, documents are represented as a vector where each component is associated with a particular word from the vocabulary. Traditionally, each component value is assigned using the information retrieval TFIDF measure. While this weighting method seems very appropriate for IR, it is not clear that it is the best choice for TC problems. Actually, this weighting method does not leverage the information implicitly contained in the categorization task to represent documents. In this paper, we introduce a new weighting method based on statistical estimation of the importance of a word for a specific categorization problem. This method also has the benefit to make feature selection implicit, since useless features for the categorization problem considered get a very small weight. Extensive experiments reported in the paper shows that this new weighting method improves significantly the classification accuracy as measured on many categorization tasks.|Pascal Soucy,Guy W.

Holistic twig query processing techniques ,  have been developed to minimize the intermediate results, namely, those root-to-leaf path matches that are not in the final twig results. However, useless path matches cannot be completely avoided, especially when there is a parent-child relationship in the twig query. Furthermore, existing approaches do not consider the fact that in practice, in order to process XPath or XQuery statements, a more powerful form of twig queries, namely, Generalized-Tree-Pattern (GTP)  queries, is required. Most existing works on processing GTP queries generally calls for costly post-processing for eliminating redundant data andor grouping of the matching results.In this paper, we first propose a novel hierarchical stack encoding scheme to compactly represent the twig results. We introduce TwigStack, a bottom-up algorithm for processing twig queries based on this encoding scheme. Then we show how to efficiently enumerate the query results from the encodings for a given GTP query. To our knowledge, this is the first GTP matching solution that avoids any post path-join, sort, duplicate elimination and grouping operations. Extensive performance studies on various data sets and queries show that the proposed TwigStack algorithm not only has better twig query processing performance than state-of-the-art algorithms, but is also capable of efficiently processing the more complex GTP queries.|Songting Chen,Hua-Gang Li,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Wang-Pin Hsiung,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

These features are used as keys for the patterns and stored in a B+tree. Given an XPath query, its feature vector is first calculated and looked up in the index. Then a further refinement phase is performed to fetch the final results. We experimentally study the indexing technique over both synthetic and real data sets. Our experiments show that FIX provides great pruning power and could gain an order of magnitude performance improvement for many XPath queries over existing evaluation techniques.|Ning Zhang 0002,M.

Distance signature discretizes the distances between objects and network nodes into categories and then encodes these categories. To minimize the storage and search costs, we present the optimal category partition, and the encoding and compression algorithms for the signatures, based on a simplified network topology.

In particular, we model high-dimensional function approximation (HFA) as a storage and retrieval problem, and we show that HFA defines a novel class of applications for high dimensional index structures. The interesting property of HFA is that it imposes a mixed queryupdate workload on the index which leads to novel tradeoffs between the efficiency of search versus updates.

In this paper, we propose a new labeling scheme, called extended Dewey. This is a powerful labeling scheme, since from the label of an element alone, we can derive all the elements names along the path from the root to the element. Based on extended Dewey, we design a novel holistic twig join algorithm, called TJFast. Unlike all previous algorithms based on region encoding, to answer a twig query, TJFast only needs to access the labels of the leaf query nodes. Through this, not only do we reduce disk access, but we also support the efficient evaluation of queries with wildcards in branching nodes, which is very difficult to be answered by algorithms based on region encoding. Finally, we report our experimental results to show that our algorithms are superior to previous approaches in terms of the number of elements scanned, the size of intermediate results and query performance.|Jiaheng Lu,Tok Wang Ling,Chee Yong Chan,Ting Chen"]]}}
