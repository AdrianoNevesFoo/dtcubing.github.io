Integration may lead to more effective and richer cognitive computational models, and to a better understanding of the processes of artificial intelligence across the field. This paper presents a new model for the representation, computation, and learning of temporal logic in connectionist systems. The model allows for the encoding of past and future temporal logic operators in neural networks, through a neural-symbolic translation algorithms introduced in the paper. The networks are relatively simple and can be used for reasoning about time and for learning by examples with the use of standard neural learning algorithms. We validate the model in a well-known application dealing WIth temporal synchronisation in distributed knowledge systems.

The aim of this research is to develop an intrusion detection system based on the function of Dendritic Cells (DCs). DCs are antigen presenting cells and key to the activation of the human immune system, behaviour which has been abstracted to form the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA). In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion, asynchronously correlating the fused data signals with a secondary data stream. Aggregate output of a population of cells is analysed and forms the basis of an anomaly detection system. In this paper the DCA is applied to the detection of outgoing port scans using TCP SYN packets. Results show that detection can be achieved with the DCA, yet some false positives can be encountered when simultaneously scanning and using other network services.

However, as we begin creating autonomous agents to operate in the rich environments of modern videogames and computer simulations, it becomes important to devise agent behaviors that display the visible attributes of intelligence, rather than simply performing optimally. Such visibly intelligent behavior is difficult to specify with rules or characterize in terms of quantifiable objective functions, but it is possible to utilize human intuitions to directly guide a learning system toward the desired sorts of behavior. Policy induction from human-generated examples is a promising approach to training such agents. In this paper, such a method is developed and tested using Lamarckian neuroevolution. Artificial neural networks are evolved to control autonomous agents in a strategy game. The evolution is guided by human-generated examples of play, and the system effectively learns the policies that were used by the player to generate the examples. I.e., the agents learn visibly intelligent behavior. In the future, such methods are likely to play a central rule in creating autonomous agents for complex environments, making it possible to generate rich behaviors derived from nothing more formal than the intuitively generated example, of designers, players, or subject-matter experts.|Bobby D.

The central element to this work is a notion of dominance of one such system over another. This relation is formally based on the agents' progression through a derived information space, but may informally be understood as describing one agent's ability to \"simulate\" another. We present some basic properties of this dominance relation and demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to a basic problem in robotics. We argue that this work is of interest to a broad audience of artificial intelligence researchers for two main reasons. First, it calls attention to the possibility of studying belief spaces in way that generalizes both probabilistic and nondeterministic uncertainty models. Second, it provides a means for evaluating the information that an agent is able to acquire (via its sensors and via conformant actions), independent of any optimality criterion and of the task to be completed.|Jason M.

This work investigates the contribution of gene libraries to Artificial Immune Systems by reproducing and extending an earlier system that used gene libraries. Performance on a job-shop scheduling problem is evaluated empirically with and without gene libraries, and with many different library configurations. We propose that gene libraries encourage diversity in a population of solutions and that the number of components in the gene library parameterises this effect. The number of gene libraries used is found to affect solution fitness and indeed using larger numbers of libraries (and therefore libraries of smaller components) enables higher fitness to be attained. We conclude that gene libraries are likely to be of use in applications where there is a need to maintain the diversity of solutions.|Peter Spellward,Tim Kovacs","58223|GECCO|2007|Modelling danger and anergy in artificial immune systems|Artificial Immune Systems are engineering systems which have been inspired from the functioning of the biological immune system. We present an immune system model which incorporates two biologically motivated mechanisms to protect against autoimmune reactions, or false positives. The first, anergy, has been subject to the intense focus of immunologists as a possible key to autoimmune disease. The second is danger theory, which has attracted much interest as a possible alternative to traditional self-nonself selection models.We adopt a published immunological model, validate and extend it. Using the same calculations and assumptions as the original model, we integrate danger theory into the software.Without anergy, both models - the original and the danger model - produce similar results. When anergy is added, both models' performance improves. However, there seems to be some synergy between the mechanisms anergy has a greater effect on the danger model than the original model. These findings should be of interest both to AIS practitioners and to the immunological community.|Steve Cayzer,Julie Sullivan","57509|GECCO|2005|Evolving visually guided agents in an ambiguous virtual world|The fundamental challenge faced by any visual system within natural environments is the ambiguity caused by the fact that light that falls on the system's sensors conflates multiple attributes of the physical world. Understanding the computational principles by which natural systems overcome this challenge and generate useful behaviour remains the key objective in neuroscience and machine vision research. In this paper we introduce Mosaic World, an artificial life model that maintains the essential characteristics of natural visual ecologies, and which is populated by virtual agents that - through 'natural' selection - come to resolve stimulus ambiguity by adapting the functional structure of their visual networks according to the statistical structure of their ecological experience.

The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete.

Existing teamwork architectures seeking to address this challenge are monolithic, in that they commit to interaction protocols at the architectural level, and do not allow the designer to mix and match protocols for a given task. We present BITE, a behavior-based teamwork architecture that automates collaboration in physical robots, in a distributed fashion. BITE separates task behaviors that control a robot's interaction with its task, from interaction behaviors that control a robot's interaction with its teammates. This distinction provides for flexibility and modularity in terms of the interactions used by teammates to collaborate effectively. It also allows BITE to synthesize and significantly extend existing teamwork architectures. BITE also incorporates key lessons learned in applying multi-agent teamwork architectures in physical robot teams.

When monitoring spatial phenomena with sensor networks or mobile robots, for example, we need to decide which locations to observe in order to most effectively decrease the uncertainty, at minimum cost. These problems usually are NP-hard. Many observation selection objectives satisfy submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property - adding a sensor to a small deployment helps more than adding it to a large deployment. In this paper, we survey recent advances in systematically exploiting this submodularity property to efficiently achieve near-optimal observation selections, under complex constraints. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approaches on problems of monitoring environmental phenomena and water distribution networks.|Andreas Krause,Carlos Guestrin","65358|AAAI|2005|Reactive Planning in a Motivated Behavioral Architecture|To operate in natural environmental settings, autonomous mobile robots need more than just the ability to navigate in the world, react to perceived situations or follow pre-determined strategies they must be able to plan and to adapt those plans according to the robot's capabilities and the situations encountered.

A first demonstration of this is given here multiple robots with the same or similar body plan, but acting independently, combine self-models such that they accelerate modeling. Two approaches are investigated the robots feed their experiences back into a common modeling engine, or they maintain their own modeling engine but share their best self-models with each other. It was found that the latter approach achieves a significant improvement in modeling compared to a single robot and compared to the former approach.

This paper discusses the use of genetic programming techniques and the unified behavior framework to develop effective control hierarchies using interchangeable behaviors and arbitration components. Given the number of possible variations provided by the framework, evolutionary programming is used to evolve the overall behavior design. Competitive evolution of the behavior population incrementally develops feasible solutions for the domain through competitive ranking. By developing and implementing many simple behaviors independently and then evolving a complex behavior structure suited to the domain, this approach allows for the reuse of elemental behaviors and eases the complexity of development for a given domain. Additionally, this approach has the ability to locate a behavior structure which a developer may not have previously considered, and whose ability exceeds expectations. The evolution of the behavior structure is demonstrated using agents in the Robocode environment, with the evolved structures performing up to  percent better than one crafted by an expert.|Brian G.

General properties and processes of evolutionary artificial ecosystems are presented as a basis for developing individual systems that automate the discovery of novelty without explicit teleological goals. The adaptation of species to fit their environment drives the creative solutions, so the role of the designer shifts to the design of environments.

Performance on a job-shop scheduling problem is evaluated empirically with and without gene libraries, and with many different library configurations. We propose that gene libraries encourage diversity in a population of solutions and that the number of components in the gene library parameterises this effect. The number of gene libraries used is found to affect solution fitness and indeed using larger numbers of libraries (and therefore libraries of smaller components) enables higher fitness to be attained. We conclude that gene libraries are likely to be of use in applications where there is a need to maintain the diversity of solutions.|Peter Spellward,Tim Kovacs","57354|GECCO|2005|An artificial immune network for multimodal function optimization on dynamic environments|Multimodal optimization algorithms inspired by the immune system are generally characterized by a dynamic control of the population size and by diversity maintenance along the search.

After selection of some good genes based on signal-to-noise ratio, unsupervised learning like clustering and supervised learning like k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier are widely used in cancer researches to correlate the pathological behavior of cancers with the gene expression levels' differences in cancerous and normal tissues. By applying adaptive searches like Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Algorithm (PMBGA), it may be possible to get a smaller size gene subset that would classify patient samples more accurately than the above methods.

For cost-optimal planning, however, existing admissible heuristics are generally too weak to effectively guide the search. Pattern database heuristics (PDBs), which are based on abstractions of the search space, are currently one of the most promising approaches to developing better admissible heuristics. The informedness of PDB heuristics depends crucially on the selection of appropriate abstractions (patterns). Although PDBs have been applied to many search problems, including planning, there are not many insights into how to select good patterns, even manually. What constitutes a good pattern depends on the problem domain, making the task even more difficult for domain-independent planning, where the process needs to be completely automatic and generaL We present a novel way of constructing good patterns automatically from the specification of planning problem instances.

A limitation of the use of prior knowledge occurs when the provided knowledge is incorrect. Such knowledge likely still contains useful information, but knowledge-based learners might not be able to fully exploit such information. In fact, incorrect knowledge can lead to poorer models than result from knowledge-free learners.

This allows choosing recognition hypotheses based on their expected utility to the observer. We call this Utility-based Plan Recognition (UPR). While reasoning about such expected utilities is intractable in the general case, we present a hybrid symbolicdecision-theoretic plan recognizer, whose complexity is O(N DT), where N is the plan library size, D is the depth of the library and T is the number of observations.

However, real arguments (i.e. arguments presented by humans) usually do not have enough explicitly presented premises for the entailment of the claim. This is because there is some common knowledge that can be assumed by a proponent of an argument and the recipient of it. This allows the proponent of an argument to encode an argument into a real argument by ignoring the common knowledge, and it allows a recipient of a real argument to decode it into an argument by drawing on the common knowledge. If both the proponent and recipient use the same common knowledge, then this process is straightforward. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and raises the need for an approximation of the notion of an argument for the recipient to cope with the disparities between the different views on what constitutes common knowledge.|Anthony Hunter","66236|AAAI|2007|Optimal Regression for Reasoning about Knowledge and Actions|We show how in the propositional case both Reiter's and Scherl & Levesque's solutions to the frame problem can be modelled in dynamic epistemic logic (DEL), and provide an optimal regression algorithm for the latter.

One example are dynamic problems that change with time. An important class of dynamic problems is the class of tracking problems where an algorithm has to find an approximately optimal solution and insure an almost constant quality in spite of the changing problem. For the application of evolutionary algorithms to static optimization problems, the distribution of the optimization time and most often its expected value are most important. Adopting this perspective a simple tracking problem in the lattice is considered and the performance of a mutation-based evolutionary algorithm is evaluated. For the static case, asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds are proven. These results are applied to derive results on the tracking performance for different rates of change.|Thomas Jansen,Ulf Schellbach","57488|GECCO|2005|The problem with a self-adaptative mutation rate in some environments a case study using the shaky ladder hyperplane-defined functions|Dynamic environments have periods of quiescence and periods of change. In periods of quiescence a Genetic Algorithm (GA) should (optimally) exploit good individuals while in periods of change the GA should (optimally) explore new solutions. Self-adaptation is a mechanism which allows individuals in the GA to choose their own mutation rate, and thus allows the GA to control when it explores new solutions or exploits old ones. We examine the use of this mechanism on a recently devised dynamic test suite, the Shaky Ladder Hyperplane-Defined Functions (sl-hdf's). This test suite can generate random problems with similar levels of difficulty and provides a platform allowing systematic controlled observations of the GA in dynamic environments. We show that in a variety of circumstances self-adaptation fails to allow the GA to perform better on this test suite than fixed mutation, even when the environment is static. We also show that mutation is beneficial throughout the run of a GA, and that seeding a population with known good genetic material is not always beneficial to the results. We provide explanations for these observations, with particular emphasis on comparing our results to other results  which have shown the GA to work in static environments. We conclude by giving suggestions as to how to change the simple GA to solve these problems.|William Rand,Rick L.

Both predicted and observed results show a distinct bias towards the sampling of shorter programs irrespective of the mix of function arities used.

In our approach the LMS are implemented via learned probabilistic context-sensitive grammar (LPCSG). The LPCSG is derived from the originally defined context-free grammar, which usually expresses the syntax of genetic programs in canonical GP. Applying LMS implies that the probabilities of applying each of particular production rules in LPCGS during the mutation depend on the context. These probabilities are learned from the aggregated reward values obtained from the parsed syntax of the evolved best-of-generation Snakebots. Empirically obtained results verify that LMS contributes to the improvement of computational effort of both (i) the evolution of the fastest possible locomotion gaits for various fitness conditions and (ii) the adaptation of these locomotion gaits to challenging environment and degraded mechanical abilities of Snakebot. In all of the cases considered in this study, the locomotion gaits, evolved and adapted employing GP with LMS feature higher velocity and are obtained faster than with canonical GP.|Ivan Tanev","58187|GECCO|2007|Numerical-node building block analysis of genetic programming with simplification|This paper investigates the effects on building blocks of using online simplification in a GP system.

For these kernel functions, evolutionary SVM even outperform other learning methods like the Relevance Vector Machine. In this paper, we will discuss another major advantage of evolutionary SVM compared to traditional SVM solutions we can explicitly optimize the inherent trade-off between training error and model complexity by embedding multi-objective optimization into the evolutionary SVM. This leads to three advantages first, it is no longer necessary to tune the SVM parameter C which weighs both conflicting criteria. This is a very time-consuming task for traditional SVM.

However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method. In addition to that, the threshold ai is also evolved by mutation between i - aisi, i + aisi in every generation in order to obtain as many association rules as possible. The features of the proposed method are as follows compared with other methods ) Extracts rules without identifying frequent itemsets used in Apriori-like mining methods. ) Stores extracted important association rules in a pool all together through generations. ) Measures the significance of associations via the chi-squared test. ) Extracts important rules sufficient enough for user's purpose in a short time. ) The pool is updated in every generation and only important association rules with higher chi-squared value are stored when the identical rules are stored. We have evaluated the proposed method by doing two simulations. Simulation  uses fixed threshold values that is, they remain fixed at initial thresholds during evolution. In simulation ,thresholds are evolved by mutation in every generation. Fig.  shows the number of rules extracted in the pool in simulation .

Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents. Our results show that both agents exhibit interesting learning capabilities.|Gul Muhammad Khan,Julian Francis Miller,David M.

GNP is an evolutionary computation, which represents its solutions using graph structures and has some useful features inherently. It has been clarified that GNP works well especially in dynamic environments since GNP can create quite compact programs and has an implicit memory function. In this paper, GNP is applied to creating a stock trading model. There are three important points The first important point is to combine GNP with Sarsa Learning which is one of the reinforcement learning algorithms. Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of  brands in ,  and . Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in . From the simulation results, it is clarified that the trading rules of the proposed method obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method and its effectiveness has been confirmed.|Yan Chen,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","57450|GECCO|2005|Evolution of a human-competitive quantum fourier transform algorithm using genetic programming|In this paper, we show how genetic programming (GP) can be used to evolve system-size-independent quantum algorithms, and present a human-competitive Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) algorithm evolved by GP.|Paul Massey,John A.

Indeed, the growth in the computing power of these graphics cards is now several orders of magnitude greater than the growth in the power of computer processor units. Thus these graphics cards are now beginning to be used by the scientific community aslow cost, high performance computing platforms. Traditional genetic programming is a highly computer intensive algorithm but due to its parallel nature it can be distributed over multiple processors to increase the speed of the algorithm considerably. This is not applicable for single processor architectures but graphics cards provide a mechanism for developing a data parallel implementation of genetic programming. In this paper we will describe the technique of general purpose computing using graphics cards and how to extend this technique to genetic programming. We will demonstrate the improvement in the performance of genetic programming on single processor architectures which can be achieved by harnessing the computing power of these next generation graphics cards.|Darren M.

Developmental errors exist during the biological development of an individual. The biological models with developmental errors have demonstrated that it is possible to maintain redundant copies in the existence of proper mutation rates and developmental error rates. Our preliminary results with a simple problem demonstrates that using developmental error helps preserving the redundant copies and maintaining a better solution quality for the redundant copies of a gene.

Roughly, they tend to identify local optima with large basins of attraction which may or may not correspond to global optima. A question which arises is whether one can modify the algorithm to promote the discovery of global optima. We argue that a mechanism from Pareto coevolution can achieve this end. We observe that in CCEAs candidate individuals from one population are used as tests or measurements of individuals in other populations by treating individuals as tests in this way, a finer-grained comparison can be made among candidate individuals. This finer-grained view permits an algorithm to see when two candidates are differently capable, even when one's evident value is higher than the other's. By modifying an existing CCEA to compare individuals using Pareto dominance we have produced an algorithm which reliably finds global optima.

The aim of solving such problems is to obtain solutions that in terms of objectives and feasibility are as good as possible and at the same time are least sensitive to the parameter variations. Such solutions are said to be robust optimum solutions. In order to investigate the trade-off between the performance and robustness of optimum solutions, we present a new Robust Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (RMOGA) that optimizes two objectives a fitness value and a robustness index. The fitness value serves as a measure of performance of design solutions with respect to multiple objectives and feasibility of the original optimization problem. The robustness index, which is based on a non-gradient based parameter sensitivity estimation approach, is a measure that quantitatively evaluates the robustness of design solutions. RMOGA does not require a presumed probability distribution of uncontrollable parameters and also does not utilize the gradient information of these parameters. Three distance metrics are used to obtain the robustness index and robust solutions.

Two kinds of bloat must be distinguished in that context, depending whether the target function lies in the search space or not. Then, important mathematical results are proved using classical results from Statistical Learning. Namely, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of programs is computed, and further results from Statistical Learning allow to prove that a parsimonious fitness ensures Universal Consistency (the solution minimizing the empirical error does converge to the best possible error when the number of examples goes to infinity). However, it is proved that the standard method consisting in choosing a maximal program size depending on the number of examples might still result in programs of infinitely increasing size with their accuracy a more complicated modification of the fitness is proposed that theoretically avoids unnecessary bloat while nevertheless preserving the Universal Consistency.|Sylvain Gelly,Olivier Teytaud,Nicolas Bredeche,Marc Schoenauer","65546|AAAI|2005|Robust Textual Inference Via Learning and Abductive Reasoning|We present a system for textual inference (the task of inferring whether a sentence follows from another text) that uses learning and a logical-formula semantic representation of the text.

Amongst these, a prominent one is automated Web Service Composition (WSC). One important issue in this context has been hardly addressed so far WSC requires dealing with background ontologies. The support for those is severely limited in current planning tools. We introduce a planning formalism that faithfully represents WSC. We show that, unsurprisingly, planning in such a formalism is very hard. We then identify an interesting special case that covers many relevant WSC scenarios, and where the semantics are simpler and easier to deal with. This opens the way to the development of effective support tools for WSC.

Users can also attack or support parts of existing arguments, use existing parts of an argument in the creation of new arguments, or create new argumentation schemes. As such, this initial public-domain tool is intended to seed a variety of future applications for authoring, linking, navigating, searching, and evaluating arguments on the Web.|Iyad Rahwan,Fouad Zablith,Chris Reed","66193|AAAI|2007|Model-lite Planning for the Web Age Masses The Challenges of Planning with Incomplete and Evolving Domain Models|The automated planning community has traditionally focused on the efficient synthesis of plans given a complete domain theory.

However, ratings reflect tastes of the raters. Therefore, service selection using ratings may mislead the consumers having a taste different than that of the raters. We propose to use experiences instead of the ratings. Experiences are the representation of what is requested by a consumer and what is received at the end. Unlike ratings, experiences do not reflect the opinion of the others, but the actual story between consumers and providers concerning a service demand. Using experiences, the consumer models the services of a provider for a specific service demand and selects the provider that is expected to satisfy the consumer the most. Our simulations show that proposed approach significantly increases the overall satisfaction of the service consumers.|Murat Sensoy","66048|AAAI|2007|A Planning Approach for Message-Oriented Semantic Web Service Composition|In this paper, we consider the problem of composing a set of web services, where the requirements are specified in terms of the input and output messages of the composite workflow.

The aim of solving such problems is to obtain solutions that in terms of objectives and feasibility are as good as possible and at the same time are least sensitive to the parameter variations. Such solutions are said to be robust optimum solutions. In order to investigate the trade-off between the performance and robustness of optimum solutions, we present a new Robust Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (RMOGA) that optimizes two objectives a fitness value and a robustness index. The fitness value serves as a measure of performance of design solutions with respect to multiple objectives and feasibility of the original optimization problem. The robustness index, which is based on a non-gradient based parameter sensitivity estimation approach, is a measure that quantitatively evaluates the robustness of design solutions. RMOGA does not require a presumed probability distribution of uncontrollable parameters and also does not utilize the gradient information of these parameters. Three distance metrics are used to obtain the robustness index and robust solutions. To illustrate its application, RMOGA is applied to two well-studied engineering design problems from the literature.|Mian Li,Shapour Azarm,Vikrant Aute","57972|GECCO|2007|Kernel based automatic clustering using modified particle swarm optimization algorithm|This paper introduces a method for clustering complex and linearly non-separable datasets, without any prior knowledge of the number of naturally occurring clusters.

It uses a data clustering algorithm to detect clusters in GA population, which identifies the attractors in the fitness landscape. Then, subpopulations which makes-up the clusters are isolated and optimized independently. Meanwhile, the region of the isolated subpopulations in the original landscape are suppressed. The isolation increases comprehensiveness, i.e., the probability of finding weaker attractors, and the overall efficiency of multimodal search. The advantage of the AIM is that it does not require distance between the optima as a presumed parameter, as it is estimated from the variancecovariance matrix of the subpopulation.Further, AIM's behavior and efficiency is equivalent to basic GA in unimodal landscape, in terms of number of evaluation. Therefore, it is applied recursively to all subpopulations until they converge to a suboptima. This makes AIM suitable for locally-multimodal landscapes, which have closely located attractors that are difficult to distinguish in the initial run.The performance of AIM is evaluated in several benchmark problems and compared to iterated hill-climbing methods.|Shin Ando,Jun Sakuma,Shigenobu Kobayashi","57271|GECCO|2005|Genetic algorithm optimization of superresolution parameters|Superresolution is the process of producing a high resolution image from a collection of low resolution images.

However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method. In addition to that, the threshold ai is also evolved by mutation between i - aisi, i + aisi in every generation in order to obtain as many association rules as possible.

In addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation reveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in other scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central network component and a high clustering.|Leslie Luthi,Marco Tomassini,Mario Giacobini,William B.

Double-deck elevators, where two cages are connected with each other, are expected to be the next generation elevator systems. Meanwhile, Destination Floor Guidance Systems (DFGS) are also expected in Double-Deck Elevator Systems (DDES). With these, the passengers could be served at two consecutive floors and could input their destinations at elevator halls instead of conventional systems without DFGS. Such systems become more complex than the traditional systems and require new control methods Genetic Network Programming (GNP), a graph-based evolutionary method, has been applied to EGSCS and its advantages are shown in some previous papers. GNP can obtain the strategy of a new hall call assignment to the optimal elevator because it performs crossover and mutation operations to judgment nodes and processing nodes. In studies so far, the passenger's arrival has been assumed to take Exponential distribution for many years. In this paper, we have applied Erlang distribution and Binomial distribution in order to study how the passenger's arrival distribution affects EGSCS. We have found that the passenger's arrival distribution has great influence on EGSCS. It has been also clarified that GNP makes good performances under different conditions.|Lu Yu,Jin Zhou,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu,Sandor Markon","58194|GECCO|2007|An effective genetic algorithm for improving wireless sensor network lifetime|An important scheme for extending sensor network lifetime is to divide sensor nodes into disjoint groups such that each group covers all targets and works alternatively. This scheme can be transformated to the Disjoint Set Covers (DSC) problem, which is proved to be NP-complete. Existing heuristic algorithms either get barely satisfactory solutions or take exponential time complexity. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm to solve the DSC problem. Simulation results show that the proposed genetic algorithm can improve the most constrained-minimum constraining heuristic algorithm (MCMCC) in solution quality by $%$ with only polynomial computation time complexity.|Chih-Chung Lai,Chuan-Kang Ting,Ren-Song Ko","57974|GECCO|2007|Trading rules on stock markets using genetic network programming with sarsa learning|In this paper, the Genetic Network Programming (GNP) for creating trading rules on stocks is described. GNP is an evolutionary computation, which represents its solutions using graph structures and has some useful features inherently. It has been clarified that GNP works well especially in dynamic environments since GNP can create quite compact programs and has an implicit memory function. In this paper, GNP is applied to creating a stock trading model. There are three important points The first important point is to combine GNP with Sarsa Learning which is one of the reinforcement learning algorithms. Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of  brands in ,  and . Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in . From the simulation results, it is clarified that the trading rules of the proposed method obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method and its effectiveness has been confirmed.|Yan Chen,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","57450|GECCO|2005|Evolution of a human-competitive quantum fourier transform algorithm using genetic programming|In this paper, we show how genetic programming (GP) can be used to evolve system-size-independent quantum algorithms, and present a human-competitive Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) algorithm evolved by GP.|Paul Massey,John A.

A new evolutionary computation method named Genetic Network Programming (GNP) has also been developed recently and its efectiveness is shown for small datasets. However, it has not been tested for large datasets, particularly in datasets with a large number of attributes. The aim of this paper is to extract association rules from large and dense datasets using GNP considering a real world database with a huge number of attributes. We propose a new method where a large database is divided into many small datasets, then each GNP deals with one dataset having attributes with appropiate size, which was selected randomly from a large dataset and generated genetically. These GNPs are processed in parallel. We then propose some new genetic operations to improve the number of rules extracted and their quality as well. The proposed method improves remarkably on simulations. Fig.  shows the architecture of the proposed method. We use the CLIENTSERVER model. CLIENT side carries out preprocessing of large database, assignment of files to each server, rule checking, and genetic operations on files. SERVER side carries out processing of each file using conventional GNP based mining method independently. The features and advantages of the proposed method are the following Rule extraction is done in parallel. Each file generates its local pool of the rules. Files or datasets are treated as individuals in order to do new genetic operations over them and improve the rule extraction. Extracted rules are stored in a global pool. The rules are verified to avoid redundancy among them and it is assured that only new rules are stored.|Eloy Gonzales,Kaoru Shimada,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","57454|GECCO|2005|Optimizing parameters of a mobile ad hoc network protocol with a genetic algorithm|Mobile ad hoc networks are typically designed and evaluated in generic simulation environments. However the real conditions in which these networks are deployed can be quite different in terms of RF attentution, topology, and traffic load. Furthermore, specific situations often have a need for a network that is optimized along certain characteristics such as delay, energy or overhead. In response to the variety of conditions and requirements, ad hoc networking protocols are often designed with many modifiable parameters. However, there is currently no methodical way for choosing values for the parameters other than intuition and broad experience. In this paper we investigate the use of genetic algorithms for automated selection of parameters in an ad hoc networking system. We provide experimental results demonstrating that the genetic algorithm can optimize for different classes of operating conditions. We also compare our genetic algorithm optimization against hand-tuning in a complex, realistic scenario and show how the genetic algorithm provides better performance.|David J. Montana,Jason Redi","58127|GECCO|2007|A doubly distributed genetic algorithm for network coding|We present a genetic algorithm which is distributed in two novel ways along genotype and temporal axes. Our algorithm first distributes, for every member of the population, a subset of the genotype to each network node, rather thana subset of the population to each. This genotype distribution is shown to offer a significant gain in running time. Then, for efficient use of the computational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate solutions intopipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal domain, rather that in the spatial domain. This temporal distribution may lead to temporal inconsistency in selection and replacement, however our experiments yield better efficiency in terms of the time to convergence without incurring significant penalties.|Minkyu Kim,Varun Aggarwal,Una-May O'Reilly,Muriel M√©dard"]]}}
