However, the development of SANNs has traditionally focused on data domains that are assumed to be modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of data governed by other statistical models, such as the Poisson distribution, has received less attention from the data mining community. Based on special considerations of the statistical nature of data following a Poisson distribution, this paper introduces a SANN, Poisson-based Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (PSOTA), which implements novel similarity matching criteria and neuron weight adaptation schemes. It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood. This study indicate that, in comparison to the traditional Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA), PSOTA offers significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization in data modeled by the Poisson distribution, such as serial analysis of gene expression data.|Haiying Wang,Huiru Zheng,Francisco Azuaje","58097|GECCO|2007|Mining breast cancer data with XCS|In this paper, we describe the use of a modern learning classifier system to a data mining task.

One method recently developed for doing such inference is a guilt-by-association model. This method has been independently developed in two different settings-relational learning and semi-supervised learning. In relational learning, the setting assumes that the networked data has explicit links such as hyperlinks between webpages or citations between research papers. The semi-supervised setting assumes a corpus of non-relational data and creates links based on similarity measures between the instances. Both use only the known labels in the network to predict the remaining labels but use very different information sources. The thesis of this paper is that if we combine these two types of links, the resulting network will carry more information than either type of link by itself. We test this thesis on six benchmark data sets, using a within-network learning algorithm, where we show that we gain significant improvements in predictive performance by combining the links. We describe a principled way of combining mUltiple types of edges with different edge-weights and semantics using an objective graph measure called node-based assortativity. We investigate the use of this measure to combine text-mined links with explicit links and show that using our approach significantly improves performance of our classifier over naively combining these two types of links.|Sofus A.

We propose a method that uses chain structures as a model for Bayesian networks that can be constructed from given node orderings. The chain model is used to evolve a small number of orderings which are then injected into a greedy search phase which searches for an optimal structure.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16565|IJCAI|2007|Towards Efficient Computation of Error Bounded Solutions in POMDPs Expected Value Approximation and Dynamic Disjunctive Beliefs|While POMDPs (partially observable markov decision problems) are a popular computational model with wide-ranging applications, the computational cost for optimal policy generation is prohibitive.

To address this challenge, we present two new techniques. The first approximates in the value space to obtain solutions efficiently for a pre-specified error bound. Unlike existing techniques, our technique guarantees the resulting policy will meet this bound. Furthermore, it does not require costly computations to determine the quality loss of the policy. Our second technique prunes large tracts of belief space that are unreachable, allowing faster policy computation without any sacrifice in optimality. The combination of the two techniques, which are complementary to existing optimal policy generation algorithms, provides solutions with tight error bounds efficiently in domains where competing algorithms fail to provide such tight bounds.|Pradeep Varakantham,Rajiv T.

The first challenge of Wikipedia is to make the encyclopedia machine-processable. In this study, we address the problem of extracting relations among entities from Wikipedia's English articles, which in turn can serve for intelligent systems to satisfy users' information needs. Our proposed method first anchors the appearance of entities in Wikipedia articles using some heuristic rules that are supported by their encyclopedic style. Therefore, it uses neither the Named Entity Recognizer (NER) nor the Coreference Resolution tool, which are sources of errors for relation extraction. It then classifies the relationships among entity pairs using SVM with features extracted from the web structure and subtrees mined from the syntactic structure of text. The innovations behind our work are the following a) our method makes use of Wikipedia characteristics for entity allocation and entity classification, which are essential for relation extraction b) our algorithm extracts a core tree, which accurately reflects a relationship between a given entity pair, and subsequently identifies key features with respect to the relationship from the core tree.

Given a positive definite kernel function, it is well known that the input data are implicitly mapped to a feature space with usually very high dimensionality. The goal of KFE is to find a low dimensional subspace of this feature space, which retains most of the information needed for classification or data analysis. In this paper, we propose a subspace kernel based on which the feature extraction problem is transformed to a kernel parameter learning problem. The key observation is that when projecting data into a low dimensional subspace of the feature space, the parameters that are used for describing this subspace can be regarded as the parameters of the kernel function between the projected data. Therefore current kernel parameter learning methods can be adapted to optimize this parameterized kernel function. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.|Mingrui Wu,Jason D. R.

They allow a system to take advantage of prior domain knowledge supplied either by a human user or another algorithm, combining that knowledge with data to produce accurate models. A limitation of the use of prior knowledge occurs when the provided knowledge is incorrect. Such knowledge likely still contains useful information, but knowledge-based learners might not be able to fully exploit such information. In fact, incorrect knowledge can lead to poorer models than result from knowledge-free learners. We present a support-vector method for incorporating and refining domain knowledge that not only allows the learner to make use of that knowledge, but also suggests changes to the provided knowledge. Our approach is built on the knowledge-based classification and regression methods presented by Fung, Mangasarian, & Shavlik ( ) and by Mangasarian, Shavlik, & Wild (). Experiments on artificial data sets with known properties, as well as on a real-world data set, demonstrate that our method learns more accurate models while also adjusting the provided rules in intuitive ways.

Many methods instead transform the input data into a set of vectors in a feature space and classify the transformed data using a generic kernel. However, finding an effective transformation scheme for sequence (e.g. time series) data is a difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a scheme for directly designing kernels for the classification of sequence data such as that in handwritten character recognition and object recognition from sensor readings. Ordering information is represented by values of a parameter associated with each input data element. A similarity metric based on the parametric distance between corresponding elements is combined with their problemspecific similarity metric to produce a Mercer kernel suitable for use in methods such as support vector machine (SVM). This scheme directly embeds extraction of features from sequences of varying cardinalities into the kernel without needing to transform all input data into a common feature space before classification. We apply our method to object and handwritten character recognition tasks and compare against current approaches. The results show that we can obtain at least comparable accuracy to state of the art problem-specific methods using a systematic approach to kernel design. Our contribution is the introduction of a general technique for designing SVM kernels tailored for the classification of sequence data.|Young-In Shin,Donald S.

Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme. The proposed scheme reduces Pareto-size and the appropriate number of clusters can usually be determined.|Nobukazu Matake,Tomoyuki Hiroyasu,Mitsunori Miki,Tomoharu Senda","66166|AAAI|2007|Learning Large Scale Common Sense Models of Everyday Life|Recent work has shown promise in using large, publicly available, hand-contributed commonsense databases as joint models that can be used to infer human state from day-to-day sensor data.

The problem may be reduced to figure out the optimal placement of antennae out of a list of candidate sites trying to satisfy two objectives to maximize the area covered by the radio signal and to reduce the number of used antennae. Consequently, RND is a bi-objective optimization problem. Previous works have solved the problem by using single-objective techniques which combine the values of both objectives.

The algorithm's design makes maximum use of the principle of natural selection to evolve valid solutions without the explicit need to verify constraint violations. Our algorithm is based upon a biologically inspired group encoding which allows for a modularisation of the search space in which individual sub-solutions may be assigned independent cost values. These values are subsequently utilised in a crossover event modelled on the theory of exon shuffling to produce a single offspring that inherits the most promising segments from its parents. The algorithm is tested on a set of hard benchmark problems and the results indicate that the method has a very high degree of accuracy and reliability compared to other approaches in the literature.|Philipp Rohlfshagen,John A.

Then, for efficient use of the computational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate solutions intopipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal domain, rather that in the spatial domain.

A lot of effort has been made to develop approximate offline algorithms to solve ever larger POMDPs. However, even state-of-the-art approaches fail to solve large POMDPs in reasonable time. Recent developments in online POMDP search suggest that combining offline computations with online computations is often more efficient and can also considerably reduce the error made by approximate policies computed offline. In the same vein, we propose a new anytime online search algorithm which seeks to minimize, as efficiently as possible, the error made by an approximate value function computed offline. In addition, we show how previous online computations can be reused in following time steps in order to prevent redundant computations.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16565|IJCAI|2007|Towards Efficient Computation of Error Bounded Solutions in POMDPs Expected Value Approximation and Dynamic Disjunctive Beliefs|While POMDPs (partially observable markov decision problems) are a popular computational model with wide-ranging applications, the computational cost for optimal policy generation is prohibitive. Researchers are investigating ever-more efficient algorithms, yet many applications demand such algorithms bound any loss in policy quality when chasing efficiency. To address this challenge, we present two new techniques. The first approximates in the value space to obtain solutions efficiently for a pre-specified error bound. Unlike existing techniques, our technique guarantees the resulting policy will meet this bound. Furthermore, it does not require costly computations to determine the quality loss of the policy. Our second technique prunes large tracts of belief space that are unreachable, allowing faster policy computation without any sacrifice in optimality. The combination of the two techniques, which are complementary to existing optimal policy generation algorithms, provides solutions with tight error bounds efficiently in domains where competing algorithms fail to provide such tight bounds.|Pradeep Varakantham,Rajiv T.

The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision.

Many online solutions for this problem make use of simplifying assumptions, such as Gaussian noise models and linear system behaviour and also adopt a filtering strategy which may not use available information optimally. These assumptions allow near real-time inference, while also limiting accuracy and introducing the potential for ill-conditioning and divergence. We consider augmenting a particular real-time estimation method, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), with a more complex, but more highly accurate, inference technique based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. Conventional MCMC techniques applied to this problem can entail significant and time consuming computation to achieve convergence. To address this, we propose an intelligent bootstrapping process and the use of parallel, communicative chains of different temperatures, commonly referred to as parallel tempering.

This paper presents an architecture and a process for developing neural network game players that utilize explicit opponent models in order to improve game play against unseen opponents. The model is constructed as a mixture over a set of cardinal opponents, i.e. opponents that represent maximally distinct game strategies. The model is trained to estimate the likelihood that the opponent will make the same move as each of the cardinal opponents would in a given game situation. Experiments were performed in the game of Guess It, a simple game of imperfect information that has no optimal strategy for defeating specific opponents. Opponent modeling is therefore crucial to play this game well. Both opponent modeling and game-playing neural networks were trained using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). The results demonstrate that game-playing provided with the model outperform networks not provided with the model when played against the same previously unseen opponents. The cardinal mixture architecture therefore constitutes a promising approach for general and dynamic opponent modeling in game-playing.|Alan J. Lockett,Charles L.

This paper describes how this account can be extended to situations where the effect of an action is partially dependent upon the choices of another agent. In this context we see practical reasoning as proceeding in three stages. The first involves determining the representation of the particular problem scenario as an AATS. Next the agent must resolve its uncertainties as to its position in the scenario. Finally, the agent moves to choosing a particular action to achieve its ends, proposing presumptive reasons for particular actions and subjecting them to a critique to establish their suitability, taking into account the choices that can be made by the other agents involved. This account thus provides a well-specified basis for addressing the problems of practical reasoning as presumptive argumentation in a multi-agent context.|Katie Atkinson,Trevor J. M.

The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data.

This formulation allows us to exploit domain models for both estimating the agent's goals and selecting assistive action. In addition, the formulation naturally handles uncertainty, varying action costs, and customization to specific agents via learning.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|R√©gis Sabbadin,J√©r√¥me Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","16409|IJCAI|2007|Topological Value Iteration Algorithm for Markov Decision Processes|Value Iteration is an inefficient algorithm for Markov decision processes (MDPs) because it puts the majority of its effort into backing up the entire state space, which turns out to be unnecessary in many cases.

However, by means of methods of discretization, it is difficult to get highest attribute interdependency and at the same time to get lowest number of intervals. We propose a method using a new graph-based evolutionary algorithm named \"Genetic Network Programming (GNP)\" that can deal with continues values directly, that is, without using any discretization method as a preprocessing step. GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as solutions and is composed of three kinds of nodes start node, judgment node and processing node. Once GNP is booted up, firstly the execution starts from the start node, secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the judgment and connection from the current activated node. The features of GNP are described as follows. First, it is possible to reuse nodes because of this, the structure is compact. Second, GNP can find solutions of problems without bloat, which can be sometimes found in Genetic Programming (GP), because of the fixed number of nodes in GNP. Third, nodes that are not used at the current program executions will be used for future evolution. Fourth, GNP is able to cope with partially observable Markov processes. In this paper, we propose a method that can deal with continuous attributes, where attributes in databases correspond to judgment nodes in GNP and each continuous attribute is checked whether its value is greater than a threshold value and the association rules are represented as the connections of the judgment nodes. Threshold ai is firstly determined by calculating the mean i and standard deviation si of all attribute values of Ai. Then, initial threshold ai is selected randomly between the interval i - aisi, i + aisi where ai is a parameter to determine the range of the interval. Once the threshold ai is selected for all attributes, each value of the attribute Ai is checked if it is greater than the threshold ai in the judgment nodes of the proposed method.

GNP is an evolutionary computation, which represents its solutions using graph structures and has some useful features inherently. It has been clarified that GNP works well especially in dynamic environments since GNP can create quite compact programs and has an implicit memory function. In this paper, GNP is applied to creating a stock trading model. There are three important points The first important point is to combine GNP with Sarsa Learning which is one of the reinforcement learning algorithms. Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation. In the simulations, the trading model is trained using the stock prices of  brands in ,  and . Then the generalization ability is tested using the stock prices in . From the simulation results, it is clarified that the trading rules of the proposed method obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method and its effectiveness has been confirmed.|Yan Chen,Shingo Mabu,Kotaro Hirasawa,Jinglu Hu","57893|GECCO|2007|A data parallel approach to genetic programming using programmable graphics hardware|In recent years the computing power of graphics cards has increased significantly. Indeed, the growth in the computing power of these graphics cards is now several orders of magnitude greater than the growth in the power of computer processor units. Thus these graphics cards are now beginning to be used by the scientific community aslow cost, high performance computing platforms. Traditional genetic programming is a highly computer intensive algorithm but due to its parallel nature it can be distributed over multiple processors to increase the speed of the algorithm considerably. This is not applicable for single processor architectures but graphics cards provide a mechanism for developing a data parallel implementation of genetic programming. In this paper we will describe the technique of general purpose computing using graphics cards and how to extend this technique to genetic programming. We will demonstrate the improvement in the performance of genetic programming on single processor architectures which can be achieved by harnessing the computing power of these next generation graphics cards.|Darren M.

First, we introduce a visual learning method that uses genetic programming individuals to represent hypotheses. Individuals-hypotheses process image representation composed of visual primitives derived from the training images that contain objects to be recognized. The process of recognition is generative, i.e., an individual is supposed to restore the shape of the processed object by drawing its reproduction on a separate canvas. This canonical method is extended with a knowledge reuse mechanism that allows a learner to import genetic material from hypotheses that evolved for the other decision classes (object classes). We compare the performance of the extended approach to the basic method on a real-world tasks of handwritten character recognition, and conclude that knowledge reuse leads to significant convergence speedup and, more importantly, significantly reduces the risk of overfitting.|Wojciech Jaskowski,Krzysztof Krawiec,Bartosz Wieloch","57930|GECCO|2007|Optimal design of ad hoc injection networks by using genetic algorithms|This work aims at optimizing injection networks, which consist in adding a set of long-range links (called bypass links) in mobile multi-hop ad hoc networks so as to improve connectivity and overcome network partitioning.

This work generally assumes that the size of the market (number of bidders) is known a priori, but that the mechanism designer has no knowledge of the distribution of bid values. However, in many real-world applications (such as online ticket sales), the opposite is true the seller has distributional knowledge of the bid values (e.g., via the history of past transactions in the market), but there is uncertainty about market size. Adopting the perspective of automated mechanism design, introduced by Conitzer and Sandholm, we develop algorithms that compute an optimal, or approximately optimal, online auction mechanism given access to this distributional knowledge. Our main results are twofold. First, we show that when the seller does not know the market size, no constant-approximation to the optimum efficiency or revenue is achievable in the worst case, even under the very strong assumption that bid values are i.i.d. samples from a distribution known to the seller. Second, we show that when the seller has distributional knowledge of the market size as well as the bid values, one can do well in several senses. Perhaps most interestingly, by combining dynamic programming with prophet inequalities (a technique from optimal stopping theory) we are able to design and analyze online mechanisms which are temporally strategyproof (even with respect to arrival and departure times) and approximately efficiency (revenue)-maximizing. In exploring the interplay between automated mechanism design and prophet inequalities, we prove new prophet inequalities motivated by the auction setting.|Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi,Robert D.

In this paper, we suggest an entirely different approach we start with a nave (manipulable) mechanism, and incrementally make it more strategy proof over a sequence of iterations. We give examples of mechanisms that (variants of) our approach generate, including the VCG mechanism in general settings with payments, and the plurality-with-runoff voting rule.

A classic result implies that implementation in dominant strategies is impossible in this model. We first show that a relaxation to Bayes-Nash implementation does not circumvent the problem. We then propose a class of partial revelation mechanisms that achieve approximate dominant strategy implementation, and describe a computationally tractable algorithm for myopically optimizing the partitioning of each agent's type space to reduce manipulability and social welfare loss. This allows for the automated design of one-shot partial revelation mechanisms with worst-case guarantees on both manipulability and efficiency.|Nathanael Hyafil,Craig Boutilier","66095|AAAI|2007|Logic for Automated Mechanism Design - A Progress Report|Over the past half decade, we have been exploring the use of logic in the specification and analysis of computational economic mechanisms.

We first show how to turn a given (e.g., automatically designed using constrained optimization techniques) single-stage mechanism into the most efficient corresponding multistage mechanism given a specified elicitation tree. We then present greedy and dynamic programming (DP) algorithms that determine the elicitation tree (optimal in the DP case).

In this paper we provide a technique for accomplishing this objective. Our technique can deal with a rich class of preferences, including so-called temporally extended preferences (TEPs). Unlike simple preferences which express desired properties of the final state achieved by a plan, TEPs can express desired properties of the entire sequence of states traversed by a plan, allowing the user to express a much richer set of preferences. Our technique involves converting a planning problem with TEPs into an equivalent planning problem containing only simple preferences. This conversion is accomplished by augmenting the inputed planning domain with a new set of predicates and actions for updating these predicates. We then provide a collection of new heuristics and a specialized search algorithm that can guide the planner towards preferred plans. Under some fairly general conditions our method is able to find a most preferred plan-i.e., an optimal plan. It can accomplish this without having to resort to admissible heuristics, which often perform poorly in practice. Nor does our technique require an assumption of restricted plan length or make-span. We have implemented our approach in the HPlan-P planning system and used it to compete in the th International Planning Competition, where it achieved distinguished performance in the Qualitative Preferences track.|Jorge A.

For ambiguous queries, a traditional approach is to organize search results into groups (clusters), one for each meaning of the query. These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate.

The success of such search typically depends on heuristic distance-to-the-goal estimates derived from the plangraph. Such estimates are effective in guiding search for many domains, but there remain many other domains where current heuristics are inadequate to guide forward search effectively. In some of these domains, it is possible to learn reactive policies from example plans that solve many problems. However, due to the inductive nature of these learning techniques, the policies are often faulty, and fail to achieve high success rates. In this work, we consider how to effectively integrate imperfect learned policies with imperfect heuristics in order to improve over each alone. We propose a simple approach that uses the policy to augment the states expanded during each search step. In particular, during each search node expansion, we add not only its neighbors, but all the nodes along the trajectory followed by the policy from the node until some horizon. Empirical results show that our proposed approach benefits both of the leveraged automated techniques, learning and heuristic search, outperforming the state-of-the-art in most benchmark planning domains.|Sung Wook Yoon,Alan Fern,Robert Givan","16510|IJCAI|2007|Hierarchical Heuristic Forward Search in Stochastic Domains|Many MDPs exhibit an hierarchical structure where the agent needs to perform various subtasks that are coupled only by a small sub-set of variables containing, notably, shared resources. Previous work has shown how this hierarchical structure can be exploited by solving several sub-MDPs representing the different subtasks in different calling contexts, and a root MDP responsible for sequencing and synchronizing the subtasks, instead of a huge MDP representing the whole problem. Another important idea used by efficient algorithms for solving flat MDPs, such as (L)AO and (L)RTDP, is to exploit reachability information and an admissible heuristics in order to accelerate the search by pruning states that cannot be reached from a given starting state under an optimal policy. In this paper, we combine both ideas and develop a variant of the AO* algorithm for performing forward heuristic search in hierarchical models. This algorithm shows great performance improvements over hierarchical approaches using standard MDP solvers such as Value Iteration, as well as with respect to AO applied to a flat representation of the problem. Moreover, it presents a general new method for accelerating AO and other forward search algorithms. Substantial performance gains may be obtained in these algorithms by partitioning the set of search nodes, and solving a subset of nodes completely before propagating the results to other subsets.|Nicolas Meuleau,Ronen I.

This opens the way to the development of effective support tools for WSC. Furthermore, we show that if one additionally limits the amount and form of outputs that can be generated, then the set of possible states becomes static, and can be modelled in terms of a standard notion of initial state uncertainty. For this, effective tools exist these can realize scalable WSC with powerful background ontologies.

Further, we show that SATPLAN(P) performances are (almost) always comparable to those of SATPLAN when solving the same problems without preferences in other words, introducing simple preferences in SATPLAN does not affect its performances. This latter result is due both to the particular mechanism we use in order to incorporate preferences in SAT-PLAN and to the relative low number of soft goals (each corresponding to a simple preference) usually present in planning problems. Indeed, if we consider the issue of determining minimal plans (corresponding to problems with thousands of preferences) the performances of SATPLAN(P) are comparable to those of SATPLAN in many cases, but can be significantly worse when the number of preferences is very high compared to the total number of variables in the problem.

In this paper, we present a new efficient algorithm, exploiting dynamic programming and submodularity of the information collected, that efficiently plans data collection tours for an entire (finite) horizon. Our algorithm can use any single step procedure as a black box, and, based on its properties, provides strong theoretical guarantees for the solution.

In this paper we are concerned with developing graph-based unsupervised algorithms for alleviating the data requirements for large scale WSD. Under this framework, finding the right sense for a given word amounts to identifying the most \"important\" node among the set of graph nodes representing its senses. We propose a variety of measures that analyze the connectivity of graph structures, thereby identifying the most relevant word senses.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16764|IJCAI|2007|Belief Change Based on Global Minimisation|A general framework for minimisation-based belief change is presented. A problem instance is made up of an undirected graph, where a formula is associated with each vertex.

We give equivalent semantic and syntactic characterisations of this minimisation. We also show that this approach is general enough to capture existing minimisation-based approaches to belief merging, belief revision, and (temporal) extrapolation operators.

Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

As such, epistemic logics have been employed for the verification of cryptographic protocols. Although this approach to verification is explicitly concerned with changing beliefs, formal belief change operators have not been incorporated in previous work. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to protocol verification by combining a monotonic logic with a non-monotonic belief change operator. In this context, a protocol participant is able to retract beliefs in response to new information and a protocol participant is able to postulate the most plausible event explaining new information. We illustrate that this kind of reasoning is particularly important when protocol participants have incorrect beliefs.|Aaron Hunter,James P.

Domain knowledge about the conditional independence relationships among variables can help learning of the Bayesian Network structure.

Many online solutions for this problem make use of simplifying assumptions, such as Gaussian noise models and linear system behaviour and also adopt a filtering strategy which may not use available information optimally. These assumptions allow near real-time inference, while also limiting accuracy and introducing the potential for ill-conditioning and divergence.

Conventional MCMC techniques applied to this problem can entail significant and time consuming computation to achieve convergence. To address this, we propose an intelligent bootstrapping process and the use of parallel, communicative chains of different temperatures, commonly referred to as parallel tempering.

It is commonly asserted that in order to do so, the agent must be able to learn to deal with unexpected environmental conditions. However an ability to learn is not sufficient. For true extended autonomy, an agent must also be able to recognize when to abandon its current model in favor of learning a new one and how to learn in its current situation.

Past research established the ability of a robot to learn a color map in a single fixed lighting condition when manually given a \"curriculum,\" an action sequence designed to facilitate learning.

The objective is to observe a goal-directed agent and to select assistive actions in order to minimize the overall cost. We model the problem as an assistant POMDP where the hidden state corresponds to the agent's unobserved goals. This formulation allows us to exploit domain models for both estimating the agent's goals and selecting assistive action. In addition, the formulation naturally handles uncertainty, varying action costs, and customization to specific agents via learning. We argue that in many domains myopic heuristics will be adequate for selecting actions in the assistant POMDP and present two such heuristics. We evaluate our approach in two domains where human subjects perform tasks in game-like computer environments.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs).

The approach deals with categorical data, which consists of a set of gene expressionprofiles belonging to one category, and a set belonging to anothercategory. An evolutionary algorithm (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES) is used to learn an ensemble of classification models distinguishing the two categories, based on inputs that are features corresponding to gene expression values. Each feature is associated with a model-based vector, which encodes quantitative information regarding the utilization of the feature across the ensembles of models. Two different ways of constructing these vectors are explored. These model-based vectors are then clustered using a variant of hierarchical clustering called Omniclust. The result is a set of model-based clusters, in which features are gathered together if they are often considered together by classification models -- which may be because they're co-expressed, or may be for subtler reasons involving multi-gene interactions. The method is illustrated by applying it to two datasets regarding human gene expression, one drawn from brain cells and pertinent to the neurogenetics of aging, and the other drawn from blood cells and relating to differentiating between types of lymphoma. We find that, compared to traditional expression-based clustering, the new method often yields clusters that have higher mathematical quality (in the sense of homogeneity and separation) and also yield novel and meaningful insights into the underlying biological processes.|Moshe Looks,Ben Goertzel,L√∫cio de Souza Coelho,Mauricio Mudado,Cassio Pennachin","16613|IJCAI|2007|Learning by Analogy A Classification Rule for Binary and Nominal Data|This paper deals with learning to classify by using an approximation of the analogical proportion between four objects.

The proposed method is based on a hybrid of generative and discriminative approaches to take advantage of both approaches. With our hybrid approach, for each component, we consider an individual generative model trained on labeled samples and a model introduced to reduce the effect of the bias that results when there are few labeled samples. Then, we construct a hybrid classifier by combining all the models based on the maximum entropy principle. In our experimental results using three test collections such as web pages and technical papers, we confirmed that our hybrid approach was effective in improving the generalization performance of multi-component data classification.|Akinori Fujino,Naonori Ueda,Kazumi Saito","16680|IJCAI|2007|Detecting Changes in Unlabeled Data Streams Using Martingale|The martingale framework for detecting changes in data stream, currently only applicable to labeled data, is extended here to unlabeled data using clustering concept. The one-pass incremental changedetection algorithm (i) does not require a sliding window on the data stream, (ii) does not require monitoring the performance of the clustering algorithm as data points are streaming, and (iii) works well for high-dimensional data streams. To enhance the performance of the martingale change detection method, the multiple martingale test method using multiple views is proposed. Experimental results show (i) the feasibility of the martingale method for detecting changes in unlabeled data streams, and (ii) the multiple-martingale test method compares favorably with alternative methods using the recall and precision measures for the video-shot change detection problem.|Shen-Shyang Ho,Harry Wechsler"],["66195|AAAI|2007|The Virtual Solar-Terrestrial Observatory A Deployed Semantic Web Application Case Study for Scientific Research|The Virtual Solar-Terrestrial Observatory is a production semantic web data framework providing access to observational datasets from fields spanning upper atmospheric terrestrial physics to solar physics.

In this paper, we propose a unified approach to these two problems that dynamically models the objects to be manipulated and localizes the robot at the same time. Our approach applies in the common setting where only a lowresolution (cm) grid-map of a building is available, but we also have a high-resolution (.cm) model of the object to be manipulated. Our method is based on defining a unifying probabilistic model over these two representations. The resulting algorithm works in real-time, and estimates the position of objects with sufficient precision for manipulation tasks. We apply our approach to the task of navigating from one office to another (including manipulating doors). Our approach, successfully tested on multiple doors, allows the robot to navigate through a hallway to an office door, grasp and turn the door handle, and continuously manipulate the door as it moves into the office.|Anna Petrovskaya,Andrew Y.

This paper brings contributions to its theory and algorithms. We first unify a well-known top-down decision tree induction algorithm due to Kearns and Mansour, , and discrete AdaBoost Freund and Schapire, , as two versions of a same higher-level boosting algorithm. It may be used as the basic building block to devise simple provable boosting algorithms for complex classifiers. We provide one example the first boosting algorithm for Oblique Decision Trees, an algorithm which turns out to be simpler, faster and significantly more accurate than previous approaches.|Claudia Henry,Richard Nock,Frank Nielsen","57887|GECCO|2007|An application of EDA and GA to dynamic pricing|E-commerce has transformed the way firms develop their pricing strategies, producing shift away from fixed pricing to dynamic pricing.

In particular, we show that this is NP-complete in general Bayesian Games in Standard Normal Form, and that it becomes PP-hard (and, in fixed-precision scenarios, PP-complete), when the game is represented succinctly in General Normal Form. Suitable restrictions in case of graphical games that make the problem tractable are also discussed.|Georg Gottlob,Gianluigi Greco,Toni Mancini","16532|IJCAI|2007|ProbLog A Probabilistic Prolog and Its Application in Link Discovery|We introduce ProbLog, a probabilistic extension of Prolog. A ProbLog program defines a distribution over logic programs by specifying for each clause the probability that it belongs to a randomly sampled program, and these probabilities are mutually independent. The semantics of ProbLog is then defined by the success probability of a query, which corresponds to the probability that the query succeeds in a randomly sampled program. The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of an effective solver for computing success probabilities. It essentially combines SLD-resolution with methods for computing the probability of Boolean formulae. Our implementation further employs an approximation algorithm that combines iterative deepening with binary decision diagrams. We report on experiments in the context of discovering links in real biological networks, a demonstration of the practical usefulness of the approach.|Luc De Raedt,Angelika Kimmig,Hannu Toivonen","65963|AAAI|2007|A New Algorithm for Generating Equilibria in Massive Zero-Sum Games|In normal scenarios, computer scientists often consider the number of states in a game to capture the difficulty of learning an equilibrium. However, players do not see games in the same light most consider Go or Chess to be more complex than Monopoly. In this paper, we discuss a new measure of game complexity that links existing state-of-the-art algorithms for computing approximate equilibria to a more human measure. In particular, we consider the range of skill in a game, i.e. how many different skill levels exist. We then modify existing techniques to design a new algorithm to compute approximate equilibria whose performance can be captured by this new measure. We use it to develop the first near Nash equilibrium for a four round abstraction of poker, and show that it would have been able to win handily the bankroll competition from last year's AAAI poker competition.|Martin Zinkevich,Michael H.

Accurately simulate in real-time complex systems, where a great number of entities interact, requires extensive computational resources and often distribution of the simulation over various computers. A possible solution to these issues is multilevel simulation. This kind of simulation aims at dynamically adapting the level of entities' behaviors (microscopic, macroscopic) while being as faithful as possible to the simulated model. We propose a holonic organizational multilevel model for real-time simulation of complex systems by exploiting the hierarchical and distributed properties of the holarchies. To fully exploit this model, we estimate the deviation of simulation accuracy between two adjacent levels through physics-based indicators. These indicators will then allow us to dynamically determine the most suitable level for each entity in the application to maintain the best compromise between simulation accuracy and available resources. Finally a D real-time multilevel simulation of pedestrians is presented as well as a discussion of experimental results.|Nicolas Gaud,Franck Gechter,St√©phane Galland,Abder Koukam","66232|AAAI|2007|Using AI for e-Government Automatic Assessment of Immigration Application Forms|This paper describes an e-Government AI project that provides a range of intelligent AI services to support automated assessment of various types of applications submitted to an immigration agency.
