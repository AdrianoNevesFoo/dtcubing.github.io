Although support vector machines (SVMs) have been a dominant machine learning technique for the past decade, they have generally been applied to supervised learning problems. Developing unsupervised extensions to SVMs has in fact proved to be difficult. In this paper, we present a principled approach to unsupervised SVM training by formulating convex relaxations of the natural training criterion find a labeling that would yield an optimal SVM classifier on the resulting training data. The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well. While previous work has concentrated on the two-class case, we present a general, multi-class formulation that can be applied to a wider range of natural data sets. The resulting training procedures are computationally intensive, but produce high quality generalization results.|Linli Xu,Dale Schuurmans","16122|IJCAI|2005|Feature Generation for Text Categorization Using World Knowledge|We enhance machine learning algorithms for text categorization with generated features based on domain-specific and common-sense knowledge. This knowledge is represented using publicly available ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, such as the Open Directory these ontologies are further enriched by several orders of magnitude through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the documents alone. Experimental results confirm improved performance, breaking through the plateau previously reached in the field.|Evgeniy Gabrilovich,Shaul Markovitch","16136|IJCAI|2005|Learning Strategies for Open-Domain Natural Language Question Answering|We present an approach to automatically learning strategies for natural language question answering from examples composed of textual sources, questions, and answers.

This framework draws on prior work in learning action and problem-solving strategies, as well as relational learning methods. We describe the design of a system implementing this model in the framework of natural language question answering for story comprehension. Finally, we compare our approach to three prior systems, and present experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of our model.|Eugene Grois,David C.

However, an important open problem in the field is to identify the least restrictive set of assumptions and corresponding algorithms under which learning the optimal network becomes polynomial. In this paper, we present a technique for learning the skeleton of a Bayesian network, called Polynomial Max-Min Skeleton (PMMS), and compare It with Three Phase Dependency Analysis, another state-of-the-art polynomial algorithm. This analysis considers both the theoretical and empirical differences between the two algorithms, and demonstrates PMMS's advantages in both respects. When extended with a greedy hill-climbing Bayesian-scoring search to orient the edges, the novel algorithm proved more time efficient, scalable, and accurate in quality of reconstruction than most state-of-the-art Bayesian network learning algorithms. The results show promise of the existence of polynomial algorithms that are provably correct under minimal distributional assumptions.|Laura E. Brown,Ioannis Tsamardinos,Constantin F.

TimeML--an emerging standard for temporal annotation as a language capturing properties and relationships among timedenoting expressions and events in text--is a good starting point for bridging the gap between temporal analysis of documents and reasoning with the information derived from them. Hard as TimeML-compliant analysis is, the small size of the only currently available annotated corpus makes it even harder. We address this problem with a hybrid TimeML annotator, which uses cascaded finite-state grammars (for temporal expression analysis, shallow syntactic parsing, and feature generation) together with a machine learning component capable of effectively using large amounts of unannotated data.|Branimir Boguraev,Rie Kubota Ando","16317|IJCAI|2005|Sequential Genetic Search for Ensemble Feature Selection|Ensemble learning constitutes one of the main directions in machine learning and data mining. Ensembles allow us to achieve higher accuracy, which is often not achievable with single models. One technique, which proved to be effective for constructing an ensemble of diverse classifiers, is the use of feature subsets. Among different approaches to ensemble feature selection, genetic search was shown to perform best in many domains. In this paper, a new strategy GAS-SEFS, Genetic Algorithmbased Sequential Search for Ensemble Feature Selection, is introduced. Instead of one genetic process, it employs a series of processes, the goal of each of which is to build one base classifier. Experiments on  data sets are conducted, comparing the new strategy with a previously considered genetic strategy for different ensemble sizes and for five different ensemble integration methods. The experiments show that GAS-SEFS, although being more time-consuming, often builds better ensembles, especially on data sets with larger numbers of features.|Alexey Tsymbal,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Padraig Cunningham","65357|AAAI|2005|Robust Supervised Learning|Supervised machine learning techniques developed in the Probably Approximately Correct, Maximum A Posteriori, and Structural Risk Minimiziation frameworks typically make the assumption that the test data a learner is applied to is drawn from the same distribution as the training data. In various prominent applications of learning techniques, from robotics to medical diagnosis to process control, this assumption is violated. We consider a novel framework where a learner may influence the test distribution in a bounded way. From this framework, we derive an efficient algorithm that acts as a wrapper around a broad class of existing supervised learning algorithms while guarranteeing more robust behavior under changes in the input distribution.|J.

Our new method extends a recent advice-giving technique, called Knowledge-Based Kernel Regression (KBKR), that accepts advice concerning a single action of a reinforcement learner. In KBKR, users can say that in some set of states, an action's value should be greater than some linear expression of the current state. In our new technique, which we call Preference KBKR (Pref-KBKR), the user can provide advice in a more natural manner by recommending that some action is preferred over another in the specified set of states. Specifying preferences essentially means that users are giving advice about policies rather than Q values, which is a more natural way for humans to present advice. We present the motivation for preference advice and a proof of the correctness of our extension to KBKR. In addition, we show empirical results that our method can make effective use of advice on a novel reinforcement-learning task, based on the RoboCup simulator, which we call Breakaway. Our work demonstrates the significant potential of advice-giving techniques for addressing complex reinforcement learning problems, while further demonstrating the use of support-vector regression for reinforcement learning.|Richard Maclin,Jude W.

A rough estimate generated quickly is more valuable and useful than a detailed analysis, which might be unnecessary, impractical, or impossible because the situation does not provide enough time, information, or other resources to perform one. Such reasoning is a key component of commonsense reasoning about everyday physical situations. We present an implemented system, BotE-Solver, that can solve about a dozen estimation questions like \"What is the annual cost of healthcare in USA\" from different domains using a library of strategies and the Cyc knowledge base. BotE-Solver is a general-purpose problem solving framework that uses strategies represented as suggestions, and keeps track of problem solving progress in an ANDOR tree. A key contribution of this paper is a knowledge level analysis Newell,  of the strategic knowledge used in BotE reasoning.

This paper proposes two methods that enable the domain expert, who is nonexpert in artificial intelligence (AI), to interactively supervise the knowledge validation process in a CBR system, and to enable dynamic updating of the system, to provide the best diagnostic questions. The first method is based on formal concept analysis which involves a graphical representation and comparison of the concepts, and a summary description highlighting the conceptual differences. We propose a dissimilarity metric for measuring the degree of variation between the previous and current concepts when a new case is added to the knowledge base. The second method involves determining unexpected classification-based association rules to form critical questions as the knowledge base gets updated.|Monica H. Ou,Geoff A. W.

Reasoning here means not only computing subsumption between concepts, and checking satisfiability of the whole knowledge base, but also answering complex queries (in particular, conjunctive queries) over the set of instances maintained in secondary storage. We show that in DL-Lite the usual DL reasoning tasks are polynomial in the size of the TBox, and query answering is polynomial in the size of the ABox (i.e., in data complexity). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of polynomial data complexity for query answering over DL knowledge bases. A notable feature of our logic is to allow for a separation between TBox and ABox reasoning during query evaluation the part of the process requiring TBox reasoning is independent of the ABox, and the part of the process requiring access to the ABox can be carried out by an SQL engine, thus taking advantage of the query optimization strategies provided by current DBMSs.|Diego Calvanese,Giuseppe De Giacomo,Domenico Lembo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Riccardo Rosati","16308|IJCAI|2005|Clinical-Reasoning Skill Acquisition through Intelligent Group Tutoring|This paper describes COMET, a collaborative intelligent tutoring system for medical problembased learning.

We show this methodology in action for the reasoning service previously proposed by Liu, Lakemeyer and Levesque for dealing with disjunctive information. They show that their reasoning is tractable in the propositional case and decidable in the first-order case.

Our solution is to use structural analogy to build probabilistic generalizations about those cases. We use these generalizations as a framework for mapping the structural representations, which are well-suited for reasoning, into features, which are well-suited for learning, and back again. Finally, we demonstrate how probabilistic generalizations are an excellent bridge for joining reasoning and learning by using them to perform a traditional machine learning technique, Bayesian network modeling, over arbitrarily high order structural data about terrorist actions, and further, we discuss how this might be used to facilitate automatic knowledge acquisition.|Daniel T.

This is done by choosing a mechanism that is not strategy-proof but rather strategy-resistant.

A simple way to do this is to choose a random truth assignment A, and then choose clauses randomly from among those satisfied by A. However, this method tends to produce easy problems, since the majority of literals point toward the \"hidden\" assignment A. Last year, (Achlioptas, Jia, & Moore ) proposed a problem generator that cancels this effect by hiding both A and its complement A.

Here we propose a new method to cancel the attraction to A, by choosing a clause with t   literals satisfied by A with probability proportional to qt for some q  . By varying q, we can generate formulas whose variables have no bias, i.e., which are equally likely to be true or false we can even cause the formula to \"deceptively\" point away from A.

Here, we propose a declarative constraint programming framework which we believe combines many strengths of these approaches, while addressing weaknesses in each of them. We formalize our approach as a model extension problem, which is based on the classical notion of extension of a structure by new relations. A parameterized version of this problem captures NP. We discuss properties of the formal framework intended to support effective modelling, and prospects for effective solver design.|David G.

These can be solved interactively by a user assigning values to variables. Explanations for failure in constraint programming tend to focus on conflict. However, what is often desirable is an explanation that is corrective in the sense that it provides the basis for moving forward in the problem-solving process. This paper defines this notion of corrective explanation and demonstrates that a greedy search approach performs very well on a large real-world configuration problem.|Barry O'Sullivan,Barry O'Callaghan,Eugene C.

Solving such NP-complete tasks by \"compilation to SAT\" has turned out to be an approach that is of both practical and theoretical interest. Recently, (Sang et al. ) have shown that state of the art SAT algorithms can be efficiently extended to the harder task of counting the number of models (satisfying assignments) of a formula, by employing a technique called component caching. This paper begins to investigate the question of whether \"compilation to model-counting\" could be a practical technique for solving real-world P-complete problems, in particular Bayesian inference. We describe an efficient translation from Bayesian networks to weighted model counting, extend the best model-counting algorithms to weighted model counting, develop an efficient method for computing all marginals in a single counting pass, and evaluate the approach on computationally challenging reasoning problems.|Tian Sang,Paul Beame,Henry A.

We compare learning on a complex task with three function approximators, a CMAC, a neural network, and an RBF, and demonstrate that behavior transfer works well with all three.

Motion segmentation is a rich source of training data for learning to segment objects by their static image properties. Background subtraction can distinguish between moving objects and their surroundings, and the techniques of statistical machine learning can capture information about objects' shape, size. color, brightness, and texture properties. Presented with a new, static image, the trained model can infer the proper segmentation of the objects present in a scene.

Our new method extends a recent advice-giving technique, called Knowledge-Based Kernel Regression (KBKR), that accepts advice concerning a single action of a reinforcement learner. In KBKR, users can say that in some set of states, an action's value should be greater than some linear expression of the current state. In our new technique, which we call Preference KBKR (Pref-KBKR), the user can provide advice in a more natural manner by recommending that some action is preferred over another in the specified set of states. Specifying preferences essentially means that users are giving advice about policies rather than Q values, which is a more natural way for humans to present advice. We present the motivation for preference advice and a proof of the correctness of our extension to KBKR. In addition, we show empirical results that our method can make effective use of advice on a novel reinforcement-learning task, based on the RoboCup simulator, which we call Breakaway. Our work demonstrates the significant potential of advice-giving techniques for addressing complex reinforcement learning problems, while further demonstrating the use of support-vector regression for reinforcement learning.|Richard Maclin,Jude W.

In most problems of real-world interest, learning this value function requires a function approximator. which represents the mapping from stateaction pairs to values via a concise, parameterized function and uses supervised learning methods to set its parameters. Function approximators make it possible to use temporal difference methods on large problems but, in practice, the feasibility of doing so depends on the ability of the human designer to select an appropriate representation for the value function. My thesis presents a new approach to function approximation that automates some of these difficult design choices by coupling temporal difference methods with policy search methods such as evolutionary computation. It also presents a particular implementation which combines NEAT, a neuroevolutionary policy search method, and Q-learning, a popular temporal difference method, to yield a new method called NEAT+Q that automatically learns effective representations for neural network function approximators. Empirical results in a server job scheduling task demonstrate that NEAT+Q can outperform both NEAT and Q-learning with manually designed neural networks.|Shimon Whiteson","16095|IJCAI|2005|Inferring Image Templates from Classification Decisions|Assuming human image classification decisions are based on estimating the degree of match between a small number of stored internal templates and certain regions of the input images, we present an algorithm which infers observers classification templates from their classification decisions on a set of test images.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs.

Mode estimation addresses this problem by reasoning over declarative models of the physical plant, represented as a factored variant of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), called Probabilistic Concurrent Constraint Automata (PCCA). Previous mode estimation approaches track a set of most likely PCCA state trajectories, enumerating them in order of trajectory probability. Although Best-First Trajectory Enumeration (BFTE) is efficient, ignoring the additional trajectories that lead to the same state can significantly underestimate the true state probability and result in misdiagnosis. This paper introduces an innovative belief approximation technique, called Best-First Belief State Enumeration (BFBSE), that addresses this limitation by computing estimate probabilities directly from the HMM belief state update equations. Theoretical and empirical results show that BFBSE significantly increases estimator accuracy, uses less memory, and requires less computation time when enumerating a moderate number of estimates for the approximate belief state of subsystem sized models.|Oliver B.

A common assumption made by most approaches is that a user either has a single goal in mind, or achieves several goals sequentially. However, in real-world environments, a user often has multiple goals that are concurrently carried out, and a single action can serve as a common step towards multiple goals. In this paper, we formulate the multiple-goal recognition problem and exemplify it in an indoor environment where an RF-based wireless network is available.

VCG mechanisms have received wide attention in the AI community because they are efficient and strategy-proof a special case of the Groves family of mechanisms, VCG mechanisms are the only direct-revelation mechanisms that are allocatively efficient and strategy-proof. Unfortunately, they are only weakly budget-balanced. We consider self-interested agents in a network flow domain, and show that in this domain, it is possible to design a mechanism that is both allocatively-efficient and almost completely budget-balanced. This is done by choosing a mechanism that is not strategy-proof but rather strategy-resistant.

The difficulty is further exacerbated when the agents are in an adversarial relationship, demanding that a robust (i.e. winning) non-stationary policy be rapidly learned and adapted.

The allocator in our model is responsible for the performance of dynamically arriving tasks using a second price reverse auction as the allocation protocol. Since the agents are self-interested (i.e. each agent attempts to maximize its own revenue), previous models concerning cooperative agents aiming for a joint goal are not applicable. Thus the main challenge is to identify a set of equilibrium strategies - a stable solution where no agent can benefit from changing its strategy given the other agents' strategies - for any specific environmental settings. We formulate the model and discuss the difficulty in extracting the agents' equilibrium strategies directly from the model's equations. Consequently we propose an efficient algorithm to accurately approximate the agents' equilibrium strategies. A comparative illustration through simulation of the system performance in a closed and open environments is given, emphasizing the advantage of the allocator operating in the latter environment, reaching results close to those obtained by a central enforceable allocation.|David Sarne,Sarit Kraus","65566|AAAI|2005|OAR A Formal Framework for Multi-Agent Negotiation|In Multi-Agent systems, agents often need to make decisions about how to interact with each other when negotiating over task allocation.

The traditional categorization of self-interested and cooperative agents is unified by adopting a utility view. We illustrate mathematically that the degree of cooperativeness of an agent and the degree of its selfdirectness are not directly related. We also show how OAR can be used to evaluate different negotiation strategies and to develop distributed mechanisms that optimize the performance dynamically.

Given a search cost, the goal of the representative agent is to find the best set of opportunities which fulfills the coalition's demands with the maximum overall utility, to be divided among the coalition members. Given the option of side-payments, this strategy will always be preferred by all coalition members (thus no conflict of interests), regardless of the coalition's payoff division protocol. We analyze the incentive to form such coalitions and extract the optimal search strategy for their representative agents, with a distinction between operating in BC and CC markets. Based on our findings we suggest efficient algorithms to be used by the representative agents for calculating a strategy that maximizes their expected utilities.

Now, since the number of possible coalitions increases exponentially with the number of agents involved, having one agent calculate all the values is inefficient. Given this, we present a novel algorithm for distributing this calculation among agents in cooperative environments. Specifically, by using our algorithm, each agent is assigned some part of the calculation such that the agents' shares are exhaustive and disjoint. Moreover, the algorithm is decentralized, requires no communication between the agents, and has minimal memory requirements. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm we compare it with the only other algorithm available in the literature (due to Shehory and Kraus). This shows that for the case of  agents, the distribution process of our algorithm took .% of the time, the values were calculated using .% of the memory, the calculation redundancy was reduced from  to , and the total number of bytes sent between the agents dropped from  to  (note that for larger numbers of agents, these improvements become exponentially better).|Talal Rahwan,Nicholas R.

This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain.

A main departure from traditional models such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that the PSR-model state is composed entirely of observable quantities. PSRs have recently been extended to a class of models called memory-PSRs (mPSRs) that use both memory of past observations and predictions of future observations in their state representation. Thus, mPSRs preserve the PSR-property of the state being composed of observable quantities while potentially revealing structure in the dynamical system that is not exploited in PSRs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structure captured by mPSRs can be exploited quite naturally for stochastic planning based on value-iteration algorithms. In particular, we adapt the incremental-pruning (IP) algorithm defined for planning in POMDPs to mPSRs.

Here we introduce a new representation for heuristics based on lists of set expressions described using taxonomic syntax. Next, we review the idea of a measure of progress (parmar ), which is any heuristic that is guaranteed to be improvable at every state. We take finding a measure of progress as our learning goal, and describe a simple learning algorithm for this purpose. We evaluate our approach across a range of deterministic and stochastic planning-competition domains. The results show that often greedily following the learned heuristic is highly effective.

This makes such systems particularly interesting because they can tolerate faults, and are able to cope with dynamic environments. We propose the first self stabilizing mechanism for multiagent combinatorial optimization, which works on general networks and stabilizes in a state corresponding to the optimal solution of the optimization problem. Our algorithm is based on dynamic programming, and requires a linear number of messages to find the optimal solution in the absence of faults. We show how our algorithm can be made super-stabilizing, in the sense that while transiting from one stable state to the next, our system preserves the assignments from the previous optimal state, until the new optimal solution is found. We offer equal bounds for the stabilization and the superstabilization time. Furthermore, we describe a general scheme for fault containment and fast response time upon low impact failures. Multiple, isolated failures are handled effectively.

Because in many practical cases, sets of assignments can be represented implicitly and compactly using symbolic techniques such as decision diagrams, the set-based algorithm can compute bounds faster than explicitly searching over individual assignments, while memory explosion can be avoided by limiting the size of the sets. Varying the size of the sets yields a family of algorithms that includes known search and inference algorithms as special cases. Furthermore, experiments on random problems indicate that the approach can lead to significant performance improvements.|Martin Sachenbacher,Brian C.

The classic problem involves allocating trials to the arms of a multiarmed slot machine to maximize the expected sum of rewards. We pose a new variation of the multiarmed bandit--the Max K-Armed Bandit--in which trials must be allocated among the arms to maximize the expected best single sample reward of the series of trials. Motivation for the Max K-Armed Bandit is the allocation of restarts among a set of multistart stochastic search algorithms. We present an analysis of this Max K-Armed Bandit showing under certain assumptions that the optimal strategy allocates trials to the observed best arm at a rate increasing double exponentially relative to the other arms. This motivates an exploration strategy that follows a Boltzmann distribution with an exponentially decaying temperature parameter. We compare this exploration policy to policies that allocate trials to the observed best arm at rates faster (and slower) than double exponentially. The results confirm, for two scheduling domains, that the double exponential increase in the rate of allocations to the observed best heuristic outperfonns the other approaches.|Vincent A.

When it comes to solving a new problem, each of these cases serves as an individual piece of evidence that gives an indication of the solution to that problem.

Past efforts have relied on segmenting the signal sequences by hand, which is both time-consuming and error-prone. In our view, segments should correspond to atomic human activities that enable a goal-recognizer to operate optimally the two are intimately related. In this paper, we present a novel method for building probabilistic activity models at the same time as we segment signal sequences into motion patterns. We model each motion pattern as a linear dynamic model and the transitions between motion patterns as a Markov process conditioned on goals. Our EM learning algorithm simultaneously learns the motion-pattern boundaries and probabilistic models for goals and activities, which in turn can be used to accurately recognize activities in an online phase. A major advantage of our algorithm is that it can reduce the human effort in segmenting and labeling signal sequences.

As an input the planners take a domain description D in action language AL which allows state constraints (non-stratified axioms), together with a set of CNF formulae describing the initial state, and a set of literals representing the goal. We propose two approximations of the transition diagram T defined by D. Both approximations are deterministic transition functions and can be computed efficiently. Moreover they are sound (and sometimes complete) with respect to T. In its search for a plan, an approximation based planner analyses paths of an approximation instead of that of T. CPApc and CPAph are forward, best first search planners based on this idea. We compare them with two state-of-the-art conformant planners, KACMBP and Conformant-FF (CFF), over benchmarks in the literature, and over two new domains. One has large number of state constraints and another has a high degree of incompleteness. Our planners perform reasonably well in benchmark domains and outperform KACMBP and CFF in the first domain while still working well with the second one. Our experimental result shows that having an integral part of a conformant planner to deal with state constraints directly can significantly improve its performance extending a similar claim for classical planners in (Thiebaux.

The system accurately and reliably identifies suspect data and network disruptions, and has decreased the amount of time it takes to identify and troubleshoot sensor, network, and server failures. CORMS AI has proven to be robust, extendable, and cost effective. It is estimated that CORMS AI will save government over one million dollars per year when its full range of quality control monitoring capabilities is implemented.|Haleh Vafaie,Carl Cecere","16155|IJCAI|2005|A Tableaux Decision Procedure for SHOIQ|This paper presents a tableaux decision procedure for SHOIQ, the DL underlying OWL DL.

Artificial intelligence algorithms offer the capability to improve the performance or sensor networks in dynamic environments by minimizing energy utilization while not compromising overall performance. However, they have been used only to a limited extent in sensor networks primarily due to their expensive computing requirements. We describe the use of Markov decision processes for the adaptive control of sensor sampling rates in a sensor network used for human health monitoring. The MDP controller is designed to gather optimal information about the patient's health while guaranteeing a minimum lifetime of the system. At every control step, the MDP controller varies the frequency at which the data is collected according to the criticality of the patient's health at that time. We present a stochastic model that is used to generate the optimal policy offline. In cases where a model of the observed process is not available a-priori. we descrihe a Q-learning technique to learn the control policy, by using a pre-existing master controller. Simulation results that illustrate the performance of the controller are presented.|Anand Panangadan,Syed Muhammad Ali,Ashit Talukder","16188|IJCAI|2005|A Unified Framework of Propositional Knowledge Base Revision and Update Based on State Transition Models|Belief revision and belief update are two of the most basic types of belief change operations. We need to select either revision or update when we accept new information into the current belief, however, such decision making has not been considered. In this paper, we propose a unified framework of revision and update based on state transition models that enable us to do such decision making. This framework provides a hybrid operation of revision and update, called acceptance.|Yasuo Kudo,Tetsuya Murai"],["65411|AAAI|2005|A Computational Model of the Cerebral Cortex|Our current understanding of the primate cerebral cortex (neocortex) and in particular the posterior, sensory association cortex has matured to a point where it is possible to develop a family of graphical models that capture the structure, scale and power of the neocortex for purposes of associative recall, sequence prediction and pattern completion among other functions. Implementing such models using readily available computing clusters is now within the grasp of many labs and would provide scientists with the opportunity to experiment with both hard-wired connection schemes and structure-learning algorithms inspired by animal learning and developmental studies. While neural circuits involving structures external to the neocortex such as the thalamic nuclei are less well understood, the availability of a computational model on which to test hypotheses would likely accelerate our understanding of these circuits. Furthermore, the existence of an agreed-upon cortical substrate would not only facilitate our understanding of the brain but enable researchers to combine lessons learned from biology with state-of-the-art graphical-model and machine-learning techniques to design hybrid systems that combine the best of biological and traditional computing approaches.|Thomas Dean","65398|AAAI|2005|The Max Armed Bandit A New Model of Exploration Applied to Search Heuristic Selection|The multiarmed bandit is often used as an analogy for the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in search problems. The classic problem involves allocating trials to the arms of a multiarmed slot machine to maximize the expected sum of rewards. We pose a new variation of the multiarmed bandit--the Max K-Armed Bandit--in which trials must be allocated among the arms to maximize the expected best single sample reward of the series of trials. Motivation for the Max K-Armed Bandit is the allocation of restarts among a set of multistart stochastic search algorithms. We present an analysis of this Max K-Armed Bandit showing under certain assumptions that the optimal strategy allocates trials to the observed best arm at a rate increasing double exponentially relative to the other arms. This motivates an exploration strategy that follows a Boltzmann distribution with an exponentially decaying temperature parameter. We compare this exploration policy to policies that allocate trials to the observed best arm at rates faster (and slower) than double exponentially. The results confirm, for two scheduling domains, that the double exponential increase in the rate of allocations to the observed best heuristic outperfonns the other approaches.|Vincent A.

The key point of this BDI-model is to express agents' beliefs, desires and intentions as a set of runs (computing paths), which is exactly a system in the interpreted system model, a well-known agent model due to Halpern and his colleagues. Our BDI-model is computationally grounded in that we are able to associate the BDI-agent model with a computer program, and formulas, involving agents' beliefs, desires (goals) and intentions, can be understood as properties of program computations. We present a sound and complete proof system with respect to our BDI-model and explore how symbolic model checking techniques can be applied to model checking BDI-agents. In order to make our BDI-model more flexible and practically realistic, we generalize it so that agents can have multiple sources of beliefs, goals and intentions.|Kaile Su,Abdul Sattar,Kewen Wang,Xiangyu Luo,Guido Governatori,Vineet Padmanabhan","16112|IJCAI|2005|A Simple-Transition Model for Relational Sequences|We use \"nearly sound\" logical constraints to infer hidden states of relational processes. We introduce a simple-transition cost model, which is parameterized by weighted constraints and a statetransition cost. Inference for this model, i.e. finding a minimum-cost state sequence, reduces to a single-state minimization (SSM) problem. For relational Horn constraints, we give a practical approach to SSM based on logical reasoning and bounded search.

Learning using exact inference scales poorly as the number of levels in the hierarchy increases therefore, an approximation is required for large models. We demonstrate that variational inference is well suited to solve this problem. Not only does this technique scale. but it also offers a natural way to leverage the context specific independence properties inherent in the model via the fixed point equations. Experiments confirm that the variational approximation significantly reduces the time necessary for learning while estimating parameter values that can be used to make reliable predictions.|Jeffrey Johns,Sridhar Mahadevan","65424|AAAI|2005|Incremental Estimation of Discrete Hidden Markov Models Based on a New Backward Procedure|We address the problem of learning discrete hidden Markov models from very long sequences of observations.

We introduce an improved incremental Baum-Welch algorithm with a new backward procedure that approximates the -values based on a one-step lookahead in the training sequence. We justify the new approach analytically, and report empirical results that show it converges faster than previous incremental algorithms.|German Florez-Larrahondo,Susan Bridges,Eric A.

We describe methods for estimating the model's parameters in practice and demonstrate experimentally that for UIE the model's log likelihoods are  times better, on average, than those obtained by Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and the noisy-or model used in previous work.

Solving such NP-complete tasks by \"compilation to SAT\" has turned out to be an approach that is of both practical and theoretical interest. Recently, (Sang et al. ) have shown that state of the art SAT algorithms can be efficiently extended to the harder task of counting the number of models (satisfying assignments) of a formula, by employing a technique called component caching. This paper begins to investigate the question of whether \"compilation to model-counting\" could be a practical technique for solving real-world P-complete problems, in particular Bayesian inference. We describe an efficient translation from Bayesian networks to weighted model counting, extend the best model-counting algorithms to weighted model counting, develop an efficient method for computing all marginals in a single counting pass, and evaluate the approach on computationally challenging reasoning problems.|Tian Sang,Paul Beame,Henry A.

However, much of the work on forgetting, and other related approaches such as independence, irrelevance and novelty, has been restricted to the classical logics. This paper describes a detailed theoretical investigation of the notion of forgetting in the context of logic programming. We first provide a semantic definition of forgetting under the answer sets for extended logic programs. We then discuss the desirable properties and some motivating examples. An important result of this study is an algorithm for computing the result of forgetting in a logic program. Furthermore, we present a modified version of the algorithm and show that the time complexity of the new algorithm is polynomial with respect to the size of the given logic program if the size of certain rules is fixed. We show how the proposed theory of forgetting can be used to characterize the logic program updates.|Kewen Wang,Abdul Sattar,Kaile Su","16211|IJCAI|2005|Discovering Classes of Strongly Equivalent Logic Programs|In this paper we apply computer-aided theorem discovery technique to discover theorems about strongly equivalent logic programs under the answer set semantics.

We argue that there are advantages in using an extended folding rule as a reorganizing operator for inductive-inference systems. Such an extended folding rule allows an inductive-inference system not only to recognize already-learned concepts, but also to increase the efficiently of execution of inferred programs.|David A.

We mainly focus on programs with monotone and antimonotone aggregates (LPm,aA programs). We define a new notion of unfounded set for (LPm,aA programs, and prove that it is a sound generalization of the standard notion of unfounded set for aggregate-free programs. We show that the answer sets of an LPm,aA program are precisely its unfounded-free models. We define a well-founded operator WP for LPm,aA programs we prove that its total fixpoints are precisely the answer sets of P, and its least fixpoint WPw() is contained in the intersection of all answer sets (if P admits an answer set). WPW() is efficiently computable, and for aggregate-free programs it coincides with the well-founded model. We carry out an in-depth complexity analysis in the general framework, including also nonmonotone aggregates. We prove that monotone and anti-monotone aggregates do not increase the complexity of cautious reasoning, which remains in co-NP. Nonmonotone aggregates, instead, do increase the complexity by one level in the polynomial hierarchy. Our results allow also to generalize and speed-up ASP systems with aggregates.|Francesco Calimeri,Wolfgang Faber,Nicola Leone,Simona Perri","16316|IJCAI|2005|Ordering Heuristics for Description Logic Reasoning|We present a new architecture for Description Logic implementations, a range of new optimisation techniques and an empirical analysis of their effectiveness.|Dmitry Tsarkov,Ian Horrocks","16160|IJCAI|2005|Equivalence in Abductive Logic|We consider the problem of identifying equivalence of two knowledge bases which are capable of abductive reasoning. Here, a knowledge base is written in either first-order logic or nonmonotonic logic programming. In this work, we will give two definitions of abductive equivalence. The first one, explainable equivalence, requires that two abductive programs have the same explainability for any observation. Another one, explanatory equivalence, guarantees that any observation has exactly the same explanations in each abductive framework. Explanatory equivalence is a stronger notion than explainable equivalence. In first-order abduction, explainable equivalence can be verified by the notion of extensional equivalence in default theories. In nonmonotonic logic programs, explanatory equivalence can be checked by means of the notion of relative strong equivalence. We also show the complexity results for abductive equivalence.|Katsumi Inoue,Chiaki Sakama","16108|IJCAI|2005|Strong Equivalence for Logic Programs with Preferences|Recently, strong equivalence for Answer Set Programming has been studied intensively, and was shown to be beneficial for modular programming and automated optimization.

These results provide a clear picture of the relationship of these semantics with respect to strong equivalence, which differs considerably from their relationship with respect to answer sets.

In this paper we focus on planning with exogenous events that happen at known times, and affect the plan actions by imposing that the execution of certain plan actions must be during some time windows. When actions have durations, handling such constraints adds an extra difficulty to planning, which we address by integrating temporal reasoning into planning. We propose a new approach to planning in domains with durations and time windows, combining graph-based planning and disjunctive constraint-based temporal reasoning.

Additionally, we suggest a general technique to convert any bitonic approximation algorithm for an unweighted domain (where agent values are either zero or one) to a truthful mechanism, with only a small approximation loss. In contrast, we show that even positive results from the \"unknown single minded combinatorial auctions\" literature fail to extend to the \"unknown\" single-value case.

As an input the planners take a domain description D in action language AL which allows state constraints (non-stratified axioms), together with a set of CNF formulae describing the initial state, and a set of literals representing the goal. We propose two approximations of the transition diagram T defined by D. Both approximations are deterministic transition functions and can be computed efficiently. Moreover they are sound (and sometimes complete) with respect to T. In its search for a plan, an approximation based planner analyses paths of an approximation instead of that of T. CPApc and CPAph are forward, best first search planners based on this idea. We compare them with two state-of-the-art conformant planners, KACMBP and Conformant-FF (CFF), over benchmarks in the literature, and over two new domains. One has large number of state constraints and another has a high degree of incompleteness. Our planners perform reasonably well in benchmark domains and outperform KACMBP and CFF in the first domain while still working well with the second one. Our experimental result shows that having an integral part of a conformant planner to deal with state constraints directly can significantly improve its performance extending a similar claim for classical planners in (Thiebaux.

Next, we review the idea of a measure of progress (parmar ), which is any heuristic that is guaranteed to be improvable at every state. We take finding a measure of progress as our learning goal, and describe a simple learning algorithm for this purpose. We evaluate our approach across a range of deterministic and stochastic planning-competition domains. The results show that often greedily following the learned heuristic is highly effective.
