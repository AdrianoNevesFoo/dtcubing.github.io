This technology poses many new challenges on current data management systems. RFID data are time-dependent, dynamically changing, in large volumes, and carry implicit semantics. RFID data management systems need to effectively support such large scale temporal data created by RFID applications. These systems need to have an explicit temporal data model for RFID data to support tracking and monitoring queries. In addition, they need to have an automatic method to transform the primitive observations from RFID readers into derived data used in RFID-enabled applications. In this paper, we present an integrated RFID data management system -- Siemens RFID Middleware -- based on an expressive temporal data model for RFID data. Our system enables semantic RFID data filtering and automatic data transformation based on declarative rules, provides powerful query support of RFID object tracking and monitoring, and can be adapted to different RFID-enabled applications.|Fusheng Wang,Peiya Liu","57327|GECCO|2005|DXCS an XCS system for distributed data mining|XCS is a flexible system for data mining due to its ability to deal with environmental changes, learn online with little prior knowledge and evolve accurate and maximally general classifiers.

To handle these files data processing logic is reinvented inside each application. This results in a jungle of data processing solutions and a jungle of data and file formats. For a user, it is extremely hard to manage information in this jungle. Most of all it is impossible to use data distributed among different files and formats for combined queries, e.g., join and union operations. To solve the problems arising from file based data management, we present a software system called iMeMex as a unified solution to personal information management and integration. iMeMex is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Our system enables existing applications to gradually dispose file based storage.

However, query operators that work with multiple streams, such as stream merge or join, can often still block if one of the input stream is very slow or bursty. In principle, punctuation and heartbeat mechanisms have been proposed to unblock streaming operators. In practice, it is a challenge to incorporate such mechanisms into a high-performance stream management system that is operational in an industrial application.In this paper, we introduce a system for punctuation-carrying heartbeat generation that we developed for Gigascope, a high-performance streaming database for network monitoring, that is operationally used within AT&T's IP backbone. We show how heartbeats can be regularly generated by low-level nodes in query execution plans and propagated upward unblocking all streaming operators on its way. Additionally, our heartbeat mechanism can be used for other applications in distributed settings such as detecting node failures, performance monitoring, and query optimization. A performance evaluation using live data feeds shows that our system is capable of working at multiple Gigabit line speeds in a live, industrial deployment and can significantly decrease the query memory utilization.|Theodore Johnson,S.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

The GP search is structured to generate a set of alternatives that are similar in design performance, but are dissimilar from each other in the solution (or design parameter) space. This is expected to yield potentially more creative designs, thus enhancing design innovation. Application of MCCP is demonstrated through an illustrative example involving GP-based classification of genetic data to diagnose malignancy in cancer. Four different classifiers, based on highly dissimilar combinations of genes, but with similar prediction performances were generated. As these classifiers use a diverse set of genes, they are collectively more effective in screening cancer samples that may not all properly express every gene.|Emily M. Zechman,S.

However, the topological structure of a system may set a limit on the possible robustness achievable through parameter tuning.

As a case study, a methodology for automated synthesis of dynamic systems, based on genetic programming and bond graph modeling (GPBG), is applied to evolve robust low-pass and high-pass analog filters. Compared with a traditional robust design approach based on a state-of-the-art real-parameter genetic algorithm (GA), it is shown that open-ended topology search by genetic programming with a fitness criterion rewarding robustness can evolve more robust systems with respect to parameter perturbations than what was achieved through parameter tuning alone, for our test problems.|Jianjun Hu,Xiwei Zhong,Erik D.

An important class of dynamic problems is the class of tracking problems where an algorithm has to find an approximately optimal solution and insure an almost constant quality in spite of the changing problem. For the application of evolutionary algorithms to static optimization problems, the distribution of the optimization time and most often its expected value are most important. Adopting this perspective a simple tracking problem in the lattice is considered and the performance of a mutation-based evolutionary algorithm is evaluated. For the static case, asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds are proven.

Helping users query alternative \"deep Web\" sources in the same domain (e.g., Books, Airfares) is an important task with broad applications. As a core component of those applications, dynamic query translation (i.e., translating a user's query across dynamically selected sources) has not been extensively explored. While existing works focus on isolated subproblems (e.g., schema matching, query rewriting) to study, we target at building a complete query translator and thus face new challenges ) To complete the translator, we need to solve the predicate mapping problem (i.e., map a source predicate to target predicates), which is largely unexplored by existing works ) To satisfy our application requirements, we need to design a customizable system architecture to assemble various components addressing respective subproblems (i.e., schema matching, predicate mapping, query rewriting). Tackling these challenges, we develop a light-weight domain-based form assistant, which can generally handle alternative sources in the same domain and is easily customizable to new domains. Our experiment shows the effectiveness of our form assistant in translating queries for real Web sources.|Zhen Zhang,Bin He,Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang","80512|VLDB|2005|Semantic Adaptation of Schema Mappings when Schemas Evolve|Schemas evolve over time to accommodate the changes in the information they represent. Such evolution causes invalidation of various artifacts depending on the schemas, such as schema mappings. In a heterogenous environment, where cooperation among data sources depends essentially upon them, schema mappings must be adapted to reflect schema evolution. In this study, we explore the mapping composition approach for addressing this mapping adaptation problem. We study the semantics of mapping composition in the context of mapping adaptation and compare our approach with the incremental approach of Velegrakis et al . We show that our method is superior in terms of capturing the semantics of both the original mappings and the evolution. We design and implement a mapping adaptation system based on mapping composition as well as additional mapping pruning techniques that significantly speed up the adaptation. We conduct comprehensive experimental analysis and show that the composition approach is practical in various evolution scenarios. The mapping language that we consider is a nested relational extension of the second-order dependencies of Fagin et al . Our work can also be seen as an implementation of the mapping composition operator of the model management framework.|Cong Yu,Lucian Popa","57341|GECCO|2005|A low-level hybridization between memetic algorithm and VNS for the max-cut problem|The Max-Cut problem consists of finding a partition of the graph nodes into two subsets, such that the sum of the edge weights having endpoints in different subsets is maximized.

The key finding of the experiments is that if search heuristics are confined to those which are rooted in past experience, or to heuristics which merely generate variety, limited product advance occurs. Notable product fitness advance only occurs when inventor's expectations as to the relative fitness of potential product inventions are incorporated into the model of invention. The results demonstrate the importance of human direction and expectations in invention.

Effective solutions have to be simultaneously spacetime efficient (at each remote monitor site), communication efficient (across the underlying communication network), and provide continuous, guaranteed-quality approximate query answers. In this paper, we propose novel algorithmic solutions for the problem of continuously tracking a broad class of complex aggregate queries in such a distributed-streams setting. Our tracking schemes maintain approximate query answers with provable error guarantees, while simultaneously optimizing the storage space and processing time at each remote site, and the communication cost across the network. They rely on tracking general-purpose randomized sketch summaries of local streams at remote sites along with concise prediction models of local site behavior in order to produce highly communication- and spacetime-efficient solutions. The result is a powerful approximate query tracking framework that readily incorporates several complex analysis queries (including distributed join and multi-join aggregates, and approximate wavelet representations), thus giving the first known low-overhead tracking solution for such queries in the distributed-streams model.|Graham Cormode,Minos N.

However, query operators that work with multiple streams, such as stream merge or join, can often still block if one of the input stream is very slow or bursty. In principle, punctuation and heartbeat mechanisms have been proposed to unblock streaming operators. In practice, it is a challenge to incorporate such mechanisms into a high-performance stream management system that is operational in an industrial application.In this paper, we introduce a system for punctuation-carrying heartbeat generation that we developed for Gigascope, a high-performance streaming database for network monitoring, that is operationally used within AT&T's IP backbone. We show how heartbeats can be regularly generated by low-level nodes in query execution plans and propagated upward unblocking all streaming operators on its way. Additionally, our heartbeat mechanism can be used for other applications in distributed settings such as detecting node failures, performance monitoring, and query optimization. A performance evaluation using live data feeds shows that our system is capable of working at multiple Gigabit line speeds in a live, industrial deployment and can significantly decrease the query memory utilization.|Theodore Johnson,S.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

Individuals in the population compete to participate in the crossovers and mutations occur with a certain probability. Initial experiments demonstrated that our approach could achieve high prediction accuracy in a small amount of computation time.

One of the six genetically evolved lens systems infringed a previously issued patent three contained many of the essential features of the patents, without infringing and the others were non-infringing novel designs that duplicated (or improved upon) the performance specifications contained in the patents. One of the six patents was issued in the st-century. The six designs were created in a substantially similar and routine way, suggesting that the approach used may have widespread utility.

One example are dynamic problems that change with time. An important class of dynamic problems is the class of tracking problems where an algorithm has to find an approximately optimal solution and insure an almost constant quality in spite of the changing problem. For the application of evolutionary algorithms to static optimization problems, the distribution of the optimization time and most often its expected value are most important. Adopting this perspective a simple tracking problem in the lattice is considered and the performance of a mutation-based evolutionary algorithm is evaluated. For the static case, asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds are proven. These results are applied to derive results on the tracking performance for different rates of change.|Thomas Jansen,Ulf Schellbach","57341|GECCO|2005|A low-level hybridization between memetic algorithm and VNS for the max-cut problem|The Max-Cut problem consists of finding a partition of the graph nodes into two subsets, such that the sum of the edge weights having endpoints in different subsets is maximized.

Their major advantage lies in the fact that they are relatively simple to implement while they allow generalizations for a wide range of real world problems. The multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP), which belongs to the class of NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, is one of the variations of the knapsack problem. The MKP has a wide range of real world applications such as cargo loading, selecting projects to fund, budget management, cutting stock, etc. The MKP has been studied quite extensively in the EA community. Due to the constrained nature of the problem, constraint handling techniques gain great importance in the performance of the proposed EA approaches. In this study, the applicability of a generational EA that uses a penalty-based constraint handling technique and a gene locus based, asymmetric, adaptive mutation scheme is explored for the MKP. The effects of the parameters of the explored approach is determined through tests. Further experiments, using large MKP instances from commonly used benchmarks available through the Internet are performed. Comparison tables are given for the performance of the explored approach and other good performing EAs found in literature for the MKP. Results show that performance improves greatly when compared with other penalty-based techniques, but the explored approach is still not the best performer among all. However, unlike the explored technique, the EAs using the other constraint handling techniques require a great amount of extra computational effort and need heuristic information specific to the optimization problem. Based on these observations, and the fact that the performance difference between the explored scheme and the better performers is not too high, research on improving the explored approach is still in progress.|Sima Uyar,G√ºlsen Eryigit","57296|GECCO|2005|Diversity as a selection pressure in dynamic environments|Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are widely used to deal with optimization problems in dynamic environments (DE) .

However, the question of how to combine these three properties effectively is always difficult to solve due to the scaling and aggregation problems. In this paper, a simple addition of ranking method is proposed to handle constrained optimization problems in EAs. In this method, each individual is ranked based on the above three properties separately, resulting in three new properties which are in the same order of magnitude. Simple addition of the three new terms can then be performed and this produces a new global ranking for each individual.

In this paper, we study the problem of estimating selectivities of fuzzy string predicates. We develop a novel technique, called SEPIA, to solve the problem. It groups strings into clusters, builds a histogram structure for each cluster, and constructs a global histogram for the database.

However, most approaches define new languages for querying RDF data, which has the following shortcomings ) They are difficult to integrate with SQL queries used in database applications, and ) They incur inefficiency as data has to be transformed from SQL to the corresponding language data format. This paper proposes a SQL based scheme that avoids these problems. Specifically, it introduces a SQL table function RDFMATCH to query RDF data. The results of RDFMATCH table function can be further processed by SQL's rich querying capabilities and seamlessly combined with queries on traditional relational data. Furthermore, the RDFMATCH table function invocation is rewritten as a SQL query, thereby avoiding run-time table function procedural overheads. It also enables optimization of rewritten query in conjunction with the rest of the query. The resulting query is executed efficiently by making use of B-tree indexes as well as specialized subject-property materialized views. This paper describes the functionality of the RDFMATCH table function for querying RDF data, which can optionally include user-defined rulebases, and discusses its implementation in Oracle RDBMS. It also presents an experimental study characterizing the overhead eliminated by avoiding procedural code at runtime, characterizing performance under various input conditions, and demonstrating scalability using  million RDF triples from UniProt protein and annotation data.|Eugene Inseok Chong,Souripriya Das,George Eadon,Jagannathan Srinivasan","80593|VLDB|2005|WmXML A System for Watermarking XML Data|As increasing amount of data is published in the form of XML, copyright protection of XML data is becoming an important requirement for many applications.

To overcome these challenges, the watermarking scheme has to be based on the usability of data and the underlying semantics like key attributes and functional dependencies.

The reason is that XML query operators are much more complex than relational operators such as table scans and joins. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called COMET, to modeling the cost of XML operators to our knowledge, COMET is the first method ever proposed for addressing the XML query costing problem. As in relational cost estimation, COMET exploits a set of system catalog statistics that summarizes the XML data the set of \"simple path\" statistics that we propose is new, and is well suited to the XML setting. Unlike the traditional approach, COMET uses a new statistical learning technique called \"transform regression\" instead of detailed analytical models to predict the overall cost. Besides rendering the cost estimation problem tractable for XML queries, COMET has the further advantage of enabling the query optimizer to be self-tuning, automatically adapting to changes over time in the query workload and in the system environment. We demonstrate COMET's feasibility by developing a cost model for the recently proposed XNAV navigational operator. Empirical studies with synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets show that COMET can quickly obtain accurate cost estimates for a variety of XML queries and data sets.|Ning Zhang 0002,Peter J.

The algorithm follows the paradigm of threshold algorithms for top-k query processing with a focus on inexpensive sequential accesses to index lists and only a few judiciously scheduled random accesses. The difficulties in applying the existing top-k algorithms to XML data lie in ) the need to consider scores for XML elements while aggregating them at the document level, ) the combination of vague content conditions with XML path conditions, ) the need to relax query conditions if too few results satisfy all conditions, and ) the selectivity estimation for both content and structure conditions and their impact on evaluation strategies. TopX addresses these issues by precomputing score and path information in an appropriately designed index structure, by largely avoiding or postponing the evaluation of expensive path conditions so as to preserve the sequential access pattern on index lists, and by selectively scheduling random accesses when they are cost-beneficial. In addition, TopX can compute approximate top-k results using probabilistic score estimators, thus speeding up queries with a small and controllable loss in retrieval precision.|Martin Theobald,Ralf Schenkel,Gerhard Weikum","80565|VLDB|2005|Why Search Engines are Used Increasingly to Offload Queries from Databases|The development of future search engine technology is no longer limited to free text.

Based on the generic framework of a genetic algorithm, the approach explores the search space of all possible starting locations of the binding site motifs in different target sequences with a population that undergoes evolution. Individuals in the population compete to participate in the crossovers and mutations occur with a certain probability. Initial experiments demonstrated that our approach could achieve high prediction accuracy in a small amount of computation time. A promising advantage of our approach is the fact that the computation time does not explicitly depend on the length of target sequences and hence may not increase significantly when the target sequences become very long.|Dongsheng Che,Yinglei Song,Khaled Rasheed","57499|GECCO|2005|Multiobjective VLSI cell placement using distributed genetic algorithm|Genetic Algorithms have worked fairly well for the VLSI cell placement problem, albeit with significant run times.

By comparing measured amplitudes of diffracted x-rays through protein crystals with and without the heavy atoms, the locations of the heavy atoms can be estimated. Once the locations of the heavy atoms are known, the phases of the diffracted x-rays through the protein crystal can be estimated, which in turn enables the structure of the protein to be estimated. Unfortunately, the key step in this process is the estimation of the locations of the heavy atoms, and this is a multi-modal, non-linear inverse problem. We report results of a pilot study that show that a -stage hybrid algorithm, using a stochastic genetic algorithm for stage  followed by a deterministic pattern search algorithm for stage , can successfully locate up to  heavy atoms in computer simulated crystals using noise free data.

This paper concerns applying a DE-based algorithm to training Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks with variables including centres, weights, and widths of RBFs. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps the first step is the initial tuning, which focuses on searching for the center, weight, and width of a one-node RBF network, the second step is the local tuning, which optimizes the three variables of the one-node RBF network --- its centre, weight, and width, and the third step is the global tuning, which optimizes all the parameters of the whole network together. The second step and the third step both use the cycling scheme to find the parameters of RBF network. The Mean Square Error from the desired to actual outputs is applied as the objective function to be minimized. Training the networks is demonstrated by approximating a set of functions, using different strategies of DE.

The aim is twofold () to allow infeasible solutions with a promising value of the objective function to remain in the population and also () to increase the probabilities of an individual to generate a better offspring while promoting collaboration of all the population to generate better solutions. These goals are achieved by allowing each parent to generate more than one offspring. The best offspring is selected using a comparison mechanism based on feasibility and this child is compared against its parent. To maintain diversity, the proposed approach uses a mechanism successfully adopted with other evolutionary algorithms where, based on a parameter Sr a solution (between the best offspring and the current parent) with a better value of the objective function can remain in the population, regardless of its feasibility.

In this work, we will analyze whether morphing methods between two shapes can be used as recombination operators acting on the phenotype space, thus directly on the shape or design.

As the exponentiation factor (inverse temperature) of the Boltzmann distribution is increased, probability is increasingly concentrated on the set of optimal points. We show that for fitness functions of k-bounded epistasis that satisfy an additional property called the running intersection property, an explicit computable exact factorization of the Boltzmann distribution with an arbitrary exponentiation factor can be constructed. This factorization allows the Boltzmann distribution to be efficiently sampled, which leads to an algorithm which finds the optimum with high probability.|Alden H.

The NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method is first used to evolve a neural network driver that can autonomously navigate a track without crashing. The network is subsequently impaired, resulting in a driver that occasionally makes mistakes and crashes. Using this impaired driver, a crash predictor is evolved that can predict how far in the future a crash is going to occur, information that can be used to generate an appropriate warning level. The main result is that NEAT can successfully evolve a warning system that takes into account the recent history of inputs and outputs, and therefore makes few errors. Experiments were also run to compare training offline from previously collected data with training online in the simulator. While both methods result in successful warning systems, offline training is both faster and more accurate. Thus, the results in this paper set the stage for developing crash predictors that are both accurate and able to adapt online, which may someday save lives in real vehicles.|Kenneth O.

PSYCHO allows the user to (i) use standard pattern types or define new ones (ii) generate or import patterns, represented according to existing standards (iii) manipulate possibly heterogeneous patterns under an integrated environment.|Barbara Catania,Anna Maddalena,Maurizio Mazza","57445|GECCO|2005|A first order logic classifier system|Motivated by the intention to increase the expressive power of learning classifier systems, we developed a new Xcs derivative, Fox-cs, where the classifier and observation languages are a subset of first order logic. We found that Fox-cs was viable at tasks in two relational task domains, poker and blocks world, which cannot be represented easily using traditional bit-string classifiers and inputs. We also found that for these tasks, the level of generality obtained by Fox-cs in the portion of population that produces optimal behaviour is consistent with Wilson's generality hypothesis.|Drew Mellor","57364|GECCO|2005|Performance assessment of an artificial immune system multiobjective optimizer by two improved metrics|In this study, we introduce two improved assessment metrics of multiobjective optimizers, Nondominated Ratio and Spacing Distribution, and analyze their rationality and validity. Based on the concept of Immunodominance and Antibody Clonal Selection Theory, a novel multiobjective optimization algorithm, Immune Dominance Clonal Multiobjective Algorithm (IDCMA), is put forward. The simulation comparisons between IDCMA and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm show that IDCMA has the best performance in popular metrics such as Spacing, Coverage of Two Sets and the two new metrics presented in this paper when low-dimensional multiobjective problems are concerned. The statistical results of the four metrics also show that Spacing Distribution conquers some limitations of Spacing triumphantly, and Nondominated Ratio conquers the limitation of Coverage of Two Sets that only compared between two sets.|Maoguo Gong,Licheng Jiao,Haifeng Du,Ronghua Shang,Bin Lu","57366|GECCO|2005|An artificial immune system algorithm for CDMA multiuser detection over multi-path channels|Based on the Antibody Clonal Selection Theory of immunology, we put forward a novel clonal selection algorithm for multiuser detection in Code-division Multiple-access Systems. By using the clonal selection operator, the new algorithm can carry out the global search and the local search in many directions rather than one direction around the same individual simultaneously. After discussing the main characters of the new algorithm, especially the convergence and complexity, the performance of the proposed receiver, named by CAMUD, is evaluated via computer simulations and compared to that of other suboptimal schemes as well as to that of Optimal Multiuser detector (OMD) and conventional detector in CDMA systems over Multi-Path Channels. When compared with the OMD scheme, the CAMUD is capable of reducing the computational complexity significantly. On the other hand, when compared with standard genetic algorithm and improved genetic algorithm, theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations show that the CAMUD with same complexity has optimal performance in eliminating MAI and \"near-far\" resistance. The simulations also show that the CAMUD performs quite well even when the number of active users and the length of the transmitted packet are considerably large.|Maoguo Gong,Ling Wang,Licheng Jiao,Haifeng Du","57435|GECCO|2005|The compact classifier system motivation analysis and first results|This paper presents an initial analysis of how maximally general and accurate rules can be evolved in a Pittsburgh-style classifier system. In order to be able to perform such analysis we introduce a simple bare-bones Pittsburgh classifier systems---the compact classifier system (CCS)---based on estimation of distribution algorithms. Using a common rule encoding scheme of Pittsburgh classifier systems, CCS maintains a dynamic set of probability vectors that compactly describe a rule set. The compact genetic algorithm is used to evolve each of the initially perturbed probability vectors which represents the rules. Results show how CCS is able to evolve in a compact, simple, and elegant manner rule sets composed by maximally general and accurate rules.|Xavier Llor√†,Kumara Sastry,David E. Goldberg"]]}}
