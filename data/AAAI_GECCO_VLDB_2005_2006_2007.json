The overshooting problem is a phenomenon in PSO due to the velocity update mechanism of PSO. While the overshooting problem occurs, particles may be led to wrong or opposite directions against the direction to the global optimum. As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm. The experimental results indicate that MeSwarm outperforms the standard PSO and several evolutionary algorithms in terms of solution quality.|Bo-Fu Liu,Hung-Ming Chen,Jian-Hung Chen,Shiow-Fen Hwang,Shinn-Ying Ho","57699|GECCO|2006|Rotated test problems for assessing the performance of multi-objective optimization algorithms|This paper presents four rotatable multi-objective test problems that are designed for testing EMO (Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization) algorithms on their ability in dealing with parameter interactions. Such problems can be solved efficiently only through simultaneous improvements to each decision variable. Evaluation of EMO algorithms with respect to this class of problem has relevance to real-world problems, which are seldom separable. However, many EMO test problems do not have this characteristic. The proposed set of test problems in this paper is intended to address this important requirement. The design principles of these test problems and a description of each new test problem are presented.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa","57479|GECCO|2005|Evolutionary optimization of dynamic control problems accelerated by progressive step reduction|In this paper, we describe the use of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to solve dynamic control optimization problems in engineering.

Amongst optimisation algorithms driven by evolutionary computation techniques,particle swarm algorithms have proven to be a very good alternative to genetic algorithms because of their faster convergence. However they can still suffer from premature convergence to local optima. Premature convergence occurs when the particles of the swarm are too close to each other to enable further exploration of the space. To put it another way, the dispersion or distribution of the swarm throughout the search space has been localised to a small region with a consequent stagnation of the search process. Many strategies have been used to try to prevent convergence to a local optimum. However little work has been done on problems of high dimensions. By high dimensions, we mean dimensions of  and above.This paper focuses, therefore, on the limitations of classical particle swarm algorithms when dealing with high dimensional problems. We compare different versions of Particle Swarm Algorithms GBest, LBest with ringor random neighbourhood of size citeClerc, and GCPSOciteVanDenBergh. Those algorithmswere run twice, with a linearly decreasing inertia weight, and with the use of a constriction factor.We also used two repulsive-based algorithms Charged PSOciteBlackwell and Predator PreyciteSilva.Our main focus is problems of high dimensionality. In particular, we applied the different algorithmsto the benchmarks functions Ackley and Rosenbrock, in the following dimensions , , .Even though these represent problems of relatively small dimensionality in a real-world context,experiments on higher dimensions have not been necessary to show the limits of the algorithms studied.Each experiment was run  times. The swarm size was chosen from $    $ and so that it isnot greater than the problem size. Each experiment is  iterations long.A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the performance of each algorithms. We found that the LBest algorithms perform significantly better when used with the constriction factor.GBest and GCPSO perform better with linearly decreasing inertia with a small swarm size, but better with the constriction factorwith a big swarm size. The improvement of GCPSO on GBest is not statistically significant in our experiments. The LBest algorithms with the constriction factor seem to be the best algorithms to handle problems of high dimensionality. The LBest algorithm with fixed neighbourhood seems to be less sensitive to the size of the swarm than the LBest algorithm with randomneighbourhood. Especially, in the case of the Rosenbrock function of size , increasing the sizeof the swarm does not improve the performance of LBest with constricted factor and fixed neighbourhood.The algorithms based on repulsion between particles, i.e. Charged Swarm and Predator Prey, do not perform very well.Indeed, even if the predator prey algorithm gives quite good results, it is trapped in a local optimum, as the fitness value stagnates on a constant value for the last % of iterations. This may come from a too low levelof repulsion. Tuning the parameters used for repulsion seems to be very important for high dimensionality problems. Experiments show that almost all the algorithms managed to solve the problems for dimension  butnone of the algorithms managed to solve the problem in the case of problems of dimension  and . The LBest algorithm with random neighbourhood and constriction factor performed the best. Further work will be done on modelling the size of the swarm required to be able to solve the problems. Other particle swarm algorithms will also be included.|Sébastien Piccand,Michael O'Neill,Jacqueline Walker"],["66171|AAAI|2007|Authorial Idioms for Target Distributions in TTD-MDPs|In designing Markov Decision Processes (MDP), one must define the world, its dynamics, a set of actions, and a reward function. MDPs are often applied in situations where there is a clear choice of reward functions and in these cases significant care must be taken to construct a reward function that induces the desired behavior. In this paper, we consider an analogous design problem crafting a target distribution in Targeted Trajectory Distribution MDPs (TTD-MDPs). TTD-MDPs produce probabilistic policies that minimize divergence from a target distribution of trajectories from an underlying MDP. They are an extension of MDPs that provide variety of experience during repeated execution. Here, we present a brief overview of TTD-MDPs with approaches for constructing target distributions. Then we present a novel authorial idiom for creating target distributions using prototype trajectories. We evaluate these approaches on a drama manager for an interactive game.|David L.

Unfortunately, even approximate planning in POMDPs is known to be hard, and developing heuristic planners that can deliver reasonable results in practice has proved to be a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to approximate value-iteration for POMDP planning that is based on quadratic rather than piecewise linear function approximators. Specifically, we approximate the optimal value function by a convex upper bound composed of a fixed number of quadratics, and optimize it at each stage by semidefinite programming. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive approximation quality to current techniques while still maintaining a bounded size representation of the function approximator. Moreover, an upper bound on the optimal value function can be preserved if required. Overall, the technique requires computation time and space that is only linear in the number of iterations (horizon time).|Tao Wang,Pascal Poupart,Michael H.

Brafman","66217|AAAI|2007|Purely Epistemic Markov Decision Processes|Planning under uncertainty involves two distinct sources of uncertainty uncertainty about the effects of actions and uncertainty about the current state of the world. The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","65906|AAAI|2006|Point-based Dynamic Programming for DEC-POMDPs|We introduce point-based dynamic programming (DP) for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDPs), a new discrete DP algorithm for planning strategies for cooperative multi-agent systems.

Existing approaches that solve Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) suffer from the fact that they can only solve relatively small problems without complex constraints on task execution. OC-DEC-MDP has been introduced to deal with large DEC-MDPs under resource and temporal constraints. However, the proposed algorithm to solve this class of DEC-MDPs has some limits it suffers from overestimation of opportunity cost and restricts policy improvement to one sweep (or iteration). In this paper, we propose to overcome these limits by first introducing the notion of Expected Opportunity Cost to better assess the influence of a local decision of an agent on the others. We then describe an iterative version of the algorithm to incrementally improve the policies of agents leading to higher quality solutions in some settings. Experimental results are shown to support our claims.|Aurélie Beynier,Abdel-Illah Mouaddib","65933|AAAI|2006|Hard Constrained Semi-Markov Decision Processes|In multiple criteria Markov Decision Processes (MDP) where multiple costs are incurred at every decision point, current methods solve them by minimising the expected primary cost criterion while constraining the expectations of other cost criteria to some critical values. However, systems are often faced with hard constraints where the cost criteria should never exceed some critical values at any time, rather than constraints based on the expected cost criteria. For example, a resource-limited sensor network no longer functions once its energy is depleted. Based on the semi-MDP (sMDP) model, we study the hard constrained (HC) problem in continuous time, state and action spaces with respect to both finite and infinite horizons, and various cost criteria. We show that the HCsMDP problem is NP-hard and that there exists an equivalent discrete-time MDP to every HCsMDP.

In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs. It is also robust and bears negligible computational overhead.|Yi-Cheng Tu,Song Liu,Sunil Prabhakar,Bin Yao"],["65605|AAAI|2005|Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Multi-Class Support Vector Machines|We present new unsupervised and semi-supervised training algorithms for multi-class support vector machines based on semidefinite programming.

Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win.

Unfortunately, even approximate planning in POMDPs is known to be hard, and developing heuristic planners that can deliver reasonable results in practice has proved to be a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to approximate value-iteration for POMDP planning that is based on quadratic rather than piecewise linear function approximators. Specifically, we approximate the optimal value function by a convex upper bound composed of a fixed number of quadratics, and optimize it at each stage by semidefinite programming. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive approximation quality to current techniques while still maintaining a bounded size representation of the function approximator. Moreover, an upper bound on the optimal value function can be preserved if required. Overall, the technique requires computation time and space that is only linear in the number of iterations (horizon time).|Tao Wang,Pascal Poupart,Michael H.

MDPs are often applied in situations where there is a clear choice of reward functions and in these cases significant care must be taken to construct a reward function that induces the desired behavior. In this paper, we consider an analogous design problem crafting a target distribution in Targeted Trajectory Distribution MDPs (TTD-MDPs). TTD-MDPs produce probabilistic policies that minimize divergence from a target distribution of trajectories from an underlying MDP. They are an extension of MDPs that provide variety of experience during repeated execution. Here, we present a brief overview of TTD-MDPs with approaches for constructing target distributions. Then we present a novel authorial idiom for creating target distributions using prototype trajectories. We evaluate these approaches on a drama manager for an interactive game.|David L.

During object manipulation, object dynamics can be extremely complex, non-linear and challenging to specify. To avoid modeling the full complexity of possible dynamics. I instead use a model which switches between a discrete number of simple dynamics models. By learning these models and extending Porta's continuous state POMDP framework (Porta et at. ) to incorporate this switching dynamics model, we hope to handle tasks that involve absolute and relative dynamics within a single framework.

The most widely developed model that deals with both sources of uncertainty is that of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Simplifying POMDPs by getting rid of the second source of uncertainty leads to the well-known framework of fully observable MDPs. Getting rid of the first source of uncertainty leads to a less widely studied framework, namely, decision processes where actions cannot change the state of the world and are only intended to bring some information about the (static) state of the world. Such \"purely epistemic\" processes are very relevant, since many practical problems (such as diagnosis, database querying, or preference elicitation) fall into this class. However, it is not known whether this specific restriction of POMDP is computationally simpler than POMDPs. In this paper we establish several complexity results for purely epistemic MDPs (EMDPs). We first show that short-horizon policy existence in EMDPs is PSPACE-complete. Then we focus on the specific case of EMDPs with reliable observations and show that in this case, policy existence is \"only\" NP-complete however, we show that this problem cannot be approximated with a bounded performance ratio by a polynomial-time algorithm.|Régis Sabbadin,Jérôme Lang,Nasolo Ravoanjanahry","66182|AAAI|2007|Situated Conversational Agents|A Situated Conversational Agent (SCA) is an agent that engages in dialog about the context within which it is embedded.

This paper describes initial research into the construction of an SCA that engages in dialog about collaborative physical tasks, in which agents engage in dialog with the joint goal of manipulating the physical context in some manner. Constructing an SCA that can interact naturally in such tasks requires an agent with the ability to interleave planning, action, and observation while operating in a partially observable environment. Consequently, I propose to model an SCA as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).|William Thompson","66009|AAAI|2007|Scaling Up Solving POMDPs through Value Based Clustering|Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide an appropriately rich model for agents operating under partial knowledge of the environment.

In the case of anthrax attack, a delay of hours in making a right decision can lead to hundreds of lives lost. Current detection methods trade off reliability of alarms for early detection of outbreaks. The performance of these methods can be improved by modem disease-specific modeling techniques which take into account the potential costs and effects of an attack to provide optimal warnings. We study this optimization problem in the reinforcement learning framework. The key contribution of this paper is to apply Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) on outbreak detection mechanism for improving alarm function in anthrax outbreak detection. Our approach relies on estimating the future benefit of true alarms and the costs of false alarms and using these quantities to identify an optimal decision. We present empirical evidence illustrating that the performance of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and timeliness is improved significantly by utilizing POMDPs.|Masoumeh T.

Phases are introduced into a model to represent relevant execution history, but there is no physical manifestation of phases in the real world. We treat phases as partially observable state features and show how a belief distribution over phase configurations can be derived from observable state features through the use of transient analysis for Markov chains. This results in an efficient method for phase tracking during execution that can be combined with the QMDP value method for POMDPs to make action choices.

Performance on a job-shop scheduling problem is evaluated empirically with and without gene libraries, and with many different library configurations. We propose that gene libraries encourage diversity in a population of solutions and that the number of components in the gene library parameterises this effect. The number of gene libraries used is found to affect solution fitness and indeed using larger numbers of libraries (and therefore libraries of smaller components) enables higher fitness to be attained. We conclude that gene libraries are likely to be of use in applications where there is a need to maintain the diversity of solutions.|Peter Spellward,Tim Kovacs","80537|VLDB|2005|A Heartbeat Mechanism and Its Application in Gigascope|Data stream management systems often rely on ordering properties of tuple attributes in order to implement non-blocking operators.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals.

We consider how to build large pattern databases that are stored in external memory, such as disk, and how to use an external-memory pattern database efficiently in heuristic search. To limit the number of slow disk IO operations needed to construct and query an external-memory pattern data-base, we adapt an approach to external-memory graph search called structured duplicate detection that localizes memory references by leveraging an abstraction of the state space. We present results that show this approach increases the scalability of heuristic search by allowing larger and more accurate pattern database heuristics.|Rong Zhou,Eric A.

Core BP optimization problem means developing a BP loading map for a given core loading configuration that minimizes the total Gadolinium (Gd) amount in the core without violating any design constraints. The number of UOGdO pins and GdO concentrations for each fresh fuel location in the core are the decision variables and the total amount of the Gd in the core is in the objective function. The main objective is to develop the BP loading pattern to minimize the total Gd in the core together with the with residual binding at End-of-Cycle (EOC) and to keep the maximum peak pin power and Soluble Boron Concentration (SOB) at the Beginning of Cycle (BOC) both less than their limit values during core depletion. The innovation of this study was to search all of the feasible UGd fuel assembly designs with variable number of UGd pins and concentration of GdO in the overall decision space. The use of different fitness functions guides the solution towards desired (good solutions) region in the solution space, which accelerates the GA solution. The main objective of this study was to develop a practical and efficient GA tool and to apply this tool for designing BP patterns of a given core loading.|Serkan Yilmaz,Kostadin Ivanov,Samuel Levine","66102|AAAI|2007|Best-First ANDOR Search for Graphical Models|The paper presents and evaluates the power of best-first search over ANDOR search spaces in graphical models. The main virtue of the ANDOR representation is its sensitivity to the structure of the graphical model, which can translate into significant time savings. Indeed, in recent years depth-first ANDOR Branch-and-Bound algorithms were shown to be very effective when exploring such search spaces, especially when using caching. Since best-first strategies are known to be superior to depth-first when memory is utilized, exploring the best-first control strategy is called for. In this paper we introduce two classes of best-first ANDOR search algorithms those that explore a context-minimal ANDOR search graph and use static variable orderings, and those that use dynamic variable orderings but explore an ANDOR search tree. The superiority of the best-first search approach is demonstrated empirically on various real-world benchmarks.|Radu Marinescu 0002,Rina Dechter","65351|AAAI|2005|The Achilles Heel of QBF|In recent years we have seen significant progress in the area of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving and its applications. As a new challenge, the community is now moving to investigate whether similar advances can be made in the use of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). QBF provides a natural framework for capturing problem solving and planning in multi-agent settings. However, contrarily to single-agent planning, which can be effectively formulated as SAT, we show that a QBF approach to planning in a multi-agent setting leads to significant unexpected computational difficulties. We identify as a key difficulty of the QBF approach the fact that QBF solvers often end up exploring a much larger search space than the natural search space of the original problem. This is in contrast to the experience with SAT approaches. We also show how one can alleviate these problems by introducing two special QBF formulations and a new QBF solution strategy. We present experiments that show the effectiveness of our approach in terms of a significant improvement in performance compared to earlier work in this area. Our work also provides a general methodology for formulating adversarial scenarios in QBF.|Carlos Ansótegui,Carla P.

We develop a new genetic algorithm hybridized with an innovative local search procedure (bottleneck shifting) for the fJSP problem. The genetic algorithm uses two representation methods to represent solutions of the fJSP problem. Advanced crossover and mutation operators are proposed to adapt to the special chromosome structures and the characteristics of the problem. The bottleneck shifting works over two kinds of effective neighborhood, which use interchange of operation sequences and assignment of new machines for operations on the critical path. In order to strengthen the search ability, the neighborhood structure can be adjusted dynamically in the local search procedure. The performance of the proposed method is validated by numerical experiments on several representative problems.|Jie Gao,Mitsuo Gen,Linyan Sun","57790|GECCO|2006|How an optimal observer can collapse the search space|Many metaheuristics have difficulty exploring their search space comprehensively. Exploration time and efficiency are highly dependent on the size and the ruggedness of the search space. For instance, the Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) is not totally suited to traverse very large landscapes, especially deceptive ones. The approach introduced here aims at improving the exploration process of the SGA by adding a second search process through the way the solutions are coded. An \"observer\" is defined as each possible encoding that aims at reducing the search space. Adequacy of one observer is computed by applying this specific encoding and evaluating how this observer is beneficial for the SGA run. The observers are trained for a specific time by a second evolutionary stage. During the evolution of the observers, the most suitable observer helps the SGA to find a solution to the tackled problem faster. These observers aim at collapsing the search space and smoothing its ruggedness through a simplification of the genotype. A first implementation of this general approach is proposed, tested on the Shuffled Hierarchical IF-and-only-iF (SHIFF) problem.

This identification problem is challenging because such motifs are usually weakly conserved due to evolutionary variation. Exhaustive search is intractable for finding long motifs because the combinatorial growth of the search space is exponential, thus heuristic methods are preferred. In this paper, we propose the Genetic Algorithm with Local Filtering (GALF) to address the problem, which combines and utilizes both position-led and consensus-led representations in present GA approaches. While position-led representation provides flexibility to move around the search space, it is likely to contain some \"false positive\" sites within an individual. This problem can be overcome by our local filtering operator, which employs consensus-led representation, while it needs less computation than alignments used in conventional consensus-led approaches. Thus both efficiency and accuracy can be achieved. The experimental results on real biological data show that our method can identify TFBSs more accurately and efficiently than other methods including GA-based ones, and is able to deal with relaxed motif widths with superior correctness.|Tak-Ming Chan,Kwong-Sak Leung,Kin-Hong Lee"],["65985|AAAI|2007|A Modal Logic for Beliefs and Pro Attitudes|Agents' pro attitudes such as goals, intentions, desires, wishes, and judgements of satisfactoriness play an important role in how agents act rationally. To provide a natural and satisfying formalization of these attitudes is a longstanding problem in the community of agent theory. Most of existing modal logic approaches are based on Kripke structures and have to face the so-called side-effect problem. This paper presents a new modal logic formalizing agents' pro attitudes, based on neighborhood models. There are three distinguishing features of this logic. Firstly, this logic naturally satisfies Bratman's requirements for agents' beliefs and pro attitudes, as well as some interesting properties that have not been discussed before. Secondly, we give a sound and complete axiom system for characterizing all the valid properties of beliefs and pro attitudes. We introduce for the first time the notion of linear neighborhood frame for obtaining the semantic model, and this brings a new member to the family of non-normal modal logics. Finally, we argue that the present logic satisfies an important requirement proposed from the viewpoint of computation, that is, computational grounding, which means that properties in this logic can be given an interpretation in terms of some concrete computational model.

However, in practice, it oftentimes generates a lot of rules, which lower the readability of the evolved classification model, and thus, people may not be able to get the desired knowledge or useful information out of the model. Inspired by the fault tolerance mechanism proposed in field of data mining, we devise a new XCS framework by integrating the concept and mechanism of fault tolerance into XCS in order to reduce the number of classification rules and therefore to improve the readability of the generated prediction model. A series of $N$-multiplexer experiments, including -bit, -bit, -bit, and -bit multiplexers, are conducted to examine whether XCSFT can accomplish its goal of design.

Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time. The proposed fast matching scheme also fits in any other LCS other than XCS.|Xavier Llorà,Kumara Sastry","65390|AAAI|2005|Learning Support Vector Machines from Distributed Data Sources|In this paper we address the problem of learning Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers from distributed data sources.

It is well known that, across all possible problems, one algorithm is no better than any other. Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

In this paper, we propose novel algorithmic solutions for the problem of continuously tracking a broad class of complex aggregate queries in such a distributed-streams setting. Our tracking schemes maintain approximate query answers with provable error guarantees, while simultaneously optimizing the storage space and processing time at each remote site, and the communication cost across the network. They rely on tracking general-purpose randomized sketch summaries of local streams at remote sites along with concise prediction models of local site behavior in order to produce highly communication- and spacetime-efficient solutions. The result is a powerful approximate query tracking framework that readily incorporates several complex analysis queries (including distributed join and multi-join aggregates, and approximate wavelet representations), thus giving the first known low-overhead tracking solution for such queries in the distributed-streams model.|Graham Cormode,Minos N.

We develop this idea for the evaluation of boolean XPath queries over a tree that is fragmented, both horizontally and vertically over a number of sites. The key idea is to send the whole query to each site which partially evaluates, in parallel, the query and sends the results as compact boolean functions to a coordinator which combines these to obtain the result. This approach has several advantages. First, each site is visited only once, even if several fragments of the tree are stored at that site. Second, no prior constraints on how the tree is decomposed are needed, nor is any structural information about the tree required, such as a DTD. Third, there is a satisfactory bound on the total computation performed on all sites and on the total network traffic. We also develop a simple incremental maintenance algorithm that requires communication only with the sites at which changes have taken place moreover the network traffic depends neither on the data nor on the update.

Traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness of answer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes, even if they wind up being relevant to a user query. Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such possible answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being pertinent answers to the query. The autonomous nature of web databases poses several challenges in realizing this objective. Such challenges include the restricted access privileges imposed on the data, the limited support for query patterns, and the bounded pool of database and network resources in the web environment. We introduce a novel query rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges. Our technique involves reformulating the user query based on mined correlations among the database attributes. The reformulated queries are aimed at retrieving the relevant possible answers in addition to the certain answers. QPIAD is able to gauge the relevance of such queries allowing tradeoffs in reducing the costs of database query processing and answer transmission. To support this framework, we develop methods for mining attribute correlations (in terms of Approximate Functional Dependencies), value distributions (in the form of Na&iumlve Bayes Classifiers), and selectivity estimates.

Previous work has focused on how to move query operators dynamically in reaction to load changes in order to keep the load balanced. Operator movement is too expensive to alleviate short-term bursts moreover, some systems do not support the ability to move operators dynamically. In this paper, we develop algorithms for selecting an operator placement plan that is resilient to changes in load. In other words, we assume that operators cannot move, therefore, we try to place them in such a way that the resulting system will be able to withstand the largest set of input rate combinations. We call this a resilient placement.This paper first formalizes the problem for operators that exhibit linear load characteristics (e.g., filter, aggregate), and introduces a resilient placement algorithm. We then show how we can extend our algorithm to take advantage of additional workload information (such as known minimum input stream rates). We further show how this approach can be extended to operators that exhibit non-linear load characteristics (e.g., join).

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries.

Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. We develop two efficient algorithms. The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.|Jian Pei,Bin Jiang,Xuemin Lin,Yidong Yuan","58097|GECCO|2007|Mining breast cancer data with XCS|In this paper, we describe the use of a modern learning classifier system to a data mining task.

Recently, with the increasing use of ontology in various applications, the quest has become more concrete and urgent. However, manipulating knowledge along with relational data in DBMSs is not a trivial undertaking. In this paper, we introduce a novel, unified framework for managing data and domain knowledge. We provide the user with a virtual view that unifies the data, the domain knowledge and the knowledge inferable from the data using the domain knowledge. Because the virtual view is in the relational format, users can query the data and the knowledge in a seamlessly integrated manner. To facilitate knowledge representation and inferencing within the database engine, our approach leverages XML support in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server & IBM DB  PureXML). We provide a query rewriting mechanism to bridge the difference between logical and physical data modeling, so that queries on the virtual view can be automatically transformed to components that execute on the hybrid relational-XML engine in a way that is transparent to the user.|Lipyeow Lim,Haixun Wang,Min Wang","80645|VLDB|2006|Efficient Discovery of XML Data Redundancies|As XML becomes widely used, dealing with redundancies in XML data has become an increasingly important issue. Redundantly stored information can lead not just to a higher data storage cost, but also to increased costs for data transfer and data manipulation. Furthermore, such data redundancies can lead to potential update anomalies, rendering the database inconsistent.One way to avoid data redundancies is to employ good schema design based on known functional dependencies. In fact, several recent studies have focused on defining the notion of XML Functional Dependencies (XML FDs) to capture XML data redundancies. We observe further that XML databases are often \"casually designed\" and XML FDs may not be determined in advance. Under such circumstances, discovering XML data redundancies (in terms of FDs) from the data itself becomes necessary and is an integral part of the schema refinement process.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first system, DiscoverXFD, for effcient discovery of XML data redundancies. It employs a novel XML data structure and introduces a new class of partition based algorithms. DiscoverXFD can not only be used for the previous definitions of XML functional dependencies, but also for a more comprehensive notion we develop in this paper, capable of detecting redundancies involving set elements while maintaining clear semantics. Experimental evaluations using real life and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system is practical and scales well with increasing data size.|Cong Yu,H. V. Jagadish","80672|VLDB|2006|Efficient Incremental Maintenance of Data Cubes|The data cube provides users with aggregated results that are group-bys for all possible combinations of dimension attributes. When the number of dimension attributes is n, the data cube computes n group-bys, each of which is called a cuboid. A data cube is often precomputed and stored as materialized views in data warehouses. The data cube needs to be updated when source relations change. The incremental maintenance of a data cube is to compute and propagate only changes of source relations rather than recompute the entire data cube from the source relations.To maintain a data cube incrementally, previous methods compute a delta cube which represents the change of the data cube. We call a cuboid in a delta cube a delta cuboid. For a data cube with n cuboids, a delta cube consists of n delta cuboids. Thus, as the number of dimension attributes increases, the cost of computing the delta cube increases significantly. In this paper, we propose an incremental maintenance method for data cubes that can maintain a data cube by using only (n n) delta cuboids. As a result, the cost of computing delta cuboids is substantially reduced. Through various experiments, we show the performance advantages of our method over the previous methods.|Ki Yong Lee,Myoung-Ho Kim","80728|VLDB|2007|Mining Approximate Top-K Subspace Anomalies in Multi-Dimensional Time-Series Data|Market analysis is a representative data analysis process with many applications. In such an analysis, critical numerical measures, such as profit and sales, fluctuate over time and form time-series data. Moreover, the time series data correspond to market segments, which are described by a set of attributes, such as age, gender, education, income level, and product-category, that form a multi-dimensional structure. To better understand market dynamics and predict future trends, it is crucial to study the dynamics of time-series in multi-dimensional market segments. This is a topic that has been largely ignored in time series and data cube research. In this study, we examine the issues of anomaly detection in multi-dimensional time-series data. We propose time-series data cube to capture the multi-dimensional space formed by the attribute structure. This facilitates the detection of anomalies based on expected values derived from higher level, \"more general\" time-series. Anomaly detection in a time-series data cube poses computational challenges, especially for high-dimensional, large data sets. To this end, we also propose an efficient search algorithm to iteratively select subspaces in the original high-dimensional space and detect anomalies within each one. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution.|Xiaolei Li,Jiawei Han","80852|VLDB|2007|Efficient Processing of Top-k Dominating Queries on Multi-Dimensional Data|The top-k dominating query returns k data objects which dominate the highest number of objects in a dataset.

In addition, it combines the advantages of top-k and skyline queries without sharing their disadvantages (i) the output size can be controlled, (ii) no ranking functions need to be specified by users, and (iii) the result is independent of the scales at different dimensions. Despite their importance, top-k dominating queries have not received adequate attention from the research community. In this paper, we design specialized algorithms that apply on indexed multi-dimensional data and fully exploit the characteristics of the problem.

However, much of the work on forgetting, and other related approaches such as independence, irrelevance and novelty, has been restricted to the classical logics. This paper describes a detailed theoretical investigation of the notion of forgetting in the context of logic programming. We first provide a semantic definition of forgetting under the answer sets for extended logic programs. We then discuss the desirable properties and some motivating examples. An important result of this study is an algorithm for computing the result of forgetting in a logic program. Furthermore, we present a modified version of the algorithm and show that the time complexity of the new algorithm is polynomial with respect to the size of the given logic program if the size of certain rules is fixed. We show how the proposed theory of forgetting can be used to characterize the logic program updates.|Kewen Wang,Abdul Sattar,Kaile Su","65822|AAAI|2006|Finding Maximally Satisfiable Terminologies for the Description Logic ALC|For ontologies represented as Description Logic Tboxes, optimised DL reasoners are able to detect logical errors, but there is comparatively limited support for resolving such problems.

Such a knowledge base is constituted by two components, called TBox and ABox. The former expresses general knowledge about the concepts and their relationships, whereas the latter describes the state of affairs regarding the instances of concepts. We investigate the case where the update affects only the instance level of the ontology, i.e., the ABox. Building on classical approaches on knowledge base update, our first contribution is to provide a general semantics for instance level update in Description Logics. We then focus on DL-Lite, a specific Description Logic where the basic reasoning tasks are computationally tractable. We show that DL-Lite is closed with respect to instance level update, in the sense that the result of an update is always expressible as a new DL-Lite ABox. Finally we provide an algorithm that computes the result of an update in DL-Lite, and we show that it runs in polynomial time with respect to the size of both the original knowledge base and the update formula.|Giuseppe De Giacomo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Antonella Poggi,Riccardo Rosati","66045|AAAI|2007|A Generalized Gelfond-Lifschitz Transformation for Logic Programs with Abstract Constraints|We present a generalized Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation in order to define stable models for a logic program with arbitrary abstract constraints on sets (c-atoms). The generalization is based on a formal semantics and a novel abstract representation of c-atoms, as opposed to the commonly used power set form representation. In many cases, the abstract representation of a c-atom results in a substantial reduction of size from its power set form representation. We show that any c-atom A  (Ad, Ac) in the body of a clause can be characterized using its satisfiable sets, so that given an interpretation I the c-atom can be handled simply by introducing a special atom A together with a new clause A  A, ..., An for each satisfiable set A, ..., An of A.

These approaches generalize the fixpoint-based and the level mapping based answer set semantics of normal logic programs to the case of logic programs with arbitrary types of c-atoms. The results are four different answer set definitions which are equivalent when applied to normal logic programs. The standard fixpoint-based semantics of logic programs is generalized in two directions, called answer set by reduct and answer set by complement. These definitions, which differ from each other in the treatment of negation-as-failure (naf) atoms, make use of an immediate consequence operator to perform answer set checking, whose definition relies on the notion of conditional satisfaction of c-atoms w.r.t. a pair of interpretations. The other two definitions, called strongly and weakly well-supported models, are generalizations of the notion of well-supported models of normal logic programs to the case of programs with c-atoms. As for the case of fixpoint-based semantics, the difference between these two definitions is rooted in the treatment of naf atoms. We prove that answer sets by reduct (resp. by complement) are equivalent to weakly (resp. strongly) well-supported models of a program, thus generalizing the theorem on the correspondence between stable models and well-supported models of a normal logic program to the class of programs with c-atoms. We show that the newly defined semantics coincide with previously introduced semantics for logic programs with monotone c-atoms, and they extend the original answer set semantics of normal logic programs. We also study some properties of answer sets of programs with c-atoms, and relate our definitions to several semantics for logic programs with aggregates presented in the literature.|Tran Cao Son,Enrico Pontelli,Phan Huy Tu"],["58133|GECCO|2007|MILCS a mutual information learning classifier system|This paper introduces a new variety of learning classifier system (LCS), called MILCS, which utilizes mutual information as fitness feedback.

This operator, unlike other recent LCS approaches of smart recombination, does not learn the structure of the domain, but it merges the rules of N parents (N  ) to generate a new offspring. This merge process uses an heuristic that selects the minimum subset of candidate rules that obtains maximum training accuracy. Moreover the operator also includes a rule pruning scheme to avoid the inclusion of over-specific rules, and to guarantee as much as possible the robust behaviour of the LCS. This operator takes advantage from the fact that each individual in a Pittsburgh LCS is a complete solution, and the system has a global view of the solution space that the proposed rule selection algorithm exploits.

Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies.

This repetition mirrors inherent geometric regularities in the physical world. For example, stimuli that excite adjacent locations on the retina map to neurons that are similarly adjacent in the visual cortex. That way, neural connectivity can exploit geometric locality in the outside world by employing local connections in the brain. If such regularities could be discovered by methods that evolve artificial neural networks (ANNs), then they could be similarly exploited to solve problems that would otherwise require optimizing too many dimensions to solve. This paper introduces such a method, called Hypercube-based Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT), which evolves a novel generative encoding called connective Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (connective CPPNs) to discover geometric regularities in the task domain. Connective CPPNs encode connectivity patterns as concepts that are independent of the number of inputs or outputs, allowing functional large-scale neural networks to be evolved. In this paper, this approach is tested in a simple visual task for which it effectively discovers the correct underlying regularity, allowing the solution to both generalize and scale without loss of function to an ANN of over eight million connections.|Jason Gauci,Kenneth O.

For example, during the time a signal travels from a peripheral sensor to the central nervous system, a moving object in the environment can cover a significant distance which can lead to critical errors in the effect of the corresponding motor output. This paper proposes that facilitating synapses which show a dynamic sensitivity to the changing input may play an important role in compensating for neural delays, through extrapolation. The idea was tested in a modified D pole-balancing problem which included sensory delays. Within this domain, we tested the behavior of recurrent neural networks with facilitatory neural dynamics trained via neuroevolution. Analysis of the performance and the evolved network parameters showed that, under various forms of delay, networks utilizing extrapolatory dynamics are at a significant competitive advantage compared to networks without such dynamics. In sum, facilitatory (or extrapolatory) dynamics can be used to compensate for delay at a single-neuron level, thus allowing a developing nervous system to stay in touch with the present environmental state.|Heejin Lim,Yoonsuck Choe"],["57864|GECCO|2006|A GA-ACO-local search hybrid algorithm for solving quadratic assignment problem|In recent decades, many meta-heuristics, including genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) and various local search (LS) procedures have been developed for solving a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.

An important class of dynamic problems is the class of tracking problems where an algorithm has to find an approximately optimal solution and insure an almost constant quality in spite of the changing problem. For the application of evolutionary algorithms to static optimization problems, the distribution of the optimization time and most often its expected value are most important. Adopting this perspective a simple tracking problem in the lattice is considered and the performance of a mutation-based evolutionary algorithm is evaluated. For the static case, asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds are proven. These results are applied to derive results on the tracking performance for different rates of change.|Thomas Jansen,Ulf Schellbach","57326|GECCO|2005|Probing for limits to building block mixing with a tunably-difficult problem for genetic programming|This paper describes a tunably-difficult problem for genetic programming (GP) that probes for limits to building block mixing and assembly.

The Quadratic Knapsack Problem extends the familiar Knapsack Problem by assigning values not only to individual objects but also to pairs of objects. In these problems, an object's value density is the sum of the values associated with it divided by its weight. Two greedy heuristics for the quadratic problem examine objects for inclusion in the knapsack in descending order of their value densities. Two genetic algorithms encode candidate selections of objects as binary strings and generate only strings whose selections of objects have total weight no more than the knapsack's capacity. One GA is naive its operators apply no information about the values associated with objects. The second extends the naive GA with greedy techniques from the non-evolutionary heuristics. Its operators examine objects for inclusion in the knapsack in orders determined by tournaments based on objects' value densities. All four algorithms are tested on twenty problem instances whose optimum knapsack values are known. The greedy heuristics do well, as does the naive GA, but the greedy GA exhibits the best performance. In repeated trials on the test instances, it identifies optimum solutions more than nine times out of every ten.|Bryant A.

Such parameters include categorical choices (e.g., neighborhood structure in local search or variablevalue ordering heuristics in tree search), as well as numerical parameters (e.g., noise or restart timing). In practice, tuning of these parameters is largely carried out manually by applying rules of thumb and crude heuristics, while more principled approaches are only rarely used. In this paper, we present a local search approach for algorithm configuration and prove its convergence to the globally optimal parameter configuration. Our approach is very versatile it can, e.g., be used for minimising run-time in decision problems or for maximising solution quality in optimisation problems. It further applies to arbitrary algorithms, including heuristic tree search and local search algorithms, with no limitation on the number of parameters. Experiments in four algorithm configuration scenarios demonstrate that our automatically determined parameter settings always outperform the algorithm defaults, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. Our approach also shows better performance and greater flexibility than the recent CALIBRA system.

While any search space can be observed at any scale according to the level of details, there is nothing inherent to the classical metaheuristics to naturally account for this multi-scaling. Nevertheless, the wider the search space the longer the time needed by any metaheuristic to discover and exploit the \"promising\" zones. Any possibility to compress this time is welcome. Abstracting the search space during the search is one such possibility. For instance, a common Ordering Genetic Algorithm (o-GA) is not well suited to efficiently resolve very large instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The mechanism presented here (reminiscent of Gestalt psychology) aims at abstracting the search space by substituting the variables of the problems with macro-versions of them. This substitution allows any given metaheuristic to tackle the problem at various scales or through different multi-resolution lenses. In the TSP problem to be treated here, the towns will simply be aggregated into regions and the metaheuristics will apply on this new one-level-up search space. The whole problem becomes now how to discover the most appropriate regions and to merge this discovery with the running of the o-GA at the new level.|Christophe Philemotte,Hugues Bersini","57584|GECCO|2005|MRI magnet design search space analysis EDAs and a real-world problem with significant dependencies|This paper introduces the design of superconductive magnet configurations in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems as a challenging real-world problem for Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems.

The main characteristic feature of the EMO approach is that no a priori information about the decision maker's preference is assumed. The EMO approach tries to find well-distributed trade-off solutions with a wide range of objective values as many as possible. A final solution is supposed to be chosen from the obtained trade-off solutions by the decision maker. On the other hand, the reference solution-based approach utilizes the information about the decision maker's preference in the form of a reference solution. We examine whether the EMO approach can find good trade-off solutions close to an arbitrarily given reference solution. Experimental results show that good solutions are not always obtained by the EMO approach. We also examine where the reference solution-based approach can find many trade-off solutions around the given reference solution. Experimental results show that many trade-off solutions can not be obtained even when an archive population of non-dominated solutions is stored in the reference solution-based approach.

Although promising results have already been obtained when combined with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), an important question remains what is the best way to integrate the use of gradient techniques in the evolutionary cycle of a MOEA. In this paper, we present an adaptive resource-allocation scheme that uses three gradient techniques in addition to the variation operator in a MOEA. During optimization, the effectivity of the gradient techniques is monitored and the available computational resources are redistributed to allow the (currently) most effective operator to spend the most resources. In addition, we indicate how the multi-objective search can be stimulated to also search $mboxemphalong $ the Pareto front, ultimately resulting in a better and wider spread of solutions. We perform tests on a few well-known benchmark problems as well as two novel benchmark problems with specific gradient properties. We compare the results of our adaptive resource-allocation scheme with the same MOEA without the use of gradient techniques and a scheme in which resource allocation is constant. The results show that our proposed adaptive resource-allocation scheme makes proper use of the gradient techniques only when required and thereby leads to results that are close to the best results that can be obtained by fine-tuning the resource allocation for a specific problem.|Peter A.

The aim of solving such problems is to obtain solutions that in terms of objectives and feasibility are as good as possible and at the same time are least sensitive to the parameter variations. Such solutions are said to be robust optimum solutions. In order to investigate the trade-off between the performance and robustness of optimum solutions, we present a new Robust Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (RMOGA) that optimizes two objectives a fitness value and a robustness index. The fitness value serves as a measure of performance of design solutions with respect to multiple objectives and feasibility of the original optimization problem. The robustness index, which is based on a non-gradient based parameter sensitivity estimation approach, is a measure that quantitatively evaluates the robustness of design solutions. RMOGA does not require a presumed probability distribution of uncontrollable parameters and also does not utilize the gradient information of these parameters. Three distance metrics are used to obtain the robustness index and robust solutions.
