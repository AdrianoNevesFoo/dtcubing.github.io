In many applications such as physiological data modeling and speaker identification, however, training examples are often labeled objects and each of the labeled objects consists of multiple unlabeled instances. When classifying a new object, its class is determined by the majority of its instance classes. As a consequence of this decision rule, one challenge to learning with labeled objects (or sessions) is to determine during training which subset of the instances inside an object should belong to the class of the object. We call this type of learning 'session-based learning' to distinguish it from the traditional supervised learning. In this paper, we introduce session-based learning problems, give a formal description of session-based learning in the context of related work, and propose an approach that is particularly designed for session-based learning. Empirical studies with UCI datasets and real-world data show that the proposed approach is effective for session-based learning.|Rong Jin,Huan Liu","16122|IJCAI|2005|Feature Generation for Text Categorization Using World Knowledge|We enhance machine learning algorithms for text categorization with generated features based on domain-specific and common-sense knowledge. This knowledge is represented using publicly available ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, such as the Open Directory these ontologies are further enriched by several orders of magnitude through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the documents alone.

We present a novel algorithm for finite domain constraint optimization that generalizes branch-and-bound search by reasoning about sets of assignments rather than individual assignments. Because in many practical cases, sets of assignments can be represented implicitly and compactly using symbolic techniques such as decision diagrams, the set-based algorithm can compute bounds faster than explicitly searching over individual assignments, while memory explosion can be avoided by limiting the size of the sets. Varying the size of the sets yields a family of algorithms that includes known search and inference algorithms as special cases.

Window split provides operators for parallel execution of query functions by reducing the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluate these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that window split is favorable when expensive queries are executed on limited resources, while window distribution is better otherwise.|Milena Ivanova,Tore Risch","80508|VLDB|2005|Efficiently Processing Queries on Interval-and-Value Tuples in Relational Databases|With the increasing occurrence of temporal and spatial data in present-day database applications, the interval data type is adopted by more and more database systems.

This knowledge is represented using publicly available ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, such as the Open Directory these ontologies are further enriched by several orders of magnitude through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing--synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the documents alone. Experimental results confirm improved performance, breaking through the plateau previously reached in the field.|Evgeniy Gabrilovich,Shaul Markovitch","16082|IJCAI|2005|Stacked Sequential Learning|We describe a new sequential learning scheme called \"stacked sequential learning\".

We evaluate the method on several \"sequential partitioning problems\", which are characterized by long runs of identical labels. We demonstrate that on these problems, sequential stacking consistently improves the performance of nonsequential base learners that sequential stacking often improves performance of learners (such as CRFs) that are designed specifically for sequential tasks and that a sequentially stacked maximum-entropy learner generally outperforms CRFs.|William W.

Ensembles allow us to achieve higher accuracy, which is often not achievable with single models.

Among different approaches to ensemble feature selection, genetic search was shown to perform best in many domains. In this paper, a new strategy GAS-SEFS, Genetic Algorithmbased Sequential Search for Ensemble Feature Selection, is introduced. Instead of one genetic process, it employs a series of processes, the goal of each of which is to build one base classifier. Experiments on  data sets are conducted, comparing the new strategy with a previously considered genetic strategy for different ensemble sizes and for five different ensemble integration methods.

LRA measures similarity in the semantic relations between two pairs of words. When two pairs have a high degree of relational similarity, they are analogous. For example, the pair catmeow is analogous to the pair dogbark. There is evidence from cognitive science that relational similarity is fundamental to many cognitive and linguistic tasks (e.g., analogical reasoning). In the Vector Space Model (VSM) approach to measuring relational similarity, the similarity between two pairs is calculated by the cosine of the angle between the vectors that represent the two pairs. The elements in the vectors are based on the frequencies of manually constructed patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three ways () patterns are derived automatically from the corpus, () Singular Value Decomposition is used to smooth the frequency data, and () synonyms are used to reformulate word pairs. This paper describes the LRA algorithm and experimentally compares LRA to VSM on two tasks, answering college-level multiple-choice word analogy questions and classifying semantic relations in noun-modifier expressions. LRA achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching human-level performance on the analogy questions and significantly exceeding VSM performance on both tasks.|Peter D.

We applied the complementary similarity measure (CSM) to determine a hierarchical structure of word meanings. The CSM is a similarity measure developed for recognizing degraded machine-printed text. There are CSMs for both binary and gray-scale images. The CSM for binary images has been applied to estimate one-to-many relations, such as superordinate-subordinate relations, and to extract word hierarchies. However, the CSM for gray-scale images has not been applied to natural language processing. Here, we apply the latter to extract word hierarchies from corpora. To do this, we used frequency information for co-occurring words, which is not considered when using the CSM for binary images. We compared our hierarchies with those obtained using the CSM for binary images, and evaluated them by measuring their degree of agreement with the EDR electronic dictionary.|Eiko Yamamoto,Kyoko Kanzaki,Hitoshi Isahara","80586|VLDB|2005|Querying Business Processes with BP-QL|We present in this paper BP-QL, a novel query language for querying business processes.

By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluate these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that window split is favorable when expensive queries are executed on limited resources, while window distribution is better otherwise.|Milena Ivanova,Tore Risch","80506|VLDB|2005|Bridging the Gap between OLAP and SQL|In the last ten years, database vendors have invested heavily in order to extend their products with new features for decision support.

The solution is not limited to simple selection predicate queries but handles arbitrary query types. While this work focuses mainly on read-only, compute-intensive (e.g. data-mining) queries, it also provides preliminary mechanisms for handling data updates (at additional costs). We introduce query execution proofs for each executed batch of queries the database service provider is required to provide a strong cryptographic proof that provides assurance that the queries were actually executed correctly over their entire target data set. We implement a proof of concept and present experimental results in a real-world data mining application, proving the deployment feasibility of our solution. We analyze the solution and show that its overheads are reasonable and are far outweighed by the added security benefits. For example an assurance level of over % can be achieved with less than % execution time overhead.|Radu Sion","80542|VLDB|2005|Database-Inspired Search|\"WQL A Query Language for the WWW\", published in , presented a language with several distinctive features.

Effective solutions have to be simultaneously spacetime efficient (at each remote monitor site), communication efficient (across the underlying communication network), and provide continuous, guaranteed-quality approximate query answers. In this paper, we propose novel algorithmic solutions for the problem of continuously tracking a broad class of complex aggregate queries in such a distributed-streams setting. Our tracking schemes maintain approximate query answers with provable error guarantees, while simultaneously optimizing the storage space and processing time at each remote site, and the communication cost across the network. They rely on tracking general-purpose randomized sketch summaries of local streams at remote sites along with concise prediction models of local site behavior in order to produce highly communication- and spacetime-efficient solutions. The result is a powerful approximate query tracking framework that readily incorporates several complex analysis queries (including distributed join and multi-join aggregates, and approximate wavelet representations), thus giving the first known low-overhead tracking solution for such queries in the distributed-streams model.|Graham Cormode,Minos N.

In the probabilistic setting, we cope with the tree annotation problem as a generalized probabilistic context-free parsing of an observation sequence where each observation comes with a probability distribution over terminals supplied by a probabilistic classifier associated with the content of documents. We determine the most probable tree annotation by maximizing the joint probability of selecting a terminal sequence for the observation sequence and the most probable parse for the selected terminal sequence.|Boris Chidlovskii,J√©r√¥me Fuselier","16139|IJCAI|2005|Learning Coordination Classifiers|We present a new approach to ensemble classification that requires learning only a single base classifier. The idea is to learn a classifier that simultaneously predicts pairs of test labels--as opposed to learning multiple predictors for single test labels-- then coordinating the assignment of individual labels by propagating beliefs on a graph over the data. We argue that the approach is statistically well motivated, even for independent identically distributed (iid) data. In fact, we present experimental results that show improvements in classification accuracy over single-example classifiers, across a range of iid data sets and over a set of base classifiers. Like boosting, the technique increases representational capacity while controlling variance through a principled form of classifier combination.|Yuhong Guo,Russell Greiner,Dale Schuurmans","80598|VLDB|2005|Statistical Learning Techniques for Costing XML Queries|Developing cost models for query optimization is significantly harder for XML queries than for traditional relational queries. The reason is that XML query operators are much more complex than relational operators such as table scans and joins. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called COMET, to modeling the cost of XML operators to our knowledge, COMET is the first method ever proposed for addressing the XML query costing problem. As in relational cost estimation, COMET exploits a set of system catalog statistics that summarizes the XML data the set of \"simple path\" statistics that we propose is new, and is well suited to the XML setting. Unlike the traditional approach, COMET uses a new statistical learning technique called \"transform regression\" instead of detailed analytical models to predict the overall cost. Besides rendering the cost estimation problem tractable for XML queries, COMET has the further advantage of enabling the query optimizer to be self-tuning, automatically adapting to changes over time in the query workload and in the system environment. We demonstrate COMET's feasibility by developing a cost model for the recently proposed XNAV navigational operator. Empirical studies with synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets show that COMET can quickly obtain accurate cost estimates for a variety of XML queries and data sets.|Ning Zhang 0002,Peter J.

So far much of the research has been focused on English due to the lack of semantically annotated resources in other languages. In this paper, we report first results on semantic role labeling using a pre-release version of the Chinese Proposition Bank. Since the Chinese Proposition Bank is superimposed on top of the Chinese Tree-bank, i.e., the semantic role labels are assigned to constituents in a treebank parse tree, we start by reporting results on experiments using the handcrafted parses in the treebank. This will give us a measure of the extent to which the semantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation in the treebank. We will then report experiments using a fully automatic Chinese parser that integrates word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing. This will gauge how successful semantic role labeling can be done for Chinese in realistic situations. We show that our results using hand-crafted parses are slightly higher than the results reported for the state-of-the-art semantic role labeling systems for English using the Penn English Proposition Bank data, even though the Chinese Proposition Bank is smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our system is much lower than the English state-of-the-art. This reveals an interesting cross-linguistic difference between the two languages, which we attempt to explain.

Nevertheless, SRL approaches currently are constrained to use the existing database schema. For many database applications, users find it profitable to define alternative \"views\" of the database, in effect defining new fields or tables. Such new fields or tables can also be highly useful in learning. We provide SRL with the capability of learning new views.|Jesse Davis,Elizabeth S.

In many applications such as physiological data modeling and speaker identification, however, training examples are often labeled objects and each of the labeled objects consists of multiple unlabeled instances. When classifying a new object, its class is determined by the majority of its instance classes. As a consequence of this decision rule, one challenge to learning with labeled objects (or sessions) is to determine during training which subset of the instances inside an object should belong to the class of the object. We call this type of learning 'session-based learning' to distinguish it from the traditional supervised learning. In this paper, we introduce session-based learning problems, give a formal description of session-based learning in the context of related work, and propose an approach that is particularly designed for session-based learning. Empirical studies with UCI datasets and real-world data show that the proposed approach is effective for session-based learning.|Rong Jin,Huan Liu","16187|IJCAI|2005|Transfer in Learning by Doing|We develop two related themes, learning procedures and knowledge transfer.

Meanwhile, virtually all these problems require classifiers that minimize a nonuniform loss function associated with the classification decisions (rather than the accuracy or number of errors). For example, to train pattern classification models for a network intrusion detection task, experts need to analyze network events and assign them labels. This can be a very costly procedure if the instances to be labeled are selected at random. In the meantime, the loss associated with mislabeling an intrusion is much higher than the loss associated with the opposite error (i.e., labeling a legal event as being an intrusion). As a result, to address these types of tasks, practitioners need tools that minimize the total cost computed as a sum of the cost of labeling and the loss associated with the decisions. This paper describes an approach for addressing this problem.|Dragos D.

The reason is that XML query operators are much more complex than relational operators such as table scans and joins. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called COMET, to modeling the cost of XML operators to our knowledge, COMET is the first method ever proposed for addressing the XML query costing problem. As in relational cost estimation, COMET exploits a set of system catalog statistics that summarizes the XML data the set of \"simple path\" statistics that we propose is new, and is well suited to the XML setting. Unlike the traditional approach, COMET uses a new statistical learning technique called \"transform regression\" instead of detailed analytical models to predict the overall cost. Besides rendering the cost estimation problem tractable for XML queries, COMET has the further advantage of enabling the query optimizer to be self-tuning, automatically adapting to changes over time in the query workload and in the system environment. We demonstrate COMET's feasibility by developing a cost model for the recently proposed XNAV navigational operator. Empirical studies with synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets show that COMET can quickly obtain accurate cost estimates for a variety of XML queries and data sets.|Ning Zhang 0002,Peter J.

The difficulties in applying the existing top-k algorithms to XML data lie in ) the need to consider scores for XML elements while aggregating them at the document level, ) the combination of vague content conditions with XML path conditions, ) the need to relax query conditions if too few results satisfy all conditions, and ) the selectivity estimation for both content and structure conditions and their impact on evaluation strategies. TopX addresses these issues by precomputing score and path information in an appropriately designed index structure, by largely avoiding or postponing the evaluation of expensive path conditions so as to preserve the sequential access pattern on index lists, and by selectively scheduling random accesses when they are cost-beneficial. In addition, TopX can compute approximate top-k results using probabilistic score estimators, thus speeding up queries with a small and controllable loss in retrieval precision.|Martin Theobald,Ralf Schenkel,Gerhard Weikum","16276|IJCAI|2005|Development of new techniques to improve Web search|Web search engines are a great help for accessing web sites but they present several problems regarding semantic ambiguity.

In this paper, information preservation for XML is formally studied, and the results of this study guide the definition of a novel notion of schema embedding between two XML DTD schemas represented as graphs. Schema embedding generalizes the conventional notion of graph similarity by allowing an edge in a source DTD schema to be mapped to a path in the target DTD. Instance-level embeddings can be defined from the schema embedding in a straightforward manner, such that conformance to a target schema and information preservation are guaranteed. We show that it is NP-complete to find an embedding between two DTD schemas. We also provide efficient heuristic algorithms to find candidate embeddings, along with experimental results to evaluate and compare the algorithms.

So far much of the research has been focused on English due to the lack of semantically annotated resources in other languages. In this paper, we report first results on semantic role labeling using a pre-release version of the Chinese Proposition Bank. Since the Chinese Proposition Bank is superimposed on top of the Chinese Tree-bank, i.e., the semantic role labels are assigned to constituents in a treebank parse tree, we start by reporting results on experiments using the handcrafted parses in the treebank. This will give us a measure of the extent to which the semantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation in the treebank. We will then report experiments using a fully automatic Chinese parser that integrates word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing. This will gauge how successful semantic role labeling can be done for Chinese in realistic situations. We show that our results using hand-crafted parses are slightly higher than the results reported for the state-of-the-art semantic role labeling systems for English using the Penn English Proposition Bank data, even though the Chinese Proposition Bank is smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our system is much lower than the English state-of-the-art. This reveals an interesting cross-linguistic difference between the two languages, which we attempt to explain.

It has been shown that the detection and exploitation of symmetric structure in planning problems can dramatically reduce the size of the search space and the time taken to find a solution. We present the idea of using an abstraction of the problem domain to reveal symmetric structure and guide the navigation of the search space. We show that this is effective even in domains in which there is little accessible symmetric structure available for pruning. Proactive exploitation represents a flexible and powerful alternative to the symmetry-breaking strategies exploited in earlier work in planning and CSPs. The notion of almost symmetry is defined and results are presented showing that proactive exploitation of almost symmetry can improve the performance of a heuristic forward search planner.|Maria Fox,Derek Long,Julie Porteous"],["16129|IJCAI|2005|A Probabilistic Lexical Approach to Textual Entailment|The textual entailment problem is to determine if a given text entails a given hypothesis.

We express efficiency and envy-freeness in a logical setting, which reveals unexpected connections to nonmonotonic reasoning. Then we identify the complexity of determining whether there exists an efficient and envy-free allocation, for several notions of efficiency, when preferences are represented in a succinct way (as well as restrictions of this problem).

Previous techniques have been inadequate, because they have focused mainly on the tag-labeled paths (tree structure) of the XML data. For most real XML data, the number of distinct string values at the leaf nodes is orders of magnitude larger than the set of distinct rooted tag paths. Hence, the real challenge lies in accurate selectivity estimation of the string predicates on the leaf values reachable via a given path.In this paper, we present CXHist, a novel workload-aware histogram technique that provides accurate selectivity estimation on a broad class of XML string-based queries. CXHist builds a histogram in an on-line manner by grouping queries into buckets using their true selectivity obtained from query feedback. The set of queries associated with each bucket is summarized into feature distributions. These feature distributions mimic a Bayesian classifier that is used to route a query to its associated bucket during selectivity estimation. We show how CXHist can be used for two general types of path, string queries exact match queries and substring match queries. Experiments using a prototype show that CXHist provides accurate selectivity estimation for both exact match queries and substring match queries.|Lipyeow Lim,Min Wang,Jeffrey Scott Vitter","16197|IJCAI|2005|From knowledge-based programs to graded belief-based programs part II off-line reasoning|Belief-based programs generalize knowledgebased programs Fagin et al.,  by allowing for incorrect beliefs, unreliable observations, and branching conditions that refer to implicit graded beliefs, such as in \"while my belief about the direction to the railway station is not strong enough do ask someone\".

In general, it is intractable in dynamic domains that include many objects and relationships. Still, potential applications for such domains (e.g., semantic web, autonomous agents, and partial-knowledge games) encourage research beyond immediate intractability results. In this paper we present polynomial-time algorithms for filtering belief states that are encoded as First-Order Logic (FOL) formulae. We sidestep previous discouraging results, and show that our algorithms are exact in many cases of interest. These algorithms accept belief states in full FOL, which allows natural representation with explicit references to unidentified objects, and partially known relationships. Our algorithms keep the encoding compact for important classes of actions, such as STRIPS actions. These results apply to most expressive modeling languages, such as partial databases and belief revision in FOL.|Afsaneh Shirazi,Eyal Amir"]]}}
