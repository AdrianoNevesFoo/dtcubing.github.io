In such a problem, the need of coping with incomplete information is the distinguishing feature with respect to querying databases. Due to this feature, we have to deal with two conflicting needs on the one hand, we would like to query the knowledge base with sophisticated mechanisms provided by full first-order logic (FOL) on the other hand, the presence of incomplete information makes query answering a much more difficult task than in databases. In this paper we advocate the use of a nonmonotonic epistemic FOL query language as a means for expressing sophisticated queries over Description Logic knowledge bases. We show that through a controlled use of the epistemic operator, resulting in the language called EQL-Lite, we are able to formulate full FOL queries over Description Logic knowledge bases, while keeping computational complexity of query answering under control. In particular, we show that EQL-Lite queries over DL-Lite knowledge bases are FOL reducible (i.e., compilable into SQL) and hence can be answered in LOGSPACE through standard database technologies.|Diego Calvanese,Giuseppe De Giacomo,Domenico Lembo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Riccardo Rosati","16662|IJCAI|2007|Contextual Default Reasoning|In this paper we introduce a multi-context variant of Reiter's default logic.

Given a positive definite kernel function, it is well known that the input data are implicitly mapped to a feature space with usually very high dimensionality. The goal of KFE is to find a low dimensional subspace of this feature space, which retains most of the information needed for classification or data analysis. In this paper, we propose a subspace kernel based on which the feature extraction problem is transformed to a kernel parameter learning problem. The key observation is that when projecting data into a low dimensional subspace of the feature space, the parameters that are used for describing this subspace can be regarded as the parameters of the kernel function between the projected data. Therefore current kernel parameter learning methods can be adapted to optimize this parameterized kernel function. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.|Mingrui Wu,Jason D. R.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately.

The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

It has been shown empirically that large tractable subsets of these calculi not only provide efficient algorithms for reasoning problems that can be expressed with relations contained in the tractable subsets, but also surprisingly efficient solutions to the general, NP-hard reasoning problems of the full calculi. An important step in this direction was the refinement algorithm which provides a heuristic for proving tractability of given subsets of relations. In this paper we extend the refinement algorithm and present a procedure which identifies large tractable subsets of spatial and temporal calculi automatically without any manual intervention and without the need for additional NP-hardness proofs. While we can only guarantee tractability of the resulting sets, our experiments show that for RCC and the Interval Algebra, our procedure automatically identifies all maximal tractable subsets.

We show that when the topological network is over one of the three maximal tractable subclasses of RCC, the problem can be reduced into satisfiability problems in the RCC algebra and the rectangle algebra (RA). Therefore, reasoning techniques developed for RCC and RA can be used to solve the satisfiability problem of a joint network.|Sanjiang Li","16677|IJCAI|2007|Consistency Checking of Basic Cardinal Constraints over Connected Regions|In this paper we study a recent formal model for qualitative spatial reasoning with cardinal direction relations.

First, the paper develops First Order Decision Diagrams (FODD), a new compact representation for functions over relational structures, together with a set of operators to combine FODDs, and novel reduction techniques to keep the representation small. Second, the paper shows how FODDs can be used to develop solutions for RMDPs, where reasoning is performed at the abstract level and the resulting optimal policy is independent of domain size (number of objects) or instantiation. In particular, a variant of the value iteration algorithm is developed by using special operations over FODDs, and the algorithm is shown to converge to the optimal policy.|Chenggang Wang,Saket Joshi,Roni Khardon"],["16731|IJCAI|2007|Online Learning and Exploiting Relational Models in Reinforcement Learning|In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using rich representations such as relational languages for reinforcement learning.

The present paper presents SAYU-VISTA, an algorithm which advances beyond the initial view learning approach in three ways. First, it learns views that introduce new relational tables, rather than merely new fields for an existing table of the database. Second, new tables or new fields are not limited to being approximations to some target concept instead, the new approach performs a type of predicate invention. The new approach avoids the classical problem with predicate invention, of learning many useless predicates, by keeping only new fields or tables (i.e., new predicates) that immediately improve the performance of the statistical model. Third, retained fields or tables can then be used in the definitions of further new fields or tables.

However, the development of SANNs has traditionally focused on data domains that are assumed to be modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of data governed by other statistical models, such as the Poisson distribution, has received less attention from the data mining community. Based on special considerations of the statistical nature of data following a Poisson distribution, this paper introduces a SANN, Poisson-based Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (PSOTA), which implements novel similarity matching criteria and neuron weight adaptation schemes. It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood. This study indicate that, in comparison to the traditional Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA), PSOTA offers significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization in data modeled by the Poisson distribution, such as serial analysis of gene expression data.|Haiying Wang,Huiru Zheng,Francisco Azuaje","16435|IJCAI|2007|Predicting and Preventing Coordination Problems in Cooperative Q-learning Systems|We present a conceptual framework for creating Q-learning-based algorithms that converge to optimal equilibria in cooperative multiagent settings.

Whereas social laws need to be enforced in a top-down manner, norms evolve in a bottom-up manner and are typically more self-enforcing. While effective norms can significantly enhance performance of individual agents and agent societies, there has been little work in multiagent systems on the formation of social norms. We propose a model that supports the emergence of social norms via learning from interaction experiences. In our model, individual agents repeatedly interact with other agents in the society over instances of a given scenario. Each interaction is framed as a stage game. An agent learns its policy to play the game over repeated interactions with multiple agents. We term this mode of learning social learning, which is distinct from an agent learning from repeated interactions against the same player. We are particularly interested in situations where multiple action combinations yield the same optimal payoff. The key research question is to find out if the entire population learns to converge to a consistent norm. In addition to studying such emergence of social norms among homogeneous learners via social learning, we study the effects of heterogeneous learners, population size, multiple social groups, etc.|Sandip Sen,St√©phane Airiau","16634|IJCAI|2007|Transfer Learning in Real-Time Strategy Games Using Hybrid CBRRL|The goal of transfer learning is to use the knowledge acquired in a set of source tasks to improve performance in a related but previously unseen target task.

However, it is often the case that a similarity function is unknown or chosen by hand. This paper introduces a formulation that given relative similarity comparisons among triples of points of the form object i is more like object j than object k, it constructs a kernel function that preserves the given relationships. Our approach is based on learning a kernel that is a combination of functions taken from a set of base functions (these could be kernels as well). The formulation is based on defining an optimization problem that can be solved using linear programming instead of a semidefinite program usually required for kernel learning. We show how to construct a convex problem from the given set of similarity comparisons and then arrive to a linear programming formulation by employing a subset of the positive definite matrices. We extend this formulation to consider representationevaluation efficiency based on formulating a novel form of feature selection using kernels (that is not much more expensive to solve). Using publicly available data, we experimentally demonstrate how the formulation introduced in this paper shows excellent performance in practice by comparing it with a baseline method and a related state-of-the art approach, in addition of being much more efficient computationally.|Glenn Fung,R√≥mer Rosales,R.

Their long-term goal is to produce practical tools to solve combinatorial search problems, especially those in NP. In this framework, a problem is encoded in a logic, an instance of the problem is represented by a finite structure, and a solver generates solutions to the problem. This approach relies on propositionalisation of high-level specifications, and on the efficiency of modern SAT solvers.

Since the MX framework is based on classical logic, we are able to take advantage of known results for the so-called guarded fragments.

Machine learning (ML) provides several techniques for automatically acquiring those heuristics. Usually, a planner solves a problem, and a ML technique generates knowledge from the search episode in terms of complete plans (macro-operators or cases), or heuristics (also named control knowledge in planning). In this paper, we present a novel way of generating planning heuristics we learn heuristics in one planner and transfer them to another planner. This approach is based on the fact that different planners employ different search bias. We want to extract knowledge from the search performed by one planner and use the learned knowledge on another planner that uses a different search bias.

We draw on a recent framework for \"structured output classification\" (e.g. syntactic parsing) known as learning as search optimization (LaSO). The LaSO approach uses discriminative learning to optimize heuristic functions for search-based computation of structured outputs and has shown promising results in a number of domains. However, the search problems that arise in AI planning tend to be qualitatively very different from those considered in structured classification, which raises a number of potential difficulties in directly applying LaSO to planning. In this paper, we discuss these issues and describe a LaSO-based approach for discriminative learning of beam-search heuristics in AI planning domains. We give convergence results for this approach and present experiments in several benchmark domains. The results show that the discriminatively trained heuristic can outperform the one used by the planner FF and another recent non-discriminative learning approach.|Yuehua Xu,Alan Fern,Sung Wook Yoon","16733|IJCAI|2007|Planning with Goal Utility Dependencies|Work in partial satisfaction planning (PSP) has hitherto assumed that goals are independent thus implying that they have additive utility values. In many real-world problems, we cannot make this assumption. In this paper, we motivate the need for handling various types of goal utility dependence in PSP. We provide a framework for representing them using the General Additive Independence model and investigate two different approaches to handle this problem () compiling PSP with utility dependencies to Integer Programming () extending forward heuristic search planning to handle PSP goal dependencies. To guide the forward planning search, we introduce a novel heuristic framework that combines costpropagation and Integer Programming to select beneficial goals to find an informative heuristic estimate. The two implemented planners, iPUD and SPUDS, using the approaches discussed above, are compared empirically on several benchmark domains. While iPUD is more readily amendable to handle goal utility dependencies and can provide bounded optimality guarantees, SPUDS scales much better.|Minh Binh Do,J.

First, the nearest neighbors of a document belong to different classes in many cases since any pair of documents shares lots of \"general\" words. Second, the sparsity of class-specific \"core\" words leads to grouping documents with the same class labels into different clusters. Both problems can be resolved by suitable smoothing of document model and using Kullback-Leibler divergence of two smoothed models as pairwise document distances. Inspired by the recent work in information retrieval, we propose a novel context-sensitive semantic smoothing method that can automatically identifies multiword phrases in a document and then statistically map phrases to individual document terms.

However, many other criteria for clustering documents can be considered for example, documents' genre or the author's mood. We propose an interactive scheme for clustering document collections, based on any criterion of the user's preference. The user holds an active position in the clustering process first, she chooses the types of features suitable to the underlying task, leading to a task-specific document representation. She can then provide examples of features-- if such examples are emerging, e.g., when clustering by the author's sentiment, words like 'perfect', 'mediocre', 'awful' are intuitively good features. The algorithm proceeds iteratively, and the user can fix errors made by the clustering system at the end of each iteration. Such an interactive clustering method demonstrates excellent results on clustering by sentiment, substantially outperforming an SVM trained on a large amount of labeled data. Even if features are not provided because they are not intuitively obvious to the user--e.g., what would be good features for clustering by genre using part-of-speech trigrams--our multi-modal clustering method performs significantly better than k-means and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).|Ron Bekkerman,Hema Raghavan,James Allan,Koji Eguchi","16787|IJCAI|2007|A Faithful Integration of Description Logics with Logic Programming|Integrating description logics (DL) and logic programming (LP) would produce a very powerful and useful formalism.

Most supervised methods consider the summarization task as a two-class classification problem and classify each sentence individually without leveraging the relationship among sentences. The unsupervised methods use heuristic rules to select the most informative sentences into a summary directly, which are hard to generalize.

What is more, the proposed framework can take the outcomes of previous methods as features and seamlessly integrate them.

Given a positive definite kernel function, it is well known that the input data are implicitly mapped to a feature space with usually very high dimensionality. The goal of KFE is to find a low dimensional subspace of this feature space, which retains most of the information needed for classification or data analysis. In this paper, we propose a subspace kernel based on which the feature extraction problem is transformed to a kernel parameter learning problem. The key observation is that when projecting data into a low dimensional subspace of the feature space, the parameters that are used for describing this subspace can be regarded as the parameters of the kernel function between the projected data. Therefore current kernel parameter learning methods can be adapted to optimize this parameterized kernel function.

The agents will accept (partially or in full) or reject them based on their own social strategies and social positions. The diffusion of social strategies proceeds in a series of steps and the final result depends on the interplay between the forces driving diffusion and the counteracting forces.|Yichuan Jiang,Toru Ishida","16799|IJCAI|2007|Control of Agent Swarms Using Generalized Centroidal Cyclic Pursuit Laws|One of the major tasks in swarm intelligence is to design decentralized but homogenoeus strategies to enable controlling the behaviour of swarms of agents. It has been shown in the literature that the point of convergence and motion of a swarm of autonomous mobile agents can be controlled by using cyclic pursuit laws. In cyclic pursuit, there exists a predefined cyclic connection between agents and each agent pursues the next agent in the cycle. In this paper we generalize this idea to a case where an agent pursues a point which is the weighted average of the positions of the remaining agents. This point correspond to a particular pursuit sequence. Using this concept of centroidal cyclic pursuit, the behavior of the agents is analyzed such that, by suitably selecting the agents' gain, the rendezvous point of the agents can be controlled, directed linear motion of the agents can be achieved, and the trajectories of the agents can be changed by switching between the pursuit sequences keeping some of the behaviors of the agents invariant.

In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal. Our experimental results show that TVI outperforms VI, LAO, LRTDP and HDP on our benchmark MDPs.|Peng Dai,Judy Goldsmith","16621|IJCAI|2007|Solving POMDPs Using Quadratically Constrained Linear Programs|Developing scalable algorithms for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is an important challenge. One approach that effectively addresses the intractable memory requirements of POMDP algorithms is based on representing POMDP policies as finite-state controllers. In this paper, we illustrate some fundamental disadvantages of existing techniques that use controllers. We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques. The results open up promising research directions for solving large POMDPs using nonlinear programming methods.|Christopher Amato,Daniel S.

The paper studies efficient reasoning mechanisms for Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDP) where world states have an internal relational structure that can be naturally described in terms of objects and relations among them. Two contributions are presented. First, the paper develops First Order Decision Diagrams (FODD), a new compact representation for functions over relational structures, together with a set of operators to combine FODDs, and novel reduction techniques to keep the representation small. Second, the paper shows how FODDs can be used to develop solutions for RMDPs, where reasoning is performed at the abstract level and the resulting optimal policy is independent of domain size (number of objects) or instantiation. In particular, a variant of the value iteration algorithm is developed by using special operations over FODDs, and the algorithm is shown to converge to the optimal policy.|Chenggang Wang,Saket Joshi,Roni Khardon","16384|IJCAI|2007|Efficiently Exploiting Symmetries in Real Time Dynamic Programming|Current approaches to solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are sensitive to the size of the MDP. When applied to real world problems though, MDPs exhibit considerable implicit redundancy, especially in the form of symmetries. Existing model minimization methods do not exploit this redundancy due to symmetries well. In this work, given such symmetries, we present a time-efficient algorithm to construct a functionally equivalent reduced model of the MDP. Further, we present a Real Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP) algorithm which obviates an explicit construction of the reduced model by integrating the given symmetries into it. The RTDP algorithm solves the reduced model, while working with parameters of the original model and the given symmetries. As RTDP uses its experience to determine which states to backup, it focuses on parts of the reduced state set that are most relevant. This results in significantly faster learning and a reduced overall execution time. The algorithms proposed are particularly effective in the case of structured automorphisms even when the reduced model does not have fewer features. We demonstrate the results empirically on several domains.|Shravan Matthur Narayanamurthy,Balaraman Ravindran"],["16686|IJCAI|2007|Hierarchical Multi-channel Hidden Semi Markov Models|Many interesting human actions involve multiple interacting agents and also have typical durations.

In order to model these we introduce a new family of hidden Markov models (HMMs) that provide compositional state representations in both space and time and also a recursive hierarchical structure for inference at higher levels of abstraction. In particular, we focus on two possible -layer structures - the Hierarchical-Semi Parallel Hidden Markov Model (HSPaHMM) and the Hierarchical Parallel Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HPaHSMM). The lower layer of HSPaHMM consists of multiple HMMs for each agent while the top layer consists of a single HSMM. HPaHSMM on the other hand has multiple HSMMs at the lower layer and a Markov chain at the top layer.

In this paper, we present and evaluate a decision-theoretic framework that captures the general notion of assistance. The objective is to observe a goal-directed agent and to select assistive actions in order to minimize the overall cost. We model the problem as an assistant POMDP where the hidden state corresponds to the agent's unobserved goals. This formulation allows us to exploit domain models for both estimating the agent's goals and selecting assistive action. In addition, the formulation naturally handles uncertainty, varying action costs, and customization to specific agents via learning. We argue that in many domains myopic heuristics will be adequate for selecting actions in the assistant POMDP and present two such heuristics. We evaluate our approach in two domains where human subjects perform tasks in game-like computer environments.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence suggest that autonomous vehicle navigation may soon be a reality. In previous work, we have demonstrated that a reservation-based approach can efficiently and safely govern interactions of multiple autonomous vehicles at intersections. Such an approach alleviates many traditional problems associated with intersections, in terms of both safety and efficiency. However, the system relies on all vehicles being equipped with the requisite technology-a restriction that would make implementing such a system in the real world extremely difficult. In this paper, we extend this system to allow for incremental deployability. The modified system is able to accommodate traditional human-operated vehicles using existing infrastructure. Furthermore, we show that as the number of autonomous vehicles on the road increases, traffic delays decrease monotonically toward the levels exhibited in our previous work. Finally, we develop a method for switching between various human-usable configurations while the system is running, in order to facilitate an even smoother transition.

The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data.

The backtrack algorithms that maintain some local consistency during search have become the de facto standard to solve CSPs. Maintaining higher levels of consistency, generally, reduces the search effort. However, due to ineffective constraint propagation, it often penalises the search algorithm in terms of time. If we can reduce ineffective constraint propagation, then the effectiveness of a search algorithm can be enhanced significantly. In order to do so, we use a probabilistic approach to resolve when to propagate and when not to. The idea is to perform only the useful consistency checking by not seeking a support when there is a high probability that a support exists. The idea of probabilistic support inference is general and can be applied to any kind of local consistency algorithm. However, we shall study its impact with respect to arc consistency and singleton arc consistency (SAC). Experimental results demonstrate that enforcing probabilistic SAC almost always enforces SAC, but it requires significantly less time than SAC. Likewise, maintaining probabilistic arc consistency and maintaining probabilistic SAC require significantly less time than maintaining arc consistency and maintaining SAC.|Deepak Mehta,Marc R.

In fact, the aim of the paper is precisely to face these open research issues. First, CCSPs are formally characterized in terms of a suitable fragment of first-order logic. Second, the complexity of some basic reasoning tasks for CCSPs is studied, by establishing completeness results for the first and the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.

The two implemented planners, iPUD and SPUDS, using the approaches discussed above, are compared empirically on several benchmark domains. While iPUD is more readily amendable to handle goal utility dependencies and can provide bounded optimality guarantees, SPUDS scales much better.|Minh Binh Do,J.

This algorithm shows great performance improvements over hierarchical approaches using standard MDP solvers such as Value Iteration, as well as with respect to AO applied to a flat representation of the problem.

We then describe how two representative state-of-the-art domain independent planning approaches - one based on compilation to CSP, and the other based on heuristic local search - can be adapted to produce diverse plans.

Hansen","16547|IJCAI|2007|Transferring Learned Control-Knowledge between Planners|As any other problem solving task that employs search, AI Planning needs heuristics to efficiently guide the problem-space exploration. Machine learning (ML) provides several techniques for automatically acquiring those heuristics. Usually, a planner solves a problem, and a ML technique generates knowledge from the search episode in terms of complete plans (macro-operators or cases), or heuristics (also named control knowledge in planning). In this paper, we present a novel way of generating planning heuristics we learn heuristics in one planner and transfer them to another planner. This approach is based on the fact that different planners employ different search bias. We want to extract knowledge from the search performed by one planner and use the learned knowledge on another planner that uses a different search bias. The goal is to improve the efficiency of the second planner by capturing regularities of the domain that it would not capture by itself due to its bias. We employ a deductive learning method (EBL) that is able to automatically acquire control knowledge by generating bounded explanations of the problem-solving episodes in a Graphplan-based planner. Then, we transform the learned knowledge so that it can be used by a bidirectional planner.|Susana Fern√°ndez,Ricardo Aler,Daniel Borrajo","16437|IJCAI|2007|GUNSAT A Greedy Local Search Algorithm for Unsatisfiability|Local search algorithms for satisfiability testing are still the best methods for a large number of problems, despite tremendous progresses observed on complete search algorithms over the last few years.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16661|IJCAI|2007|An Experts Algorithm for Transfer Learning|A long-lived agent continually faces new tasks in its environment.

Scarcely do these systems take word sense transitions between senses of linearly consecutive words or syntactically dependent words into consideration. Word sense transitions are very important. They embody the fluency of semantic expression and avoid sparse data problem effectively. In this paper, How Net knowledge base is used to decompose every word sense into several sememes. Then one transition between two words' senses becomes multiple transitions between sememes. Sememe transitions are much easier to be captured than word sense transitions due to much less sememes. When sememes are labeled, WSD is done. In this paper, multi-layered conditional random fields (MLCRF) is proposed to model sememe transitions. The experiments show that MLCRF performs better than a base-line system and a maximum entropy model.

For ambiguous queries, a traditional approach is to organize search results into groups (clusters), one for each meaning of the query. These groups are usually constructed according to the topical similarity of the retrieved documents, but it is possible for documents to be totally dissimilar and still correspond to the same meaning of the query. To overcome this problem, we exploit the thematic locality of the Web--relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. We estimate the level of relevance between each pair of retrieved pages by the length of a path between them. The path is constructed using multi-agent beam search each agent starts with one Web page and attempts to meet as many other agents as possible with some bounded resources. We test the system on two types of queries ambiguous English words and people names. The Web appears to be tightly connected about % of the agents meet with each other after only three iterations of exhaustive breadth-first search. However, when heuristics are applied, the search becomes more focused and the obtained results are substantially more accurate.

The success of such search typically depends on heuristic distance-to-the-goal estimates derived from the plangraph. Such estimates are effective in guiding search for many domains, but there remain many other domains where current heuristics are inadequate to guide forward search effectively. In some of these domains, it is possible to learn reactive policies from example plans that solve many problems. However, due to the inductive nature of these learning techniques, the policies are often faulty, and fail to achieve high success rates.

In particular, during each search node expansion, we add not only its neighbors, but all the nodes along the trajectory followed by the policy from the node until some horizon.

In our approach, we presume that each motor primitive takes responsibility for controlling a small sub-block of motion, containing coherent muscle activation outputs. A central timing controller cues these subroutines of movement, creating complete movement strategies that are built up by overlaying primitives, thus creating synergies of muscle activation. This partitioning allows the movement to be defined by a sparse code representing the timing of primitive activations. This paper shows that it is possible to use a factorial hidden Markov model to infer primitives in handwriting data. The variation in the handwriting data can to a large extent be explained by timing variation in the triggering of the primitives. Once an appropriate set of primitives has been inferred, the characters can be represented as a set of timings of primitive activations, along with variances, giving a very compact representation of the character. The model is naturally partitioned into a low level primitive output stage, and a top-down primitive timing stage. This partitioning gives us an insight into behaviours such as scribbling, and what is learnt in order to write a new character.|Ben H. Williams,Marc Toussaint,Amos J.

In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, LAO, LRTDP and HDP are state-of-theart ones. All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space. We introduce an algorithm named Topological Value Iteration (TVI) that can circumvent the problem of unnecessary backups by detecting the structure of MDPs and backing up states based on topological sequences. We prove that the backup sequence TVI applies is optimal. Our experimental results show that TVI outperforms VI, LAO, LRTDP and HDP on our benchmark MDPs.|Peng Dai,Judy Goldsmith","16512|IJCAI|2007|Collaborative Inductive Logic Programming for Path Planning|In distributed systems, learning does not necessarily involve the participation of agents directly in the inductive process itself. Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a new approach for learning in distributed systems that tightly integrates processes of induction between agents, based on inductive logic programming techniques. The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

These planning problems can be modeled with continuous state Markov decision processes (MDPs) but existing solution methods are either inefficient or provide no guarantee on the quality of the resulting policy. We therefore present CPH, a novel solution method that solves the planning problems by first approximating with any desired accuracy the probability distributions over the resource consumptions with phasetype distributions, which use exponential distributions as building blocks. It then uses value iteration to solve the resulting MDPs by exploiting properties of exponential distributions to calculate the necessary convolutions accurately and efficiently while providing strong guarantees on the quality of the resulting policy. Our experimental feasibility study in a Mars rover domain demonstrates a substantial speedup over Lazy Approximation, which is currently the leading algorithm for solving continuous state MDPs with quality guarantees.|Janusz Marecki,Sven Koenig,Milind Tambe","16759|IJCAI|2007|Using Linear Programming for Bayesian Exploration in Markov Decision Processes|A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge. Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming. We illustrate this approach on a few domains and compare it with other exploration algorithms.|Pablo Samuel Castro,Doina Precup","16539|IJCAI|2007|Epistemic Reasoning in Logic Programs|Although epistemic logic programming has an enhanced capacity to handle complex incomplete information reasoning and represent agents' epistemic behaviours, it embeds a significantly higher computational complexity than non-disjunctive and disjunctive answer set programming.

In particular, we show that Lee and Lifschitz's result on loop formulas for disjunctive logic programs can be extended to a special class of epistemic logic programs. We also study the polysize model property for epistemic logic programs. Based on these discoveries, we identify two non-trivial classes of epistemic logic programs whose consistency checking complexity is reduced from PSPACE-complete to NP-complete and P -complete respectively. We observe that many important applications on epistemic representation fall into these two classes of epistemic logic programs.|Yan Zhang","16752|IJCAI|2007|A Description Logic of Change|We combine the modal logic S with the description logic (DL) ALCQI.

We then establish that a number of natural concept classes, including all the classes of monotone formulas that are PAC learnable by monotone formulas, and the classes of conjunctions, disjunctions, k-CNF, k-DNF, and linear thresholds, are consistently learnable from partial observations. We finally show that the concept classes of parities and monotone term -decision lists are not properly consistently learnable from partial observations, if RP  NP.

Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a nave Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likesdislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).|Giovanni Semeraro,Marco Degemmis,Pasquale Lops,Pierpaolo Basile","16801|IJCAI|2007|Common Sense Based Joint Training of Human Activity Recognizers|Given sensors to detect object use, commonsense priors of object usage in activities can reduce the need for labeled data in learning activity models.

In this paper we investigate the complexity of this diagnosability problem and the size of automata that perform diagnosis. There are algorithms for testing diagnosability in polynomial time in the number of states in the system. For succinct system representations, which may be exponentially smaller than the state space of the system, the diagnosability problem is consequently in EXPTIME. We show that this upper bound is not tight and that the decision problem is in fact PSPACE-complete. On-line diagnosis can be carried out by diagnosers which are automata that recognize faulty behavior. We show that diagnosers in the worst case have a size that is exponential in the number of states, both for explicit and succinct system representations.

Deterministic BA are readily emulated by conventional software, e.g., a script running in a Web browser. In general, nondeterministic BA may have no equivalent deterministic BA.

First, the nearest neighbors of a document belong to different classes in many cases since any pair of documents shares lots of \"general\" words. Second, the sparsity of class-specific \"core\" words leads to grouping documents with the same class labels into different clusters. Both problems can be resolved by suitable smoothing of document model and using Kullback-Leibler divergence of two smoothed models as pairwise document distances. Inspired by the recent work in information retrieval, we propose a novel context-sensitive semantic smoothing method that can automatically identifies multiword phrases in a document and then statistically map phrases to individual document terms. We evaluate the new model-based similarity measure on three datasets using complete linkage criterion for agglomerative clustering and find out it significantly improves the clustering quality over the traditional vector cosine measure.|Xiaohua Zhou,Xiaodan Zhang,Xiaohua Hu","16784|IJCAI|2007|A Flexible Unsupervised PP-Attachment Method Using Semantic Information|In this paper we revisit the classical NLP problem of prepositional phrase attachment (PP-attachment). Given the pattern V -NP-P-NP in the text, where V is verb, NP is a noun phrase, P is the preposition and NP is the other noun phrase, the question asked is where does P - NP attach V or NP This question is typically answered using both the word and the world knowledge. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Data Sparsity Reduction (DSR) are the two requirements for PP-attachment resolution. Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach. The unambiguous V - P - N and N - P -N tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N - P - N tuples of the test corpus. A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation (WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of Vs and Ns in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP, NP - P - NP. For experimentation, Brown Corpus provides the training data andWall Street Journal Corpus the test data. The accuracy obtained for PP-attachment resolution is close to %.

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a ,, Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of % on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly.

However, since LSI ignores class labels of training documents, LSI generated representations are not as effective in classification tasks. To address this limitation, a process called 'sprinkling' is presented. Sprinkling is a simple extension of LSI based on augmenting the set of features using additional terms that encode class knowledge. However, a limitation of sprinkling is that it treats all classes (and classifiers) in the same way. To overcome this, we propose a more principled extension called Adaptive Sprinkling (AS). AS leverages confusion matrices to emphasise the differences between those classes which are hard to separate. The method is tested on diverse classification tasks, including those where classes share ordinal or hierarchical relationships. These experiments reveal that AS can significantly enhance the performance of instance-based techniques (kNN) to make them competitive with the state-of-the-art SVM classifier. The revised representations generated by AS also have a favourable impact on SVM performance.|Sutanu Chakraborti,Rahman Mukras,Robert Lothian,Nirmalie Wiratunga,Stuart N. K. Watt,David J.

The most prominent comparison criteria are precision and recall originating from information retrieval. Precision and recall are thought of as some degree of correction and completeness of results. However, when the objects to compare are semantically defined, like ontologies and alignments, it can happen that a fully correct alignment has low precision. This is due to the restricted set-theoretic foundation of these measures. Drawing on previous syntactic generalizations of precision and recall, semantically justified measures that satisfy maximal precision and maximal recall for correct and complete alignments is proposed. These new measures are compatible with classical precision and recall and can be computed.|J√©r√¥me Euzenat","16377|IJCAI|2007|Improving Embeddings by Flexible Exploitation of Side Information|Dimensionality reduction is a much-studied task in machine learning in which high-dimensional data is mapped, possibly via a non-linear transformation, onto a low-dimensional manifold.

Incorrect or missing models lead to faulty plans usually characterized by catastrophic goal failure. Non-critical anomalies occur, however, when actual behavior during plan execution differs only slightly from expectations, and plans still achieve the given goal conjunct. Such anomalies provide the basis for model adjustments that represent small adaptations to the planner's background knowledge. In a multi-agent environment where  or more individual plans can be executing at any one time, automation is required to support model anomaly detection, evaluation and revision. We provide an agent-based algorithm that generates hypotheses about the cause of plan anomalies. This algorithm leverages historical plan data and a hierarchy of models in a novel integration of hypothesis generation and verification. Because many hypotheses can be generated by the software agents, we provide a mechanism where only the most important hypotheses are presented to a user as suggestions for model repair.|Alice M.

In this field, a conflict measure has been introduced to detect conflicts between a given probability distribution and associated data. In this paper, we use a probabilistic theory to represent logical diagnostic systems and show that in this theory we are able to determine consistent and inconsistent states as traditionally done in consistency-based diagnosis. Furthermore, we analyse how the conflict measure in this theory offers a way to favour particular diagnoses above others.

In our approach, we presume that each motor primitive takes responsibility for controlling a small sub-block of motion, containing coherent muscle activation outputs. A central timing controller cues these subroutines of movement, creating complete movement strategies that are built up by overlaying primitives, thus creating synergies of muscle activation. This partitioning allows the movement to be defined by a sparse code representing the timing of primitive activations. This paper shows that it is possible to use a factorial hidden Markov model to infer primitives in handwriting data. The variation in the handwriting data can to a large extent be explained by timing variation in the triggering of the primitives. Once an appropriate set of primitives has been inferred, the characters can be represented as a set of timings of primitive activations, along with variances, giving a very compact representation of the character. The model is naturally partitioned into a low level primitive output stage, and a top-down primitive timing stage. This partitioning gives us an insight into behaviours such as scribbling, and what is learnt in order to write a new character.|Ben H. Williams,Marc Toussaint,Amos J.

The learning algorithm is unsupervised, and follows a mixed bottom-uptop-down strategy, in which elementary facts in the sequences (motifs) are progressively grouped, thus building up the abstraction hierarchy of a S-HMM, layer after layer. The algorithm is validated on a suite of artificial datasets, where the challenge for the learning algorithm is to reconstruct the model that generated the data. Then, an application to a real problem of molecular biology is briefly described.|Ugo Galassi,Attilio Giordana,Lorenza Saitta","16429|IJCAI|2007|First Order Decision Diagrams for Relational MDPs|Markov decision processes capture sequential decision making under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions so as to optimize long term reward. The paper studies efficient reasoning mechanisms for Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDP) where world states have an internal relational structure that can be naturally described in terms of objects and relations among them. Two contributions are presented. First, the paper develops First Order Decision Diagrams (FODD), a new compact representation for functions over relational structures, together with a set of operators to combine FODDs, and novel reduction techniques to keep the representation small. Second, the paper shows how FODDs can be used to develop solutions for RMDPs, where reasoning is performed at the abstract level and the resulting optimal policy is independent of domain size (number of objects) or instantiation. In particular, a variant of the value iteration algorithm is developed by using special operations over FODDs, and the algorithm is shown to converge to the optimal policy.|Chenggang Wang,Saket Joshi,Roni Khardon"],["16492|IJCAI|2007|Completing Description Logic Knowledge Bases Using Formal Concept Analysis|We propose an approach for extending both the terminological and the assertional part of a Description Logic knowledge base by using information provided by the knowledge base and by a domain expert. The use of techniques from Formal Concept Analysis ensures that, on the one hand, the interaction with the expert is kept to a minimum, and, on the other hand, we can show that the extended knowledge base is complete in a certain, well-defined sense.|Franz Baader,Bernhard Ganter,Baris Sertkaya,Ulrike Sattler","16786|IJCAI|2007|An Extension to Conformant Planning Using Logic Programming|In this paper we extend the logic programming based conformant planner described in Son et al., a to allow it to work on planning problems with more complex descriptions of the initial states.

In earlier papers various advantages of P-log have been discussed. In this paper we further elaborate on the KR prowess of P-log by showing that (i) it can be used for causal and counterfactual reasoning and (ii) it provides an elaboration tolerant way for non-naive conditioning.|Chitta Baral,Matt Hunsaker","16582|IJCAI|2007|On Natural Language Processing and Plan Recognition|The research areas of plan recognition and natural language parsing share many common features and even algorithms. However, the dialog between these two disciplines has not been effective. Specifically, significant recent results in parsing mildly context sensitive grammars have not been leveraged in the state of the art plan recognition systems. This paper will outline the relations between natural language processing(NLP) and plan recognition(PR), argue that each of them can effectively inform the other, and then focus on key recent research results in NLP and argue for their applicability to PR.|Christopher W.

Several methods have been proposed to compile, possibly inconsistent, weighted or stratified bases. This paper focuses on the well-known linear order and possibilistic logic strategies. It provides a way for compiling a stratified belief base in order to be able to process inference from it in polynomial time. The resulting extra compilation cost is very low. In particular, the number of additional variables, that are added to original stratified bases, corresponds exactly to the number of priority levels existing in the base. Moreover, our compilation approach allows an efficient computation of weighted possibilistic conclusions and possibilistic conditioning.|Salem Benferhat,Safa Yahi,Habiba Drias","16698|IJCAI|2007|A Hybridized Planner for Stochastic Domains|Markov Decision Processes are a powerful framework for planning under uncertainty, but current algorithms have difficulties scaling to large problems. We present a novel probabilistic planner based on the notion of hybridizing two algorithms. In particular, we hybridize GPT, an exact MDP solver, with MBP, a planner that plans using a qualitative (nondeterministic) model of uncertainty. Whereas exact MDP solvers produce optimal solutions, qualitative planners sacrifice optimality to achieve speed and high scalability. Our hybridized planner, HYBPLAN, is able to obtain the best of both techniques -- speed, quality and scalability. Moreover, HYBPLAN has excellent anytime properties and makes effective use of available time and memory.|Mausam,Piergiorgio Bertoli,Daniel S. Weld","16621|IJCAI|2007|Solving POMDPs Using Quadratically Constrained Linear Programs|Developing scalable algorithms for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is an important challenge. One approach that effectively addresses the intractable memory requirements of POMDP algorithms is based on representing POMDP policies as finite-state controllers. In this paper, we illustrate some fundamental disadvantages of existing techniques that use controllers. We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques. The results open up promising research directions for solving large POMDPs using nonlinear programming methods.|Christopher Amato,Daniel S.

Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate well the value function. In contrast, Bellman and Kalaba,  proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming. We illustrate this approach on a few domains and compare it with other exploration algorithms.|Pablo Samuel Castro,Doina Precup","16397|IJCAI|2007|Planning under Risk and Knightian Uncertainty|Two noteworthy models of planning in AI are probabilistic planning (based on MDPs and its generalizations) and nondeterministic planning (mainly based on model checking).

However, it is often the case that a similarity function is unknown or chosen by hand. This paper introduces a formulation that given relative similarity comparisons among triples of points of the form object i is more like object j than object k, it constructs a kernel function that preserves the given relationships. Our approach is based on learning a kernel that is a combination of functions taken from a set of base functions (these could be kernels as well). The formulation is based on defining an optimization problem that can be solved using linear programming instead of a semidefinite program usually required for kernel learning. We show how to construct a convex problem from the given set of similarity comparisons and then arrive to a linear programming formulation by employing a subset of the positive definite matrices. We extend this formulation to consider representationevaluation efficiency based on formulating a novel form of feature selection using kernels (that is not much more expensive to solve). Using publicly available data, we experimentally demonstrate how the formulation introduced in this paper shows excellent performance in practice by comparing it with a baseline method and a related state-of-the art approach, in addition of being much more efficient computationally.|Glenn Fung,R√≥mer Rosales,R.
