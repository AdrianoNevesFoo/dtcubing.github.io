The increasing importance of top-k queries warrants an efficient support of ranking in the relational database management system (RDBMS) and has recently gained the attention of the research community. Top-k queries aim at providing only the top k query results, according to a user-specified ranking function, which in many cases is an aggregate of multiple criteria.

This technology poses many new challenges on current data management systems. RFID data are time-dependent, dynamically changing, in large volumes, and carry implicit semantics. RFID data management systems need to effectively support such large scale temporal data created by RFID applications. These systems need to have an explicit temporal data model for RFID data to support tracking and monitoring queries. In addition, they need to have an automatic method to transform the primitive observations from RFID readers into derived data used in RFID-enabled applications. In this paper, we present an integrated RFID data management system -- Siemens RFID Middleware -- based on an expressive temporal data model for RFID data. Our system enables semantic RFID data filtering and automatic data transformation based on declarative rules, provides powerful query support of RFID object tracking and monitoring, and can be adapted to different RFID-enabled applications.|Fusheng Wang,Peiya Liu","80552|VLDB|2005|A Dynamically Adaptive Distributed System for Processing Complex Continuous Queries|Recent years have witnessed rapidly growing research attention on continuous query processing over streams , . A continuous query system can easily run out of resources in case of large amount of input stream data. Distributed continuous query processing over a shared nothing architecture, i.e., a cluster of machines, has been recognized as a scalable method to solve this problem , , . Due to the lack of initial cost information and the fluctuating nature of the streaming data, uneven workload among machines may occur and this may impair the benefits of distributed processing.

Effective solutions have to be simultaneously spacetime efficient (at each remote monitor site), communication efficient (across the underlying communication network), and provide continuous, guaranteed-quality approximate query answers. In this paper, we propose novel algorithmic solutions for the problem of continuously tracking a broad class of complex aggregate queries in such a distributed-streams setting. Our tracking schemes maintain approximate query answers with provable error guarantees, while simultaneously optimizing the storage space and processing time at each remote site, and the communication cost across the network. They rely on tracking general-purpose randomized sketch summaries of local streams at remote sites along with concise prediction models of local site behavior in order to produce highly communication- and spacetime-efficient solutions. The result is a powerful approximate query tracking framework that readily incorporates several complex analysis queries (including distributed join and multi-join aggregates, and approximate wavelet representations), thus giving the first known low-overhead tracking solution for such queries in the distributed-streams model.|Graham Cormode,Minos N.

We present an extensible stream database system that allows scalable and flexible continuous queries on such streams. Application dependent streams and query functions are defined through an object-relational model. Distributed execution plans for continuous queries are described as high-level data flow distribution templates. Using a generic template we define two partitioning strategies for scalable parallel execution of expensive stream queries window split and window distribute. Window split provides operators for parallel execution of query functions by reducing the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluate these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that window split is favorable when expensive queries are executed on limited resources, while window distribution is better otherwise.|Milena Ivanova,Tore Risch","80485|VLDB|2005|Efficient Evaluation of XQuery over Streaming Data|With the growing popularity of XML and emergence of streaming data model, processing queries over streaming XML has become an important topic. This paper presents a new framework and a set of techniques for processing XQuery over streaming data. As compared to the existing work on supporting XPathXQuery over data streams, we make the following three contributions. We propose a series of optimizations which transform XQuery queries so that they can be correctly executed with a single pass on the dataset.. We present a methodology for determining when an XQuery query, possibly after the transformations we introduce, can be correctly executed with only a single pass on the dataset.. We describe a code generation approach which can handle XQuery queries with user-defined aggregates, including recursive functions. We aggressively use static analysis and generate executable code, i.e., do not require a query plan to be interpreted at runtime.We have evaluated our implementation using several XMark benchmarks and three other XQuery queries driven by real applications. Our experimental results show that as compared to QizxOpen, Saxon, and Galax, our system ) is at least % faster on XMark queries with small datasets, ) is significantly faster on XMark queries with larger datasets, ) at least one order of magnitude faster on the queries driven by real applications, as unlike other systems, we can transform them to execute with a single pass, and ) executes queries efficiently on large datasets when other systems often have memory overflows.|Xiaogang Li,Gagan Agrawal","80497|VLDB|2005|An Efficient SQL-based RDF Querying Scheme|Devising a scheme for efficient and scalable querying of Resource Description Framework (RDF) data has been an active area of current research. However, most approaches define new languages for querying RDF data, which has the following shortcomings ) They are difficult to integrate with SQL queries used in database applications, and ) They incur inefficiency as data has to be transformed from SQL to the corresponding language data format. This paper proposes a SQL based scheme that avoids these problems. Specifically, it introduces a SQL table function RDFMATCH to query RDF data. The results of RDFMATCH table function can be further processed by SQL's rich querying capabilities and seamlessly combined with queries on traditional relational data. Furthermore, the RDFMATCH table function invocation is rewritten as a SQL query, thereby avoiding run-time table function procedural overheads. It also enables optimization of rewritten query in conjunction with the rest of the query. The resulting query is executed efficiently by making use of B-tree indexes as well as specialized subject-property materialized views. This paper describes the functionality of the RDFMATCH table function for querying RDF data, which can optionally include user-defined rulebases, and discusses its implementation in Oracle RDBMS. It also presents an experimental study characterizing the overhead eliminated by avoiding procedural code at runtime, characterizing performance under various input conditions, and demonstrating scalability using  million RDF triples from UniProt protein and annotation data.|Eugene Inseok Chong,Souripriya Das,George Eadon,Jagannathan Srinivasan","80560|VLDB|2005|KLEE A Framework for Distributed Top-k Query Algorithms|This paper addresses the efficient processing of top-k queries in wide-area distributed data repositories where the index lists for the attribute values (or text terms) of a query are distributed across a number of data peers and the computational costs include network latency, bandwidth consumption, and local peer work.

KLEE makes a strong case for approximate top-k algorithms over widely distributed data sources. It shows how great gains in efficiency can be enjoyed at low result-quality penalties.

A number of methods have recently been proposed for privacy preserving data mining of multidimensional data records. One of the methods for privacy preserving data mining is that of anonymization, in which a record is released only if it is indistinguishable from k other entities in the data. We note that methods such as k-anonymity are highly dependent upon spatial locality in order to effectively implement the technique in a statistically robust way. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and the concept of spatial locality is no longer easy to define from an application point of view. In this paper, we view the k-anonymization problem from the perspective of inference attacks over all possible combinations of attributes. We show that when the data contains a large number of attributes which may be considered quasi-identifiers, it becomes difficult to anonymize the data without an unacceptably high amount of information loss. This is because an exponential number of combinations of dimensions can be used to make precise inference attacks, even when individual attributes are partially specified within a range. We provide an analysis of the effect of dimensionality on k-anonymity methods. We conclude that when a data set contains a large number of attributes which are open to inference attacks, we are faced with a choice of either completely suppressing most of the data or losing the desired level of anonymity. Thus, this paper shows that the curse of high dimensionality also applies to the problem of privacy preserving data mining.|Charu C.

An advanced text classification technique is known as partially supervised text classification, which can build a text classifier using a small set of positive examples only. This leads to our curiosity whether it is possible to find a set of features that can be used to describe the positive examples. Therefore, users do not even need to specify a set of positive examples. As the first step, in this paper, we formalize it as a new problem, called hot bursty events detection, to detect bursty events from a text stream which is a sequence of chronologically ordered documents. Here, a bursty event is a set of bursty features, and is considered as a potential category to build a text classifier. It is important to know that the hot bursty events detection problem, we study in this paper, is different from TDT (topic detection and tracking) which attempts to cluster documents as events using clustering techniques. In other words, our focus is on detecting a set of bursty features for a bursty event. In this paper, we propose a new novel parameter free probabilistic approach, called feature-pivot clustering. Our main technique is to fully utilize the time information to determine a set of bursty features which may occur in differenttime windows. We detect bursty events based on the feature distributions. There is no need to tune or estimate any parameters. We conduct experiments using real life data, a major English newspaper in Hong Kong, and show that the parameter free feature-pivot clustering approach can detect the bursty events with a high success rate.|Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung,Jeffrey Xu Yu,Philip S.

Unfortunately, many modern OLAP systems do not use that functionality or replicate a great deal of it in addition to other database-related functionality. In fact, the gap between the functionality provided by an OLAP system and the functionality used from the underlying database systems has widened in the past, rather than narrowed.

However, query operators that work with multiple streams, such as stream merge or join, can often still block if one of the input stream is very slow or bursty. In principle, punctuation and heartbeat mechanisms have been proposed to unblock streaming operators. In practice, it is a challenge to incorporate such mechanisms into a high-performance stream management system that is operational in an industrial application.In this paper, we introduce a system for punctuation-carrying heartbeat generation that we developed for Gigascope, a high-performance streaming database for network monitoring, that is operationally used within AT&T's IP backbone. We show how heartbeats can be regularly generated by low-level nodes in query execution plans and propagated upward unblocking all streaming operators on its way. Additionally, our heartbeat mechanism can be used for other applications in distributed settings such as detecting node failures, performance monitoring, and query optimization. A performance evaluation using live data feeds shows that our system is capable of working at multiple Gigabit line speeds in a live, industrial deployment and can significantly decrease the query memory utilization.|Theodore Johnson,S.

XML is a de-facto standard for content publishing and data exchange. The proliferation of XML documents has created new challenges and opportunities for managing document collections. Existing technologies for automatically organizing document collections are either imprecise or based on only simple criteria. Since XML documents are self describing, it is now possible to automatically categorize XML documents precisely, according to their content. With the availability of the standard XML query languages, e.g. XQuery, much more powerful folder technologies are now feasible. To address this new challenge and exploit this new opportunity, this paper proposes a new and powerful dynamic folder mechanism, called Hubble. Hubble fully exploits the rich data model and semantic information embedded in the XML documents to build folder hierarchies dynamically and to categorize XML collections precisely. Besides supporting basic folder operations, Hubble also provides advanced features such as multi-path navigation and folder traversal across multiple document collections. Our performance study shows that Hubble is both efficient and scalable.

To handle these files data processing logic is reinvented inside each application. This results in a jungle of data processing solutions and a jungle of data and file formats. For a user, it is extremely hard to manage information in this jungle. Most of all it is impossible to use data distributed among different files and formats for combined queries, e.g., join and union operations. To solve the problems arising from file based data management, we present a software system called iMeMex as a unified solution to personal information management and integration. iMeMex is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Our system enables existing applications to gradually dispose file based storage. By using iMeMex modern operating systems are enabled to make use of sophisticated DBMS, IR and data integration technologies. The seamless integration of iMeMex into existing operating systems enables new applications that provide concepts of data storage and analysis unseen before.|Jens-Peter Dittrich,Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles,Donald Kossmann,Lukas Blunschi","80556|VLDB|2005|The Integrated Microbial Genomes IMG System A Case Study in Biological Data Management|Biological data management includes the traditional areas of data generation, acquisition, modelling, integration, and analysis.

Thus, a forthcoming version of DB Universal Database&reg is enhanced with comprehensive native XML support. \"Native\" means that XML documents are stored on disk pages in tree structures matching the XML data model. This avoids the mapping between XML and relational structures, and the corresponding limitations. The native XML storage is complemented with XML indexes, full XQuery, SQLXML, and XML Schema support, as well as utilities such as a parallel high-speed XML bulk loader.

Due to continuous changes in these values, and limited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), it is often infeasible for the database to store the exact values at all times. Queries that uses these old values can produce invalid results. In order to manage the uncertainty between the actual sensor value and the database value, we propose a system called U-DBMS. U-DBMS extends the database system with uncertainty management functionalities. In particular, each data value is represented as an interval and a probability distribution function, and it can be processed with probabilistic query operators to produce imprecise (but correct) answers. This demonstration presents a PostgreSQL-based system that handles uncertainty and probabilistic queries for constantly-evolving data.|Reynold Cheng,Sarvjeet Singh,Sunil Prabhakar","80468|VLDB|2005|ULoad Choosing the Right Storage for Your XML Application|A key factor for the outstanding success of database management systems is physical data independence queries, and application programs, are able to refer to the data at the logical level, ignoring the details on how the data is physically stored and accessed by the system.

However, data distributions can be \"viewed\" in different ways. A data stream of integer values can be viewed either as the forward distribution f (x), ie., the number of occurrences of x in the stream, or as its inverse, f- (i), which is the number of items that appear i times. While both such \"views\" are equivalent in stored data systems, over data streams that entail approximations, they may be significantly different. In other words, samples and sketches developed for the forward distribution may be ineffective for summarizing or mining the inverse distribution. Yet, many applications such as IP traffic monitoring naturally rely on mining inverse distributions.We formalize the problems of managing and mining inverse distributions and show provable differences between summarizing the forward distribution vs the inverse distribution. We present methods for summarizing and mining inverse distributions of data streams they rely on a novel technique to maintain a dynamic sample over the stream with provable guarantees which can be used for variety of summarization tasks (building quantiles or equidepth histograms) and mining (anomaly detection finding heavy hitters, and measuring the number of rare items), all with provable guarantees on quality of approximations and timespace used by our streaming methods.We also complement our analytical and algorithmic results by presenting an experimental study of the methods over network data streams.|Graham Cormode,S.

The approach is based on our algorithm for rewriting XPATH queries into regular XPATH expressions, which are capable of capturing both DTD recursion and XPATH queries in a uniform framework. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm for translating regular XPATH queries to SQL queries with LFP, and optimization techniques for minimizing the use of the LFP operator. The novelty of our approach consists in its capability to answer a large class of XPATH queries by means of only low-end RDBMS features already available in most RDBMS.

Focusing on e-science, it can be observed that scientific experiments and observations in many fields, e. g., in physics and astronomy, create huge volumes of data which have to be interchanged and processed. With experimental and observational data coming in particular from sensors, online simulations, etc., the data has an inherently streaming nature. Furthermore, continuing advances will result in even higher data volumes, rendering storing all of the delivered data prior to processing increasingly impractical. Hence, in such e-science scenarios, processing and sharing of data streams will play a decisive role. It will enable new possibilities for researchers, since they will be able to subscribe to interesting data streams of other scientists without having to set up their own devices or experiments. This results in much better utilization of expensive equipment such as telescopes, satellites, etc. Further, processing and sharing data streams on-the-fly in the network helps to reduce network traffic and to avoid network congestion. Thus, even huge streams of data can be handled efficiently by removing unnecessary parts early on, e. g., by early filtering and aggregation, and by sharing previously generated data streams and processing results.|Richard Kuntschke,Bernhard Stegmaier,Alfons Kemper,Angelika Reiser","80533|VLDB|2005|Customizable Parallel Execution of Scientific Stream Queries|Scientific applications require processing high-volume on-line streams of numerical data from instruments and simulations.

Distributed execution plans for continuous queries are described as high-level data flow distribution templates. Using a generic template we define two partitioning strategies for scalable parallel execution of expensive stream queries window split and window distribute. Window split provides operators for parallel execution of query functions by reducing the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluate these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that window split is favorable when expensive queries are executed on limited resources, while window distribution is better otherwise.|Milena Ivanova,Tore Risch","80537|VLDB|2005|A Heartbeat Mechanism and Its Application in Gigascope|Data stream management systems often rely on ordering properties of tuple attributes in order to implement non-blocking operators. However, query operators that work with multiple streams, such as stream merge or join, can often still block if one of the input stream is very slow or bursty. In principle, punctuation and heartbeat mechanisms have been proposed to unblock streaming operators. In practice, it is a challenge to incorporate such mechanisms into a high-performance stream management system that is operational in an industrial application.In this paper, we introduce a system for punctuation-carrying heartbeat generation that we developed for Gigascope, a high-performance streaming database for network monitoring, that is operationally used within AT&T's IP backbone. We show how heartbeats can be regularly generated by low-level nodes in query execution plans and propagated upward unblocking all streaming operators on its way. Additionally, our heartbeat mechanism can be used for other applications in distributed settings such as detecting node failures, performance monitoring, and query optimization. A performance evaluation using live data feeds shows that our system is capable of working at multiple Gigabit line speeds in a live, industrial deployment and can significantly decrease the query memory utilization.|Theodore Johnson,S.

Existing polynomial-time thresholding schemes that minimize maximum error metrics are disadvantaged by impracticable time and space complexities and are not applicable in a data stream context. This is a cardinal issue, as the problem at hand in its most practically interesting form involves the time-efficient approximation of huge amounts of data, potentially in a streaming environment.

A number of methods have recently been proposed for privacy preserving data mining of multidimensional data records. One of the methods for privacy preserving data mining is that of anonymization, in which a record is released only if it is indistinguishable from k other entities in the data. We note that methods such as k-anonymity are highly dependent upon spatial locality in order to effectively implement the technique in a statistically robust way. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and the concept of spatial locality is no longer easy to define from an application point of view. In this paper, we view the k-anonymization problem from the perspective of inference attacks over all possible combinations of attributes. We show that when the data contains a large number of attributes which may be considered quasi-identifiers, it becomes difficult to anonymize the data without an unacceptably high amount of information loss. This is because an exponential number of combinations of dimensions can be used to make precise inference attacks, even when individual attributes are partially specified within a range. We provide an analysis of the effect of dimensionality on k-anonymity methods. We conclude that when a data set contains a large number of attributes which are open to inference attacks, we are faced with a choice of either completely suppressing most of the data or losing the desired level of anonymity. Thus, this paper shows that the curse of high dimensionality also applies to the problem of privacy preserving data mining.|Charu C.

One of the methods for privacy preserving data mining is that of anonymization, in which a record is released only if it is indistinguishable from k other entities in the data. We note that methods such as k-anonymity are highly dependent upon spatial locality in order to effectively implement the technique in a statistically robust way. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and the concept of spatial locality is no longer easy to define from an application point of view. In this paper, we view the k-anonymization problem from the perspective of inference attacks over all possible combinations of attributes. We show that when the data contains a large number of attributes which may be considered quasi-identifiers, it becomes difficult to anonymize the data without an unacceptably high amount of information loss. This is because an exponential number of combinations of dimensions can be used to make precise inference attacks, even when individual attributes are partially specified within a range. We provide an analysis of the effect of dimensionality on k-anonymity methods. We conclude that when a data set contains a large number of attributes which are open to inference attacks, we are faced with a choice of either completely suppressing most of the data or losing the desired level of anonymity. Thus, this paper shows that the curse of high dimensionality also applies to the problem of privacy preserving data mining.|Charu C.

In the recent years, a significant number of papers have appeared which has advanced the state-of-the-art in synopsis construction considerably.

It is extremely valuable to discuss and analyze these techniques, and we expect broader pictures and paradigms to emerge.

Examples of functionality that has been added are top N , ranking , , spreadsheet computations , grouping sets , data cube , and moving sums  in order to name just a few. Unfortunately, many modern OLAP systems do not use that functionality or replicate a great deal of it in addition to other database-related functionality. In fact, the gap between the functionality provided by an OLAP system and the functionality used from the underlying database systems has widened in the past, rather than narrowed. The reasons for this trend are that SQL as a data definition and query language, the relational model, and the clientserver architecture of the current generation of database products have fundamental shortcomings for OLAP. This paper lists these deficiencies and presents the BTell OLAP engine as an example on how to bridge these shortcomings.

The extreme case of this is relational OLAP environments, where, for performance reasons, nearly all levels of aggregation across all dimensions may be computed and stored in MVs. Furthermore, base tables and MVs are usually partitioned for ease and speed of maintenance. In these scenarios, updates to the base table are done using Bulk or Partition operations like add, exchange, truncate and drop partition. If changes to base tables can be tracked at the partition level, join dependencies. functional dependencies and query rewrite can be used to optimize refresh of an individual MV. The refresh optimizer, in the presence of partitioned tables and MVs, may recognize dependencies between base table and the MV partitions leading to the generation of very efficient refresh expressions. Additionally, in the presence of multiple MVs, the refresh subsytem can come up with an optimal refresh schedule such that MVs can be refreshed using query rewrite against previously refreshed MVs. This makes the database server more manageable and user friendly since a single function call can optimally refresh all the MVs in the system.|Nathan Folkert,Abhinav Gupta,Andrew Witkowski,Sankar Subramanian,Srikanth Bellamkonda,Shrikanth Shankar,Tolga Bozkaya,Lei Sheng","80479|VLDB|2005|Designing Information-Preserving Mapping Schemes for XML|An XML-to-relational mapping scheme consists of a procedure for shredding documents into relational databases, a procedure for publishing databases back as documents, and a set of constraints the databases must satisfy. In previous work, we defined two notions of information preservation for mapping schemes losslessness, which guarantees that any document can be reconstructed from its corresponding database and validation, which requires every legal database to correspond to a valid document. We also described one information-preserving mapping scheme, called Edge++, and showed that, under reasonable assumptions, losslessness and validation are both undecidable. This leads to the question we study in this paper how to design mapping schemes that are information-preserving. We propose to do it by starting with a scheme known to be information-preserving and applying to it equivalence-preserving transformations written in weakly recursive ILOG. We study an instance of this framework, the LILO algorithm, and show that it provides significant performance improvements over Edge++ and introduces constraints that are efficiently enforced in practice.|Denilson Barbosa,Juliana Freire,Alberto O.

The assumption is that popularity is closely correlated with quality, a more elusive concept that is difficult to measure directly. Unfortunately, the correlation between popularity and quality is very weak for newly-created pages that have yet to receive many visits andor in-links. Worse, since discovery of new content is largely done by querying search engines, and because users usually focus their attention on the top few results, newly-created but high-quality pages are effectively \"shut out,\" and it can take a very long time before they become popular.We propose a simple and elegant solution to this problem the introduction of a controlled amount of randomness into search result ranking methods. Doing so offers new pages a chance to prove their worth, although clearly using too much randomness will degrade result quality and annul any benefits achieved. Hence there is a tradeoff between exploration to estimate the quality of new pages and exploitation of pages already known to be of high quality. We study this tradeoff both analytically and via simulation, in the context of an economic objective function based on aggregate result quality amortized over time. We show that a modest amount of randomness leads to improved search results.|Sandeep Pandey,Sourashis Roy,Christopher Olston,Junghoo Cho,Soumen Chakrabarti"],["80480|VLDB|2005|Benefits of Path Summaries in an XML Query Optimizer Supporting Multiple Access Methods|We compare several optimization strategies implemented in an XML query evaluation system.

While many processing methods have already been proposed for such queries, none of them has found its way to any of the existing \"lightweight\" XML engines (i.e. engines without optimization modules). The main reason is the lack of a systematic comparison of query methods under a common storage model. In this work, we aim to fill this gap and answer two important questions what the relative similarities and important differences among the tree-pattern query methods are, and if there is a prominent method among them in terms of effectiveness and robustness that an XML processor should support. For the first question, we propose a novel classification of the methods according to their matching process. We then describe a common storage model and demonstrate that the access pattern of each class conforms or can be adapted to conform to this model. Finally, we perform an experimental evaluation to compare their relative performance.

The novelty of our approach consists in its capability to answer a large class of XPATH queries by means of only low-end RDBMS features already available in most RDBMS.

Previous techniques have been inadequate, because they have focused mainly on the tag-labeled paths (tree structure) of the XML data. For most real XML data, the number of distinct string values at the leaf nodes is orders of magnitude larger than the set of distinct rooted tag paths. Hence, the real challenge lies in accurate selectivity estimation of the string predicates on the leaf values reachable via a given path.In this paper, we present CXHist, a novel workload-aware histogram technique that provides accurate selectivity estimation on a broad class of XML string-based queries. CXHist builds a histogram in an on-line manner by grouping queries into buckets using their true selectivity obtained from query feedback. The set of queries associated with each bucket is summarized into feature distributions. These feature distributions mimic a Bayesian classifier that is used to route a query to its associated bucket during selectivity estimation. We show how CXHist can be used for two general types of path, string queries exact match queries and substring match queries. Experiments using a prototype show that CXHist provides accurate selectivity estimation for both exact match queries and substring match queries.|Lipyeow Lim,Min Wang,Jeffrey Scott Vitter"],["80572|VLDB|2005|Large Scale Data Warehouses on Grid Oracle Database g and HP ProLiant Systems|Grid computing has the potential to drastically change enterprise computing as we know it today.

This paper uses a formally-defined notion of k-anonymity to measure disclosure by views, where k  is a positive integer. Intuitively, violation of k-anonymity occurs when a particular attribute value of an entity can be determined to be among less than k possibilities by using the views together with the schema information of the private table. The paper shows that, in general, whether a set of views violates k-anonymity is a computationally hard problem. Subcases are identified and their computational complexities discussed. Especially interesting are those subcases that yield polynomial checking algorithms (in the number of tuples in the views).

Window split provides operators for parallel execution of query functions by reducing the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size.

In this system, necessary changes are pushed from sources to repositories and from repositories to clients so that they are automatically informed about the changes of interest. Clients and repositories associate coherence requirements with a data item d, denoting the maximum permissible deviation of the value of d known to them from the value at the source. Given a list of data item, coherence served by each repository and a set of client, data item, coherence requests, we address the following problem How do we assign clients to the repositories, so that the fidelity, that is, the degree to which client coherence requirements are met, is maximizedIn this paper, we first prove that the client assignment problem is NP-Hard. Given the closeness of the client-repository assignment problem and the matching problem in combinatorial optimization, we have tailored and studied two available solutions to the matching problem from the literature (i) max-flow min-cost and (ii) stable-marriages. Our empirical results using real-world dynamic data show that the presence of coherence requirements adds a new dimension to the client-repository assignment problem. An interesting result is that in update intensive situations a better fidelity can be delivered to the clients by attempting to deliver data to some of the clients at a coherence lower than what they desire. A consequence of this observation is the necessity for quick adaptation of the delivered (vs. desired) data coherence with respect to the changes in the dynamics of the system.

In a recent past, the synopsis techniques have gained more currency due to the emerging areas like data stream management.In this tutorial, we propose to revisit algorithms for Wavelet and Histogram synopsis construction. In the recent years, a significant number of papers have appeared which has advanced the state-of-the-art in synopsis construction considerably. In particular, we have seen the development of a large number of efficient algorithms which are also guaranteed to be near optimal. Furthermore, these synopsis construction problems have found deep roots in theory and database systems, and have influenced a wide range of problems. In a different level, a large number of the synopsis construction algorithms use a similar set of techniques. It is extremely valuable to discuss and analyze these techniques, and we expect broader pictures and paradigms to emerge. This would allow us to develop algorithms for newer problems with greater ease. Understanding these recurrent themes and intuition behind the development of these algorithms is one of the main thrusts of the tutorial.Our goal will be to cover a wide spectrum of these topics and make the researchers in VLDB community aware of the new algorithms, optimum or approximate, offline or streaming. The tutorial will be self contained and develop most of the mathematical and database backgrounds needed.|Sudipto Guha,Kyuseok Shim","80594|VLDB|2005|Efficient Computation of the Skyline Cube|Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for multi-criteria decision making, data mining and visualization, and user-preference queries. In this paper. we consider the problem of efficiently computing a SKYCUBE, which consists of skylines of all possible non-empty subsets of a given set of dimensions. While existing skyline computation algorithms can be immediately extended to computing each skyline query independently, such \"shared-nothing\" algorithms are inefficient. We develop several computation sharing strategies based on effectively identifying the computation dependencies among multiple related skyline queries. Based on these sharing strategies, two novel algorithms, Bottom-Up and Top-Down algorithms, are proposed to compute SKYCUBE efficiently. Finally, our extensive performance evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the sharing strategies.

We address the meta-data indexing problem of efficiently identifying the XML elements along a location step in an XPath query, that satisfy meta-data range constraints. Our system, named MIX, incorporates query processing on all XPath axes suitably enhanced with meta-data features offering not only query answering but also dynamic maintenance of meta-data levels for XML documents.|SungRan Cho,Nick Koudas,Divesh Srivastava","80557|VLDB|2005|Mapping Maintenance for Data Integration Systems|To answer user queries, a data integration system employs a set of semantic mappings between the mediated schema and the schemas of data sources. In dynamic environments sources often undergo changes that invalidate the mappings. Hence, once the system is deployed, the administrator must monitor it over time, to detect and repair broken mappings. Today such continuous monitoring is extremely labor intensive, and poses a key bottleneck to the widespread deployment of data integration systems in practice.We describe MAVERIC, an automatic solution to detecting broken mappings. At the heart of MAVERIC is a set of computationally inexpensive modules called sensors, which capture salient characteristics of data sources (e.g., value distributions, HTML layout properties). We describe how MAVERIC trains and deploys the sensors to detect broken mappings. Next we develop three novel improvements perturbation (i.e., injecting artificial changes into the sources) and multi-source training to improve detection accuracy, and filtering to further reduce the number of false alarms. Experiments over  real-world sources in six domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our sensor-based approach over existing solutions, as well as the utility of our improvements.|Robert McCann,Bedoor K.

In this paper, information preservation for XML is formally studied, and the results of this study guide the definition of a novel notion of schema embedding between two XML DTD schemas represented as graphs. Schema embedding generalizes the conventional notion of graph similarity by allowing an edge in a source DTD schema to be mapped to a path in the target DTD. Instance-level embeddings can be defined from the schema embedding in a straightforward manner, such that conformance to a target schema and information preservation are guaranteed. We show that it is NP-complete to find an embedding between two DTD schemas. We also provide efficient heuristic algorithms to find candidate embeddings, along with experimental results to evaluate and compare the algorithms. These yield the first systematic and effective approach to finding information preserving XML mappings.|Philip Bohannon,Wenfei Fan,Michael Flaster,P. P. S.

The domain user must then tune the system select the right component to be executed and correctly adjust their numerous \"knobs\" (e.g., thresholds, formula coefficients). Tuning is skill- and time-intensive, but (as we show) without it the matching accuracy is significantly inferior.We describe eTuner, an approach to automatically tune schema matching systems. Given a schema S, we match S against synthetic schemas, for which the ground truth mapping is known, and find a tuning that demonstrably improves the performance of matching S against real schemas. To efficiently search the huge space of tuning configurations, eTuner works sequentially, starting with tuning the lowest level components. To increase the applicability of eTuner, we develop methods to tune a broad range of matching components. While the tuning process is completely automatic, eTuner can also exploit user assistance (whenever available) to further improve the tuning quality. We employed eTuner to tune four recently developed matching systems on several real-world domains. eTuner produced tuned matching systems that achieve higher accuracy than using the systems with currently possible tuning methods, at virtually no cost to the domain user.|Mayssam Sayyadian,Yoonkyong Lee,AnHai Doan,Arnon Rosenthal","80471|VLDB|2005|Indexing Data-oriented Overlay Networks|The application of structured overlay networks to implement index structures for data-oriented applications such as peer-to-peer databases or peer-to-peer information retrieval, requires highly efficient approaches for overlay construction, as changing application requirements frequently lead to re-indexing of the data and hence (re)construction of overlay networks. This problem has so far not been addressed in the literature and thus we describe an approach for the efficient construction of data-oriented, structured overlay networks from scratch in a self-organized way. Standard maintenance algorithms for overlay networks cannot accomplish this efficiently, as they are inherently sequential. Our proposed algorithm is completely decentralized, parallel, and can construct a new overlay network with short latency. At the same time it ensures good load-balancing for skewed data key distributions which result from preserving key order relationships as necessitated by data-oriented applications. We provide both a theoretical analysis of the basic algorithms and a complete system implementation that has been tested on PlanetLab.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to process a twig query based on region encoding labeling scheme. While region encoding supports efficient determination of structural relationship between two elements, we observe that the information within a single label is very limited. In this paper, we propose a new labeling scheme, called extended Dewey. This is a powerful labeling scheme, since from the label of an element alone, we can derive all the elements names along the path from the root to the element. Based on extended Dewey, we design a novel holistic twig join algorithm, called TJFast. Unlike all previous algorithms based on region encoding, to answer a twig query, TJFast only needs to access the labels of the leaf query nodes. Through this, not only do we reduce disk access, but we also support the efficient evaluation of queries with wildcards in branching nodes, which is very difficult to be answered by algorithms based on region encoding. Finally, we report our experimental results to show that our algorithms are superior to previous approaches in terms of the number of elements scanned, the size of intermediate results and query performance.|Jiaheng Lu,Tok Wang Ling,Chee Yong Chan,Ting Chen","80488|VLDB|2005|On Map-Matching Vehicle Tracking Data|Vehicle tracking data is an essential \"raw\" material for a broad range of applications such as traffic management and control, routing, and navigation. An important issue with this data is its accuracy. The method of sampling vehicular movement using GPS is affected by two error sources and consequently produces inaccurate trajectory data. To become useful, the data has to be related to the underlying road network by means of map matching algorithms. We present three such algorithms that consider especially the trajectory nature of the data rather than simply the current position as in the typical map-matching case. An incremental algorithm is proposed that matches consecutive portions of the trajectory to the road network, effectively trading accuracy for speed of computation. In contrast, the two global algorithms compare the entire trajectory to candidate paths in the road network. The algorithms are evaluated in terms of (i) their running time and (ii) the quality of their matching result. Two novel quality measures utilizing the Fr&eacutechet distance are introduced and subsequently used in an experimental evaluation to assess the quality of matching real tracking data to a road network.|Sotiris Brakatsoulas,Dieter Pfoser,Randall Salas,Carola Wenk","80479|VLDB|2005|Designing Information-Preserving Mapping Schemes for XML|An XML-to-relational mapping scheme consists of a procedure for shredding documents into relational databases, a procedure for publishing databases back as documents, and a set of constraints the databases must satisfy. In previous work, we defined two notions of information preservation for mapping schemes losslessness, which guarantees that any document can be reconstructed from its corresponding database and validation, which requires every legal database to correspond to a valid document. We also described one information-preserving mapping scheme, called Edge++, and showed that, under reasonable assumptions, losslessness and validation are both undecidable. This leads to the question we study in this paper how to design mapping schemes that are information-preserving. We propose to do it by starting with a scheme known to be information-preserving and applying to it equivalence-preserving transformations written in weakly recursive ILOG. We study an instance of this framework, the LILO algorithm, and show that it provides significant performance improvements over Edge++ and introduces constraints that are efficiently enforced in practice.|Denilson Barbosa,Juliana Freire,Alberto O.

Yet in many cases structural information is available and can be used to match such data. As a running example we use residential address information. Addresses are hierarchical structures and are present in many databases. Often they are the best, if not only, relationship between autonomous data sources. Typically the matching has to be approximate since the representations in the sources differ.We propose pq-grams to approximately match hierarchical information from autonomous sources. We define the pq-gram distance between ordered labeled trees as an effective and efficient approximation of the well-known tree edit distance. We analyze the properties of the pq-gram distance and compare it with the edit distance and alternative approximations.

Intuitively, violation of k-anonymity occurs when a particular attribute value of an entity can be determined to be among less than k possibilities by using the views together with the schema information of the private table. The paper shows that, in general, whether a set of views violates k-anonymity is a computationally hard problem. Subcases are identified and their computational complexities discussed. Especially interesting are those subcases that yield polynomial checking algorithms (in the number of tuples in the views).

The extreme case of this is relational OLAP environments, where, for performance reasons, nearly all levels of aggregation across all dimensions may be computed and stored in MVs. Furthermore, base tables and MVs are usually partitioned for ease and speed of maintenance. In these scenarios, updates to the base table are done using Bulk or Partition operations like add, exchange, truncate and drop partition. If changes to base tables can be tracked at the partition level, join dependencies. functional dependencies and query rewrite can be used to optimize refresh of an individual MV. The refresh optimizer, in the presence of partitioned tables and MVs, may recognize dependencies between base table and the MV partitions leading to the generation of very efficient refresh expressions. Additionally, in the presence of multiple MVs, the refresh subsytem can come up with an optimal refresh schedule such that MVs can be refreshed using query rewrite against previously refreshed MVs. This makes the database server more manageable and user friendly since a single function call can optimally refresh all the MVs in the system.|Nathan Folkert,Abhinav Gupta,Andrew Witkowski,Sankar Subramanian,Srikanth Bellamkonda,Shrikanth Shankar,Tolga Bozkaya,Lei Sheng"],["80518|VLDB|2005|ConQuer A System for Efficient Querying Over Inconsistent Databases|Although integrity constraints have long been used to maintain data consistency, there are situations in which they may not be enforced or satisfied.

DITN uses an alternate intra-fragment parallelism where each node executes an independent select-project-join-aggregate-group by block, with no tuple exchange between nodes. This method cleanly handles heterogeneous nodes, and well adapts during execution to node failures or load spikes.Initial experiments suggest that DITN performs competitively with a traditional configuration of dedicated machines and well-partitioned data for up to  processors at least.

However, most approaches define new languages for querying RDF data, which has the following shortcomings ) They are difficult to integrate with SQL queries used in database applications, and ) They incur inefficiency as data has to be transformed from SQL to the corresponding language data format. This paper proposes a SQL based scheme that avoids these problems. Specifically, it introduces a SQL table function RDFMATCH to query RDF data. The results of RDFMATCH table function can be further processed by SQL's rich querying capabilities and seamlessly combined with queries on traditional relational data. Furthermore, the RDFMATCH table function invocation is rewritten as a SQL query, thereby avoiding run-time table function procedural overheads. It also enables optimization of rewritten query in conjunction with the rest of the query. The resulting query is executed efficiently by making use of B-tree indexes as well as specialized subject-property materialized views.

The difficulties in applying the existing top-k algorithms to XML data lie in ) the need to consider scores for XML elements while aggregating them at the document level, ) the combination of vague content conditions with XML path conditions, ) the need to relax query conditions if too few results satisfy all conditions, and ) the selectivity estimation for both content and structure conditions and their impact on evaluation strategies. TopX addresses these issues by precomputing score and path information in an appropriately designed index structure, by largely avoiding or postponing the evaluation of expensive path conditions so as to preserve the sequential access pattern on index lists, and by selectively scheduling random accesses when they are cost-beneficial. In addition, TopX can compute approximate top-k results using probabilistic score estimators, thus speeding up queries with a small and controllable loss in retrieval precision.|Martin Theobald,Ralf Schenkel,Gerhard Weikum","80565|VLDB|2005|Why Search Engines are Used Increasingly to Offload Queries from Databases|The development of future search engine technology is no longer limited to free text.

As a result, more efforts have been deployed to provide XML full-text search that combines querying structure with complex conditions on text ranging from simple keyword search to sophisticated proximity search composed with stemming and thesaurus. However, one of the key challenges in full-text search is to match users' expectations and determine the most relevant answers to a full-text query. In this context, we propose query personalization as a way to take user profiles into account in order to customize query answers based on individual users' needs.We present PIMENT, a system that enables query personalization by query rewriting and answer ranking. PIMENT is composed of a profile repository that stores user profiles, a query customizer that rewrites user queries based on user profiles and, a ranking module to rank query answers.|Sihem Amer-Yahia,Irini Fundulaki,Prateek Jain,Laks V.

Text is associated with nodes and possibly edges. Keyword search on such graphs has received much attention lately. A central problem in this scenario is to efficiently extract from the data graph a small number of the \"best\" answer trees. A Backward Expanding search, starting at nodes matching keywords and working up toward confluent roots, is commonly used for predominantly text-driven queries. But it can perform poorly if some keywords match many nodes, or some node has very large degree.In this paper we propose a new search algorithm, Bidirectional Search, which improves on Backward Expanding search by allowing forward search from potential roots towards leaves. To exploit this flexibility, we devise a novel search frontier prioritization technique based on spreading activation. We present a performance study on real data, establishing that Bidirectional Search significantly outperforms Backward Expanding search.|Varun Kacholia,Shashank Pandit,Soumen Chakrabarti,S.

The assumption is that popularity is closely correlated with quality, a more elusive concept that is difficult to measure directly. Unfortunately, the correlation between popularity and quality is very weak for newly-created pages that have yet to receive many visits andor in-links. Worse, since discovery of new content is largely done by querying search engines, and because users usually focus their attention on the top few results, newly-created but high-quality pages are effectively \"shut out,\" and it can take a very long time before they become popular.We propose a simple and elegant solution to this problem the introduction of a controlled amount of randomness into search result ranking methods. Doing so offers new pages a chance to prove their worth, although clearly using too much randomness will degrade result quality and annul any benefits achieved. Hence there is a tradeoff between exploration to estimate the quality of new pages and exploitation of pages already known to be of high quality. We study this tradeoff both analytically and via simulation, in the context of an economic objective function based on aggregate result quality amortized over time. We show that a modest amount of randomness leads to improved search results.|Sandeep Pandey,Sourashis Roy,Christopher Olston,Junghoo Cho,Soumen Chakrabarti"],["80597|VLDB|2005|Light-weight Domain-based Form Assistant Querying Web Databases On the Fly|The Web has been rapidly \"deepened\" by myriad searchable databases online, where data are hidden behind query forms. Helping users query alternative \"deep Web\" sources in the same domain (e.g., Books, Airfares) is an important task with broad applications. As a core component of those applications, dynamic query translation (i.e., translating a user's query across dynamically selected sources) has not been extensively explored. While existing works focus on isolated subproblems (e.g., schema matching, query rewriting) to study, we target at building a complete query translator and thus face new challenges ) To complete the translator, we need to solve the predicate mapping problem (i.e., map a source predicate to target predicates), which is largely unexplored by existing works ) To satisfy our application requirements, we need to design a customizable system architecture to assemble various components addressing respective subproblems (i.e., schema matching, predicate mapping, query rewriting). Tackling these challenges, we develop a light-weight domain-based form assistant, which can generally handle alternative sources in the same domain and is easily customizable to new domains.

However, query operators that work with multiple streams, such as stream merge or join, can often still block if one of the input stream is very slow or bursty. In principle, punctuation and heartbeat mechanisms have been proposed to unblock streaming operators. In practice, it is a challenge to incorporate such mechanisms into a high-performance stream management system that is operational in an industrial application.In this paper, we introduce a system for punctuation-carrying heartbeat generation that we developed for Gigascope, a high-performance streaming database for network monitoring, that is operationally used within AT&T's IP backbone. We show how heartbeats can be regularly generated by low-level nodes in query execution plans and propagated upward unblocking all streaming operators on its way. Additionally, our heartbeat mechanism can be used for other applications in distributed settings such as detecting node failures, performance monitoring, and query optimization. A performance evaluation using live data feeds shows that our system is capable of working at multiple Gigabit line speeds in a live, industrial deployment and can significantly decrease the query memory utilization.|Theodore Johnson,S.

Application dependent streams and query functions are defined through an object-relational model. Distributed execution plans for continuous queries are described as high-level data flow distribution templates. Using a generic template we define two partitioning strategies for scalable parallel execution of expensive stream queries window split and window distribute. Window split provides operators for parallel execution of query functions by reducing the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluate these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that window split is favorable when expensive queries are executed on limited resources, while window distribution is better otherwise.|Milena Ivanova,Tore Risch","80493|VLDB|2005|Loadstar Load Shedding in Data Stream Mining|In this demo, we show that intelligent load shedding is essential in achieving optimum results in mining data streams under various resource constraints.

Loadstar uses a novel metric known as the quality of decision (QoD) to measure the level of uncertainty in classification. Resources are then allocated to sources where uncertainty is high. To make optimum classification decisions and accurate QoD measurement, Loadstar relies on feature prediction to model the data dropped by the load shedding mechanism. Furthermore, Loadstar is able to adapt to the changing data characteristics in data streams. The system thus offers a nice solution to data mining with resource constraints.|Yun Chi,Haixun Wang,Philip S.

An important issue with this data is its accuracy. The method of sampling vehicular movement using GPS is affected by two error sources and consequently produces inaccurate trajectory data. To become useful, the data has to be related to the underlying road network by means of map matching algorithms. We present three such algorithms that consider especially the trajectory nature of the data rather than simply the current position as in the typical map-matching case. An incremental algorithm is proposed that matches consecutive portions of the trajectory to the road network, effectively trading accuracy for speed of computation. In contrast, the two global algorithms compare the entire trajectory to candidate paths in the road network.

Clients and repositories associate coherence requirements with a data item d, denoting the maximum permissible deviation of the value of d known to them from the value at the source. Given a list of data item, coherence served by each repository and a set of client, data item, coherence requests, we address the following problem How do we assign clients to the repositories, so that the fidelity, that is, the degree to which client coherence requirements are met, is maximizedIn this paper, we first prove that the client assignment problem is NP-Hard. Given the closeness of the client-repository assignment problem and the matching problem in combinatorial optimization, we have tailored and studied two available solutions to the matching problem from the literature (i) max-flow min-cost and (ii) stable-marriages. Our empirical results using real-world dynamic data show that the presence of coherence requirements adds a new dimension to the client-repository assignment problem. An interesting result is that in update intensive situations a better fidelity can be delivered to the clients by attempting to deliver data to some of the clients at a coherence lower than what they desire. A consequence of this observation is the necessity for quick adaptation of the delivered (vs. desired) data coherence with respect to the changes in the dynamics of the system.

We design and implement a mapping adaptation system based on mapping composition as well as additional mapping pruning techniques that significantly speed up the adaptation. We conduct comprehensive experimental analysis and show that the composition approach is practical in various evolution scenarios. The mapping language that we consider is a nested relational extension of the second-order dependencies of Fagin et al . Our work can also be seen as an implementation of the mapping composition operator of the model management framework.|Cong Yu,Lucian Popa","80475|VLDB|2005|Interactive Schema Translation with Instance-Level Mappings|We demonstrate a prototype that translates schemas from a source metamodel (e.g., OO, relational, XML) to a target metamodel. The prototype is integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio  to generate relational schemas from an object-oriented design. It has four novel features. First, it produces instance mappings to round-trip the data between the source schema and the generated target schema. It compiles the instance mappings into SQL views to reassemble the objects stored in relational tables. Second, it offers interactive editing, i.e., incremental modifications of the source schema yield incremental modifications of the target schema. Third, it incorporates a novel mechanism for mapping inheritance hierarchies to relations, which supports all known strategies and their combinations. Fourth, it is integrated with a commercial product featuring a high-quality user interface. The schema translation process is driven by high-level rules that eliminate constructs that are absent from the target metamodel.|Philip A. Bernstein,Sergey Melnik,Peter Mork","80486|VLDB|2005|Information Preserving XML Schema Embedding|A fundamental concern of information integration in an XML context is the ability to embed one or more source documents in a target document so that (a) the target document conforms to a target schema and (b) the information in the source document(s) is preserved. In this paper, information preservation for XML is formally studied, and the results of this study guide the definition of a novel notion of schema embedding between two XML DTD schemas represented as graphs. Schema embedding generalizes the conventional notion of graph similarity by allowing an edge in a source DTD schema to be mapped to a path in the target DTD. Instance-level embeddings can be defined from the schema embedding in a straightforward manner, such that conformance to a target schema and information preservation are guaranteed. We show that it is NP-complete to find an embedding between two DTD schemas. We also provide efficient heuristic algorithms to find candidate embeddings, along with experimental results to evaluate and compare the algorithms. These yield the first systematic and effective approach to finding information preserving XML mappings.|Philip Bohannon,Wenfei Fan,Michael Flaster,P. P. S.

The domain user must then tune the system select the right component to be executed and correctly adjust their numerous \"knobs\" (e.g., thresholds, formula coefficients). Tuning is skill- and time-intensive, but (as we show) without it the matching accuracy is significantly inferior.We describe eTuner, an approach to automatically tune schema matching systems. Given a schema S, we match S against synthetic schemas, for which the ground truth mapping is known, and find a tuning that demonstrably improves the performance of matching S against real schemas. To efficiently search the huge space of tuning configurations, eTuner works sequentially, starting with tuning the lowest level components. To increase the applicability of eTuner, we develop methods to tune a broad range of matching components. While the tuning process is completely automatic, eTuner can also exploit user assistance (whenever available) to further improve the tuning quality. We employed eTuner to tune four recently developed matching systems on several real-world domains. eTuner produced tuned matching systems that achieve higher accuracy than using the systems with currently possible tuning methods, at virtually no cost to the domain user.|Mayssam Sayyadian,Yoonkyong Lee,AnHai Doan,Arnon Rosenthal","80479|VLDB|2005|Designing Information-Preserving Mapping Schemes for XML|An XML-to-relational mapping scheme consists of a procedure for shredding documents into relational databases, a procedure for publishing databases back as documents, and a set of constraints the databases must satisfy. In previous work, we defined two notions of information preservation for mapping schemes losslessness, which guarantees that any document can be reconstructed from its corresponding database and validation, which requires every legal database to correspond to a valid document. We also described one information-preserving mapping scheme, called Edge++, and showed that, under reasonable assumptions, losslessness and validation are both undecidable. This leads to the question we study in this paper how to design mapping schemes that are information-preserving. We propose to do it by starting with a scheme known to be information-preserving and applying to it equivalence-preserving transformations written in weakly recursive ILOG. We study an instance of this framework, the LILO algorithm, and show that it provides significant performance improvements over Edge++ and introduces constraints that are efficiently enforced in practice.|Denilson Barbosa,Juliana Freire,Alberto O.

This technology poses many new challenges on current data management systems. RFID data are time-dependent, dynamically changing, in large volumes, and carry implicit semantics. RFID data management systems need to effectively support such large scale temporal data created by RFID applications. These systems need to have an explicit temporal data model for RFID data to support tracking and monitoring queries. In addition, they need to have an automatic method to transform the primitive observations from RFID readers into derived data used in RFID-enabled applications. In this paper, we present an integrated RFID data management system -- Siemens RFID Middleware -- based on an expressive temporal data model for RFID data. Our system enables semantic RFID data filtering and automatic data transformation based on declarative rules, provides powerful query support of RFID object tracking and monitoring, and can be adapted to different RFID-enabled applications.|Fusheng Wang,Peiya Liu","80557|VLDB|2005|Mapping Maintenance for Data Integration Systems|To answer user queries, a data integration system employs a set of semantic mappings between the mediated schema and the schemas of data sources. In dynamic environments sources often undergo changes that invalidate the mappings. Hence, once the system is deployed, the administrator must monitor it over time, to detect and repair broken mappings. Today such continuous monitoring is extremely labor intensive, and poses a key bottleneck to the widespread deployment of data integration systems in practice.We describe MAVERIC, an automatic solution to detecting broken mappings. At the heart of MAVERIC is a set of computationally inexpensive modules called sensors, which capture salient characteristics of data sources (e.g., value distributions, HTML layout properties). We describe how MAVERIC trains and deploys the sensors to detect broken mappings. Next we develop three novel improvements perturbation (i.e., injecting artificial changes into the sources) and multi-source training to improve detection accuracy, and filtering to further reduce the number of false alarms. Experiments over  real-world sources in six domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our sensor-based approach over existing solutions, as well as the utility of our improvements.|Robert McCann,Bedoor K.

The Loadstar system introduces load shedding techniques to classifying multiple data streams of large volume and high speed. Loadstar uses a novel metric known as the quality of decision (QoD) to measure the level of uncertainty in classification. Resources are then allocated to sources where uncertainty is high. To make optimum classification decisions and accurate QoD measurement, Loadstar relies on feature prediction to model the data dropped by the load shedding mechanism. Furthermore, Loadstar is able to adapt to the changing data characteristics in data streams. The system thus offers a nice solution to data mining with resource constraints.|Yun Chi,Haixun Wang,Philip S.

However, different subsets of the data can sometimes have very different statistical properties. In such scenarios it can be more efficient to process different subsets of the data for a query using different plans. We propose a new query processing technique called content-based routing (CBR) that eliminates the single-plan restriction in current systems. We present low-overhead adaptive algorithms that partition input data based on statistical properties relevant to query execution strategies, and efficiently route individual tuples through customized plans based on their partition. We have implemented CBR as an extension to the Eddies query processor in the TelegraphCQ system, and we present an extensive experimental evaluation showing the significant performance benefits of CBR.|Pedro Bizarro,Shivnath Babu,David J.

This paper presents a new framework and a set of techniques for processing XQuery over streaming data. As compared to the existing work on supporting XPathXQuery over data streams, we make the following three contributions. We propose a series of optimizations which transform XQuery queries so that they can be correctly executed with a single pass on the dataset.. We present a methodology for determining when an XQuery query, possibly after the transformations we introduce, can be correctly executed with only a single pass on the dataset.. We describe a code generation approach which can handle XQuery queries with user-defined aggregates, including recursive functions. We aggressively use static analysis and generate executable code, i.e., do not require a query plan to be interpreted at runtime.We have evaluated our implementation using several XMark benchmarks and three other XQuery queries driven by real applications. Our experimental results show that as compared to QizxOpen, Saxon, and Galax, our system ) is at least % faster on XMark queries with small datasets, ) is significantly faster on XMark queries with larger datasets, ) at least one order of magnitude faster on the queries driven by real applications, as unlike other systems, we can transform them to execute with a single pass, and ) executes queries efficiently on large datasets when other systems often have memory overflows.|Xiaogang Li,Gagan Agrawal","80471|VLDB|2005|Indexing Data-oriented Overlay Networks|The application of structured overlay networks to implement index structures for data-oriented applications such as peer-to-peer databases or peer-to-peer information retrieval, requires highly efficient approaches for overlay construction, as changing application requirements frequently lead to re-indexing of the data and hence (re)construction of overlay networks. This problem has so far not been addressed in the literature and thus we describe an approach for the efficient construction of data-oriented, structured overlay networks from scratch in a self-organized way. Standard maintenance algorithms for overlay networks cannot accomplish this efficiently, as they are inherently sequential. Our proposed algorithm is completely decentralized, parallel, and can construct a new overlay network with short latency. At the same time it ensures good load-balancing for skewed data key distributions which result from preserving key order relationships as necessitated by data-oriented applications. We provide both a theoretical analysis of the basic algorithms and a complete system implementation that has been tested on PlanetLab. We use this implementation to support peer-to-peer information retrieval and database applications.|Karl Aberer,Anwitaman Datta,Manfred Hauswirth,Roman Schmidt","80593|VLDB|2005|WmXML A System for Watermarking XML Data|As increasing amount of data is published in the form of XML, copyright protection of XML data is becoming an important requirement for many applications. While digital watermarking is a widely used measure to protect digital data from copyright offences, the complex and flexible construction of XML data poses a number of challenges to digital watermarking, such as re-organization and alteration attacks. To overcome these challenges, the watermarking scheme has to be based on the usability of data and the underlying semantics like key attributes and functional dependencies. In this paper, we describe WmXML, a system for watermarking XML documents. It generates queries from essential semantics to identify the available watermarking bandwidth in XML documents, and integrates query rewriting technique to overcome the threats from data re-organization and alteration. In the demonstration, we will showcase the use of WmXML and its effectiveness in countering various attacks.|Xuan Zhou,HweeHwa Pang,Kian-Lee Tan,Dhruv Mangla","80488|VLDB|2005|On Map-Matching Vehicle Tracking Data|Vehicle tracking data is an essential \"raw\" material for a broad range of applications such as traffic management and control, routing, and navigation. An important issue with this data is its accuracy. The method of sampling vehicular movement using GPS is affected by two error sources and consequently produces inaccurate trajectory data. To become useful, the data has to be related to the underlying road network by means of map matching algorithms. We present three such algorithms that consider especially the trajectory nature of the data rather than simply the current position as in the typical map-matching case. An incremental algorithm is proposed that matches consecutive portions of the trajectory to the road network, effectively trading accuracy for speed of computation. In contrast, the two global algorithms compare the entire trajectory to candidate paths in the road network. The algorithms are evaluated in terms of (i) their running time and (ii) the quality of their matching result. Two novel quality measures utilizing the Fr&eacutechet distance are introduced and subsequently used in an experimental evaluation to assess the quality of matching real tracking data to a road network.|Sotiris Brakatsoulas,Dieter Pfoser,Randall Salas,Carola Wenk","80489|VLDB|2005|OLAP Over Uncertain and Imprecise Data|We extend the OLAP data model to represent data ambiguity, specifically imprecision and uncertainty, and introduce an allocation-based approach to the semantics of aggregation queries over such data.

While there is much work on representing and querying ambiguous data, to our knowledge this is the first paper to handle both imprecision and uncertainty in an OLAP setting.|Douglas Burdick,Prasad Deshpande,T.

Yet in many cases structural information is available and can be used to match such data. As a running example we use residential address information. Addresses are hierarchical structures and are present in many databases. Often they are the best, if not only, relationship between autonomous data sources. Typically the matching has to be approximate since the representations in the sources differ.We propose pq-grams to approximately match hierarchical information from autonomous sources. We define the pq-gram distance between ordered labeled trees as an effective and efficient approximation of the well-known tree edit distance. We analyze the properties of the pq-gram distance and compare it with the edit distance and alternative approximations. Experiments with synthetic and real world data confirm the analytic results and the scalability of our approach.|Nikolaus Augsten,Michael H. Böhlen,Johann Gamper"]]}}
