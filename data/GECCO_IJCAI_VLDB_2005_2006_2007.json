However, they remain unsatisfactory when the environment modelled is partially observable. There are pathological examples where no history of fixed length is sufficient for accurate prediction or decision making. On the other hand, working with a hidden state (like in Hidden Markov Models or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) has a high computational cost. In order to circumvent this problem, we suggest the use of a context-based model. Our approach replaces strict transition probabilities by influences on transitions. The method proposed provides a trade-off between a fully and partially observable model. We also discuss the capacity of our framework to model hierarchical knowledge and abstraction.

In this paper, we extend TD networks by allowing the network-update process (answer network) to depend on the recent history of previous actions and observations rather than only on the most recent action and observation. We show that this extension enables the solution of a larger class of problems than can be solved by the original TD networks or by history-based methods alone. In addition, we apply TD networks to a problem that, while still simple, is significantly larger than has previously been considered. We show that history-extended TD networks can learn much of the common-sense knowledge of an egocentric gridworld domain with a single bit of perception.|Brian Tanner,Richard S.

Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","57629|GECCO|2006|GRASP - evolution for constraint satisfaction problems|There are several evolutionary approaches for solving random binary Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs).

We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques.

Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme.

A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications.

Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities. Missing this opportunity will be worse than missing the Internet.

In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized.

Because the virtual view is in the relational format, users can query the data and the knowledge in a seamlessly integrated manner. To facilitate knowledge representation and inferencing within the database engine, our approach leverages XML support in hybrid relational-XML DBMSs (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server & IBM DB  PureXML).

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs.

As a result, MeSwarm integrates the standard PSO with the Solis and Wets local search strategy to avoid the overshooting problem and that is based on the recent probability of success to efficiently generate a new candidate solution around the current particle. Thus, six test functions and a real-world optimization problem, the flexible protein-ligand docking problem are used to validate the performance of MeSwarm. The experimental results indicate that MeSwarm outperforms the standard PSO and several evolutionary algorithms in terms of solution quality.|Bo-Fu Liu,Hung-Ming Chen,Jian-Hung Chen,Shiow-Fen Hwang,Shinn-Ying Ho","57589|GECCO|2005|Molecular programming evolving genetic programs in a test tube|We present a molecular computing algorithm for evolving DNA-encoded genetic programs in a test tube.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.|Ingo Mierswa","57329|GECCO|2005|Improving particle swarm optimization with differentially perturbed velocity|This paper introduces a novel scheme of improving the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO) by a vector differential operator borrowed from differential evolution (DE).

Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.|Jesse Hoey,Pascal Poupart","16190|IJCAI|2005|An MCMC Approach to Solving Hybrid Factored MDPs|Hybrid approximate linear programming (HALP) has recently emerged as a promising framework for solving large factored Markov decision processes (MDPs) with discrete and continuous state and action variables.

All of these use reachability analysis and heuristics to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches fully exploit the graphical features of the MDPs or use these features to yield the best backup sequence of the state space.

Data management continues to grow, more than doubling in data and transaction volumes every two years with a growth in deployments to fuel a $ billion market. A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications. While data management growth will continue based primarily on the relational data model and conventional DBMSs, a much larger and more challenging data management world is emerging. In the 's data under DBMS management reached % of the world's data. The six-fold growth of non-relational data in the period -- will reduce that number to well below %. We are entering the next generation of computing with a fundamentally different computing model and paradigm characterized technologically by multi-core architectures, virtualization, service-oriented computing, and the semantic web. Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities. Missing this opportunity will be worse than missing the Internet. The semantic web will become the means by which information is accessed and managed with modest projections of  billion pages with hundreds of triples per page - the largest distributed system in the world - the only one. Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web Consortium view databases are being nodes that need to be turned inside out. What does the database community think Semantic web services will constitute a programming model of Computer Science .. How does data management fit into this semantically rich environment Computer Science . offers the data management community one of the biggest challenges in its forty-year history and opens up a new world of data management.

To handle these files data processing logic is reinvented inside each application. This results in a jungle of data processing solutions and a jungle of data and file formats. For a user, it is extremely hard to manage information in this jungle. Most of all it is impossible to use data distributed among different files and formats for combined queries, e.g., join and union operations. To solve the problems arising from file based data management, we present a software system called iMeMex as a unified solution to personal information management and integration. iMeMex is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Our system enables existing applications to gradually dispose file based storage. By using iMeMex modern operating systems are enabled to make use of sophisticated DBMS, IR and data integration technologies. The seamless integration of iMeMex into existing operating systems enables new applications that provide concepts of data storage and analysis unseen before.|Jens-Peter Dittrich,Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles,Donald Kossmann,Lukas Blunschi","80628|VLDB|2006|Efficiently Linking Text Documents with Relevant Structured Information|Faced with growing knowledge management needs, enterprises are increasingly realizing the importance of interlinking critical business information distributed across structured and unstructured data sources.

EROCS views the structured data as a predefined set of \"entities\" and identifies the entities that best match the given document. EROCS also embeds the identified entities in the document, effectively creating links between the structured data and segments within the document. Unlike prior approaches, EROCS identifies such links even when the relevant entity is not explicitly mentioned in the document. EROCS uses an efficient algorithm that performs this task keeping the amount of information retrieved from the database at a minimum.

Interestingly, until now no approach was proposed that is able to represent all of the above data in a single, powerful yet simple data model. This paper fills this gap. We present the iMeMex Data Model (iDM) for personal information management. iDM is able to represent unstructured, semi-structured and structured data inside a single model. Moreover, iDM is powerful enough to represent graph-structured data, intensional data as well as infinite data streams. Further, our model enables to represent the structural information available inside files. As a consequence, the artifical boundary between inside and outside a file is removed to enable a new class of queries. As iDM allows the representation of the whole personal dataspace  of a user in a single model, it is the foundation of the iMeMex Personal Dataspace Management System (PDSMS) , , .

In sharp contrast to standard information integration architectures, a dataspace management system is a data-coexistence approach it does not require any investments in semantic integration before querying services on the data are provided. Rather, a dataspace can be gradually enhanced over time by defining relationships among the data. Defining those integration semantics gradually is termed pay-as-you-go information integration , as time and effort (pay) are needed over time (go) to provide integration semantics. The benefits are better query results (gain). This paper is the first to explore pay-as-you-go information integration in dataspaces. We provide a technique for declarative pay-as-you-go information integration named iTrails. The core idea of our approach is to declaratively add lightweight 'hints' (trails) to a search engine thus allowing gradual enrichment of loosely integrated data sources. Our experiments confirm that iTrails can be efficiently implemented introducing only little overhead during query execution. At the same time iTrails strongly improves the quality of query results. Furthermore, we present rewriting and pruning techniques that allow us to scale iTrails to tens of thousands of trail definitions with minimal growth in the rewritten query size.|Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles,Jens-Peter Dittrich,Shant Kirakos Karakashian,Olivier René Girard,Lukas Blunschi","80707|VLDB|2006|Load Shedding in Stream Databases A Control-Based Approach|In Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs), query processing has to meet various Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs. It is also robust and bears negligible computational overhead.|Yi-Cheng Tu,Song Liu,Sunil Prabhakar,Bin Yao"],["16757|IJCAI|2007|EQL-Lite Effective First-Order Query Processing in Description Logics|Querying Description Logic knowledge bases has received great attention in the last years.

Due to this feature, we have to deal with two conflicting needs on the one hand, we would like to query the knowledge base with sophisticated mechanisms provided by full first-order logic (FOL) on the other hand, the presence of incomplete information makes query answering a much more difficult task than in databases. In this paper we advocate the use of a nonmonotonic epistemic FOL query language as a means for expressing sophisticated queries over Description Logic knowledge bases. We show that through a controlled use of the epistemic operator, resulting in the language called EQL-Lite, we are able to formulate full FOL queries over Description Logic knowledge bases, while keeping computational complexity of query answering under control. In particular, we show that EQL-Lite queries over DL-Lite knowledge bases are FOL reducible (i.e., compilable into SQL) and hence can be answered in LOGSPACE through standard database technologies.|Diego Calvanese,Giuseppe De Giacomo,Domenico Lembo,Maurizio Lenzerini,Riccardo Rosati","16492|IJCAI|2007|Completing Description Logic Knowledge Bases Using Formal Concept Analysis|We propose an approach for extending both the terminological and the assertional part of a Description Logic knowledge base by using information provided by the knowledge base and by a domain expert.

Instead, many systems frequently employ multiple instances of induction separately.

The paper's main contribution is the integration of an epistemic approach to reasoning about knowledge with inverse entailment during induction. The new approach facilitates a systematic approach to the sharing of knowledge and invention of predicates only when required. We illustrate the approach using the well-known path planning problem and compare results empirically to (multiple instances of) single agent-based induction over varying distributions of data. Given a chosen path planning algorithm, our algorithm enables agents to combine their local knowledge in an effective way to avoid central control while significantly reducing communication costs.|Jian Huang,Adrian R.

They either cast rules into classical logic or limit the interaction between rules and ontologies. Autoepistemic logic (AEL) is an attractive formalismwhich allows to overcome these limitations, by serving as a uniform host language to embed ontologies and nonmonotonic logic programs into it. For the latter, so far only the propositional setting has been considered. In this paper, we present several embeddings of normal and disjunctive non-ground logic programs under the stable-model semantics into first-order AEL, and compare them in combination with classical theories, with respect to stable expansions and autoepistemic consequences. Our results reveal differences and correspondences of the embeddings and provide a useful guidance in the choice of a particular embedding for knowledge combination.|Jos de Bruijn,Thomas Eiter,Axel Polleres,Hans Tompits","16160|IJCAI|2005|Equivalence in Abductive Logic|We consider the problem of identifying equivalence of two knowledge bases which are capable of abductive reasoning. Here, a knowledge base is written in either first-order logic or nonmonotonic logic programming. In this work, we will give two definitions of abductive equivalence. The first one, explainable equivalence, requires that two abductive programs have the same explainability for any observation. Another one, explanatory equivalence, guarantees that any observation has exactly the same explanations in each abductive framework. Explanatory equivalence is a stronger notion than explainable equivalence. In first-order abduction, explainable equivalence can be verified by the notion of extensional equivalence in default theories. In nonmonotonic logic programs, explanatory equivalence can be checked by means of the notion of relative strong equivalence. We also show the complexity results for abductive equivalence.|Katsumi Inoue,Chiaki Sakama","16539|IJCAI|2007|Epistemic Reasoning in Logic Programs|Although epistemic logic programming has an enhanced capacity to handle complex incomplete information reasoning and represent agents' epistemic behaviours, it embeds a significantly higher computational complexity than non-disjunctive and disjunctive answer set programming.

In particular, we show that Lee and Lifschitz's result on loop formulas for disjunctive logic programs can be extended to a special class of epistemic logic programs. We also study the polysize model property for epistemic logic programs. Based on these discoveries, we identify two non-trivial classes of epistemic logic programs whose consistency checking complexity is reduced from PSPACE-complete to NP-complete and P -complete respectively.

Propositional logic formulas are thus associated with weights belonging to a linearly ordered scale. However, especially in case of multiple source information, only partial knowledge may be available about the relative ordering between weights of formulas. In order to cope with this problem, a two-sorted counterpart of possibilistic logic is introduced. Pieces of information are encoded as clauses where special literals refer to the weights. Constraints between weights translate into logical formulas of the corresponding sort and are gathered in a distinct auxiliary knowledge base. An inference relation, which is sound and complete with respect to preferential model semantics, enables us to draw plausible conclusions from the two knowledge bases. The inference process is characterized by using \"forgetting variables\" for handling the symbolic weights, and hence an inference process is obtained by means of a DNF compilation of the two knowledge bases.|Salem Benferhat,Henri Prade"],["57958|GECCO|2007|Dendritic cells for SYN scan detection|Artificial immune systems have previously been applied to the problem of intrusion detection.

We propose that gene libraries encourage diversity in a population of solutions and that the number of components in the gene library parameterises this effect. The number of gene libraries used is found to affect solution fitness and indeed using larger numbers of libraries (and therefore libraries of smaller components) enables higher fitness to be attained. We conclude that gene libraries are likely to be of use in applications where there is a need to maintain the diversity of solutions.|Peter Spellward,Tim Kovacs","58189|GECCO|2007|Extended thymus action for reducing false positives in ais based network intrusion detection systems|One of the major problems faced by anomaly based Network Intrusion Detection (NID) systems is the high number of false positives.

Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents.

The aim of solving such problems is to obtain solutions that in terms of objectives and feasibility are as good as possible and at the same time are least sensitive to the parameter variations. Such solutions are said to be robust optimum solutions. In order to investigate the trade-off between the performance and robustness of optimum solutions, we present a new Robust Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (RMOGA) that optimizes two objectives a fitness value and a robustness index. The fitness value serves as a measure of performance of design solutions with respect to multiple objectives and feasibility of the original optimization problem. The robustness index, which is based on a non-gradient based parameter sensitivity estimation approach, is a measure that quantitatively evaluates the robustness of design solutions. RMOGA does not require a presumed probability distribution of uncontrollable parameters and also does not utilize the gradient information of these parameters. Three distance metrics are used to obtain the robustness index and robust solutions. To illustrate its application, RMOGA is applied to two well-studied engineering design problems from the literature.|Mian Li,Shapour Azarm,Vikrant Aute","57976|GECCO|2007|A discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm for the generalized traveling salesman problem|Dividing the set of nodes into clusters in the well-known traveling salesman problem results in the generalized traveling salesman problem which seeking a tour with minimum cost passing through only a single node from each cluster.

However, the development of SANNs has traditionally focused on data domains that are assumed to be modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The analysis of data governed by other statistical models, such as the Poisson distribution, has received less attention from the data mining community. Based on special considerations of the statistical nature of data following a Poisson distribution, this paper introduces a SANN, Poisson-based Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (PSOTA), which implements novel similarity matching criteria and neuron weight adaptation schemes. It was tested on synthetic and real world data (serial analysis of gene expression data). PSOTA-based data analysis supported the automated identification of more meaningful clusters. By visualizing the dendrograms generated by PSOTA, complex inter- and intra-cluster relationships encoded in the data were also highlighted and readily understood. This study indicate that, in comparison to the traditional Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm (SOTA), PSOTA offers significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization in data modeled by the Poisson distribution, such as serial analysis of gene expression data.|Haiying Wang,Huiru Zheng,Francisco Azuaje","57769|GECCO|2006|Inference of genetic networks using S-system information criteria for model selection|In this paper we present an evolutionary approach for inferring the structure and dynamics in gene circuits from observed expression kinetics.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries.

Redundantly stored information can lead not just to a higher data storage cost, but also to increased costs for data transfer and data manipulation. Furthermore, such data redundancies can lead to potential update anomalies, rendering the database inconsistent.One way to avoid data redundancies is to employ good schema design based on known functional dependencies. In fact, several recent studies have focused on defining the notion of XML Functional Dependencies (XML FDs) to capture XML data redundancies. We observe further that XML databases are often \"casually designed\" and XML FDs may not be determined in advance. Under such circumstances, discovering XML data redundancies (in terms of FDs) from the data itself becomes necessary and is an integral part of the schema refinement process.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first system, DiscoverXFD, for effcient discovery of XML data redundancies. It employs a novel XML data structure and introduces a new class of partition based algorithms. DiscoverXFD can not only be used for the previous definitions of XML functional dependencies, but also for a more comprehensive notion we develop in this paper, capable of detecting redundancies involving set elements while maintaining clear semantics.

They are simple, easy to understand and inspire confidence. Many of these HAs are good for some problem instances while very poor for other cases. While Meta-Heuristics try to find which is the best heuristic andor parameters to apply for a given problem instance Hyper-Heuristics (HH) try to combine several heuristics in the same solution searching process, switching among them whenever the circumstances vary. Besides, instead to solve a single problem instance it tries to find a general algorithm to apply to whole families of problems. HH use evolutionary methods to search for such a problem-solving algorithm and, once produced, to apply it to any new problem instance desired. Learning Classifier Systems (LCS), and in particular XCS, represents an elegant and simple way to try to fabricate such a composite algorithm. This represents a different kind of problem to those already studied by the LCS community. Previous work, using single step environments, already showed the usefulness of the approach. This paper goes further and studies the novel use of multi-step environments for HH and an alternate way to consider states to see if chains of actions can be learnt. A non-trivial, NP-hard family of problems, the Bin Packing one, is used as benchmark for the procedure. Results of the approach are very encouraging, showing outperformance over all HAs used individually and over previously reported work by the authors, including non-LCS (a GA based approach used for the same BP set of problems) and LCS (using single step environments).|Javier G.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times.

Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies.

Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents.

This research investigates interactions among selfish, rational, and autonomous agents in resource allocation, each with incomplete information about other entities, and each seeking to maximize its expected utility. This paper presents a proportional resource allocation mechanism and gives a game theoretical analysis of the optimal strategies and the analysis shows the existence of equilibrium in the incomplete information setting. By augmenting the resource allocation mechanism with a deal optimization mechanism, trading agents can be programmed to optimize resource allocation results by updating beliefs and resubmitting bids. Experimental results showed that by having a deal optimization stage, the resource allocation mechanism produced generally optimistic outcomes (close to market equilibrium).|Bo An,Chunyan Miao,Zhiqi Shen","80708|VLDB|2006|Similarity Search A Matching Based Approach|Similarity search is a crucial task in multimedia retrieval and data mining. Most existing work has modelled this problem as the nearest neighbor (NN) problem, which considers the distance between the query object and the data objects over a fixed set of features. Such an approach has two drawbacks ) it leaves many partial similarities uncovered ) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the k-n-match problem in this paper.The k-n-match problem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the data objects in n dimensions, where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and these n dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objects returned in the answer set match best. The k-n-match query is expected to be superior to the kNN query in discovering partial similarities, however, it may not be as good in identifying full similarity since a single value of n may only correspond to a particular aspect of an object instead of the entirety. To address this problem, we further introduce the frequent k-n-match problem, which finds a set of objects that appears in the k-n-match answers most frequently for a range of n values. Moreover, we propose search algorithms for both problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of individual attributes retrieved, which is especially useful for information retrieval from multiple systems. We can also apply the proposed algorithmic strategy to achieve a disk based algorithm for the (frequent) k-n-match query. By a thorough experimental study using both real and synthetic data sets, we show that ) the k-n-match query yields better result than the kNN query in identifying similar objects by partial similarities ) our proposed method (for processing the frequent k-n-match query) outperforms existing techniques for similarity search in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.|Anthony K.

We applied the complementary similarity measure (CSM) to determine a hierarchical structure of word meanings. The CSM is a similarity measure developed for recognizing degraded machine-printed text. There are CSMs for both binary and gray-scale images. The CSM for binary images has been applied to estimate one-to-many relations, such as superordinate-subordinate relations, and to extract word hierarchies. However, the CSM for gray-scale images has not been applied to natural language processing. Here, we apply the latter to extract word hierarchies from corpora. To do this, we used frequency information for co-occurring words, which is not considered when using the CSM for binary images. We compared our hierarchies with those obtained using the CSM for binary images, and evaluated them by measuring their degree of agreement with the EDR electronic dictionary.|Eiko Yamamoto,Kyoko Kanzaki,Hitoshi Isahara","57557|GECCO|2005|Improvements to penalty-based evolutionary algorithms for the multi-dimensional knapsack problem using a gene-based adaptive mutation approach|Knapsack problems are among the most common problems in literature tackled with evolutionary algorithms (EA). Their major advantage lies in the fact that they are relatively simple to implement while they allow generalizations for a wide range of real world problems. The multi-dimensional knapsack problem (MKP), which belongs to the class of NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, is one of the variations of the knapsack problem. The MKP has a wide range of real world applications such as cargo loading, selecting projects to fund, budget management, cutting stock, etc. The MKP has been studied quite extensively in the EA community. Due to the constrained nature of the problem, constraint handling techniques gain great importance in the performance of the proposed EA approaches. In this study, the applicability of a generational EA that uses a penalty-based constraint handling technique and a gene locus based, asymmetric, adaptive mutation scheme is explored for the MKP. The effects of the parameters of the explored approach is determined through tests. Further experiments, using large MKP instances from commonly used benchmarks available through the Internet are performed. Comparison tables are given for the performance of the explored approach and other good performing EAs found in literature for the MKP. Results show that performance improves greatly when compared with other penalty-based techniques, but the explored approach is still not the best performer among all. However, unlike the explored technique, the EAs using the other constraint handling techniques require a great amount of extra computational effort and need heuristic information specific to the optimization problem. Based on these observations, and the fact that the performance difference between the explored scheme and the better performers is not too high, research on improving the explored approach is still in progress.|Sima Uyar,Gülsen Eryigit","16274|IJCAI|2005|An Heuristic Search based Approach for Moving Objects Tracking|Fast and accurate tracking of moving objects in video streams is a critical process in computer vision.

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) using evolution strategies for its optimization problem frequently deliver better results with respect to the optimization criterion and the prediction accuracy. Moreover, evolutionary computation allows for the efficient large margin optimization of a huge family of new kernel functions, namely non-positive semi definite kernels as the Epanechnikov kernel. For these kernel functions, evolutionary SVM even outperform other learning methods like the Relevance Vector Machine. In this paper, we will discuss another major advantage of evolutionary SVM compared to traditional SVM solutions we can explicitly optimize the inherent trade-off between training error and model complexity by embedding multi-objective optimization into the evolutionary SVM. This leads to three advantages first, it is no longer necessary to tune the SVM parameter C which weighs both conflicting criteria. This is a very time-consuming task for traditional SVM. Second, the shape and size of the Pareto front give interesting insights about the complexity of the learning task at hand.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times.

Alternative query models have been proposed to give users the ability to query the database without schema knowledge. Those models, including simple keyword search and labeled keyword search, aim to extract meaningful data fragments that match the structure-free query conditions (e.g., keywords) based on various matching semantics. Typically, the matching semantics are content-based they are defined on data node inter-relationships and incur significant query evaluation cost. Our first contribution is a novel matching semantics based on analyzing the database schema. We show that query models employing a schema-based matching semantics can reduce query evaluation cost significantly while maintaining or even improving result quality. The adoption of schema-based matching semantics does not change the nature of those query models they are still schema-ignorant, i.e., users express no schema knowledge (except the labels in labeled keyword search) in the query. While those models work well for some queries on some databases, they often encounter problems when applied to complex queries on databases with complex schemas. Our second contribution is a novel query model that incorporates partial schema knowledge through the use of schema summary. This new summary-aware query model, called Meaningful Summary Query (MSQ), seamlessly integrates summary-based structural conditions and structure-free conditions, and enables ordinary users to query complex databases. We design algorithms for evaluating MSQ queries, and demonstrate that MSQ queries can produce better results against complex databases when compared with previous approaches, and that they can be efficiently evaluated.|Cong Yu,H.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

Holistic twig query processing techniques ,  have been developed to minimize the intermediate results, namely, those root-to-leaf path matches that are not in the final twig results. However, useless path matches cannot be completely avoided, especially when there is a parent-child relationship in the twig query. Furthermore, existing approaches do not consider the fact that in practice, in order to process XPath or XQuery statements, a more powerful form of twig queries, namely, Generalized-Tree-Pattern (GTP)  queries, is required. Most existing works on processing GTP queries generally calls for costly post-processing for eliminating redundant data andor grouping of the matching results.In this paper, we first propose a novel hierarchical stack encoding scheme to compactly represent the twig results. We introduce TwigStack, a bottom-up algorithm for processing twig queries based on this encoding scheme. Then we show how to efficiently enumerate the query results from the encodings for a given GTP query. To our knowledge, this is the first GTP matching solution that avoids any post path-join, sort, duplicate elimination and grouping operations. Extensive performance studies on various data sets and queries show that the proposed TwigStack algorithm not only has better twig query processing performance than state-of-the-art algorithms, but is also capable of efficiently processing the more complex GTP queries.|Songting Chen,Hua-Gang Li,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Wang-Pin Hsiung,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

Specifically, with the help of computers, we discovered exact conditions that capture the strong equivalence between a rule and the empty set, between two rules, between two rules and one of the two rules, between two rules and another rule, and between three rules and two of the three rules.|Fangzhen Lin,Yin Chen","16270|IJCAI|2005|Incorporating a folding rule into inductive logic programming|Many inductive logic programming systems have operators reorganizing the program so far inferred, such as the intra-construction operator of CIGOL. At the same time, there is a similar reorganizing operator, called the \"folding rule,\" developed in program transformation. We argue that there are advantages in using an extended folding rule as a reorganizing operator for inductive-inference systems. Such an extended folding rule allows an inductive-inference system not only to recognize already-learned concepts, but also to increase the efficiently of execution of inferred programs.|David A.

However, DLs and LP are based on quite different principles, so achieving a seamless integration is not trivial. In this paper, we introduce hybrid MKNF knowledge bases that faithfully integrate DLs with LP using the logic of Minimal Knowledge and Negation as Failure (MKNF) Lifschitz, . We also give reasoning algorithms and tight data complexity bounds for several interesting fragments of our logic.|Boris Motik,Riccardo Rosati","16067|IJCAI|2005|Declarative and Computational Properties of Logic Programs with Aggregates|We investigate the properties of logic programs with aggregates. We mainly focus on programs with monotone and antimonotone aggregates (LPm,aA programs). We define a new notion of unfounded set for (LPm,aA programs, and prove that it is a sound generalization of the standard notion of unfounded set for aggregate-free programs. We show that the answer sets of an LPm,aA program are precisely its unfounded-free models. We define a well-founded operator WP for LPm,aA programs we prove that its total fixpoints are precisely the answer sets of P, and its least fixpoint WPw() is contained in the intersection of all answer sets (if P admits an answer set). WPW() is efficiently computable, and for aggregate-free programs it coincides with the well-founded model. We carry out an in-depth complexity analysis in the general framework, including also nonmonotone aggregates. We prove that monotone and anti-monotone aggregates do not increase the complexity of cautious reasoning, which remains in co-NP. Nonmonotone aggregates, instead, do increase the complexity by one level in the polynomial hierarchy. Our results allow also to generalize and speed-up ASP systems with aggregates.|Francesco Calimeri,Wolfgang Faber,Nicola Leone,Simona Perri","16316|IJCAI|2005|Ordering Heuristics for Description Logic Reasoning|We present a new architecture for Description Logic implementations, a range of new optimisation techniques and an empirical analysis of their effectiveness.|Dmitry Tsarkov,Ian Horrocks","16356|IJCAI|2007|Embedding Non-Ground Logic Programs into Autoepistemic Logic for Knowledge-Base Combination|In the context of the Semantic Web, several approaches to the combination of ontologies, given in terms of theories of classical first-order logic, and rule bases have been proposed. They either cast rules into classical logic or limit the interaction between rules and ontologies. Autoepistemic logic (AEL) is an attractive formalismwhich allows to overcome these limitations, by serving as a uniform host language to embed ontologies and nonmonotonic logic programs into it. For the latter, so far only the propositional setting has been considered. In this paper, we present several embeddings of normal and disjunctive non-ground logic programs under the stable-model semantics into first-order AEL, and compare them in combination with classical theories, with respect to stable expansions and autoepistemic consequences. Our results reveal differences and correspondences of the embeddings and provide a useful guidance in the choice of a particular embedding for knowledge combination.|Jos de Bruijn,Thomas Eiter,Axel Polleres,Hans Tompits","16739|IJCAI|2007|Complexity Results for Checking Equivalence of Stratified Logic Programs|Recent research in nonmonotonic logic programming under the answer-set semantics focuses on different notions of program equivalence. However, previous results do not address the important classes of stratified programs and its subclass of acyclic (i.e., recursion-free) programs, although they are recognized as important tools for knowledge representation and reasoning. In this paper, we consider such programs, possibly augmented with constraints. Our results show that in the propositional setting, where reasoning is well-known to be polynomial, deciding strong and uniform equivalence is as hard as for arbitrary normal logic programs (and thus coNP-complete), but is polynomial in some restricted cases. Nonground programs behave similarly. However, exponential lower bounds already hold for small programs (i.e., with constantly many rules). In particular, uniform equivalence is undecidable even for small Horn programs plus a single negative constraint.|Thomas Eiter,Michael Fink,Hans Tompits,Stefan Woltran","16539|IJCAI|2007|Epistemic Reasoning in Logic Programs|Although epistemic logic programming has an enhanced capacity to handle complex incomplete information reasoning and represent agents' epistemic behaviours, it embeds a significantly higher computational complexity than non-disjunctive and disjunctive answer set programming. In this paper, we investigate some important properties of epistemic logic programs. In particular, we show that Lee and Lifschitz's result on loop formulas for disjunctive logic programs can be extended to a special class of epistemic logic programs. We also study the polysize model property for epistemic logic programs. Based on these discoveries, we identify two non-trivial classes of epistemic logic programs whose consistency checking complexity is reduced from PSPACE-complete to NP-complete and P -complete respectively. We observe that many important applications on epistemic representation fall into these two classes of epistemic logic programs.|Yan Zhang","16108|IJCAI|2005|Strong Equivalence for Logic Programs with Preferences|Recently, strong equivalence for Answer Set Programming has been studied intensively, and was shown to be beneficial for modular programming and automated optimization. In this paper we define the novel notion of strong equivalence for logic programs with preferences. Based on this definition we give, for several semantics for preference handling, necessary and sufficient conditions for programs to be strongly equivalent. These results provide a clear picture of the relationship of these semantics with respect to strong equivalence, which differs considerably from their relationship with respect to answer sets. Finally, based on these results, we present for the first time simplification methods for logic programs with preferences.|Wolfgang Faber,Kathrin Konczak","16752|IJCAI|2007|A Description Logic of Change|We combine the modal logic S with the description logic (DL) ALCQI. The resulting multi-dimensional DL SALCQI supports reasoning about change by allowing to express that concepts and roles change over time. It cannot, however, discriminate between changes in the past and in the future. Our main technical result is that satisfiability of SALCQI concepts with respect to general TBoxes (including GCIs) is decidable and -EXPTIME-complete. In contrast, reasoning in temporal DLs that are able to discriminate between past and future is inherently undecidable. We argue that our logic is sufficient for reasoning about temporal conceptual models with time-stamping constraints.|Alessandro Artale,Carsten Lutz,David Toman"]]}}
