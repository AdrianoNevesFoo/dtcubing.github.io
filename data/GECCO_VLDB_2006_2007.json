Besides classification and reinforcement learning tasks, XCS was applied as an effective function approximator. Hereby, XCS learns space partitions to enable a maximally accurate and general function approximation. Recently, the function approximation approach was improved by replacing () hyperrectangular conditions with hyper-ellipsoids and () iterative linear approximation with the recursive least squares method. This paper combines the two approaches assessing the usefulness of each. The evolutionary process is further improved by changing the mutation operator implementing an angular mutation that rotates ellipsoidal structures explicitly. Both enhancements improve XCS performance in various non-linear functions. We also analyze the evolving ellipsoidal structures confirming that XCS stretches and rotates the evolving ellipsoids according to the shape of the underlying function. The results confirm that improvements in both the evolutionary approach and the gradient approach can result in significantly better performance.|Martin V. Butz,Pier Luca Lanzi,Stewart W.

As an important branch of learning classifier systems, XCS has been proven capable of evolving maximally accurate, maximally general problem solutions. However, in practice, it oftentimes generates a lot of rules, which lower the readability of the evolved classification model, and thus, people may not be able to get the desired knowledge or useful information out of the model. Inspired by the fault tolerance mechanism proposed in field of data mining, we devise a new XCS framework by integrating the concept and mechanism of fault tolerance into XCS in order to reduce the number of classification rules and therefore to improve the readability of the generated prediction model. A series of $N$-multiplexer experiments, including -bit, -bit, -bit, and -bit multiplexers, are conducted to examine whether XCSFT can accomplish its goal of design. According to the experimental results, XCSFT can offer the same level of prediction accuracy on the test problems as XCS can, while the prediction model evolved by XCSFT consists of significantly fewer classification rules.|Hong-Wei Chen,Ying-Ping Chen","57733|GECCO|2006|Fast rule matching for learning classifier systems via vector instructions|Over the last ten years XCS has become the standard for Michigan-style learning classifier systems (LCS). Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time.

The goal of such a model is to classify examples (records or data instances) into classes or categories of the same type. The use of variables (attributes) not related to the classes can reduce the accuracy and reliability of a classification or prediction model.

The proposed algorithm deals with discrete variables, and its population of candidate solutions contains particles of different sizes. The performance of this algorithm is compared with the performance of a standard binary PSO algorithm on the task of selecting attributes in a bioinformatics data set.

In this paper we show that PSO appears to work well on \"single-funnel\" optimization functions. On more complex optimization problems, PSO tends to converge too quickly and then fail to make further progress. We contend that most benchmarks for PSO have classically been demonstrated on single-funnel functions. However, in practice, optimization tasks are more complex and possess higher problem dimensionality. We present empirical results that support our conjecture that PSO performs well on single-funnel functions but tends to stagnate on more complicated landscapes.|Andrew M.

Furthermore, G-PSO adopts a \"reactive\" determination of the step size, based on feedback from the last iterations. This is in contrast to the basic particle swarm algorithm, in which the particles explore the search space by using both the individual \"cognitive\" component and the \"social\" knowledge and no feedback is used for the self-tuning of algorithm parameters.

While in PSO, particles are moving toward directions determined by certain global information, such as the global best particle. In order to leverage the specialties offered by both sides to our advantage, this paper combines the essential mechanism of ES and the key concept of PSO to develop a new hybrid optimization methodology, called particle swarm guided evolution strategy.

A large portion of the unbiased sample may become less relevant over time because of evolution. An analytical or mining task (eg. query estimation) which is specific to only the sample points from a recent time-horizon may provide a very inaccurate result. This is because the size of the relevant sample reduces with the horizon itself. On the other hand, this is precisely the most important case for data stream algorithms, since recent history is frequently analyzed. In such cases, we show that an effective solution is to bias the sample with the use of temporal bias functions. The maintenance of such a sample is non-trivial, since it needs to be dynamically maintained, without knowing the total number of points in advance. We prove some interesting theoretical properties of a large class of memory-less bias functions, which allow for an efficient implementation of the sampling algorithm. We also show that the inclusion of bias in the sampling process introduces a maximum requirement on the reservoir size. This is a nice property since it shows that it may often be possible to maintain the maximum relevant sample with limited storage requirements. We not only illustrate the advantages of the method for the problem of query estimation, but also show that the approach has applicability to broader data mining problems such as evolution analysis and classification.|Charu C.

In this paper, we describe a load shedding technique for queries consisting of one or more aggregate operators with sliding windows. We introduce a new type of drop operator, called a \"Window Drop\". This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

The recently developed Cell processor is a good example of a heterogeneous multi-core architecture and provides a powerful platform for executing data stream operators with high-performance. On the down side, exploiting the full potential of a multi-core processor like Cell is often challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous nature of the processing elements, the software managed local memory at the co-processor side, and the unconventional programming model in general. In this paper, we study the problem of scalable execution of windowed stream join operators on multi-core processors, and specifically on the Cell processor. By examining various aspects of join execution flow, we determine the right set of techniques to apply in order to minimize the sequential segments and maximize parallelism. Concretely, we show that basic windows coupled with low-overhead pointer-shifting techniques can be used to achieve efficient join window partitioning, column-oriented join window organization can be used to minimize scattered data transfers, delay-optimized double buffering can be used for effective pipelining, rate-aware batching can be used to balance join throughput and tuple delay, and finally SIMD (single-instruction multiple-data) optimized operator code can be used to exploit data parallelism. Our experimental results show that, following the design guidelines and implementation techniques outlined in this paper, windowed stream joins can achieve high scalability (linear in the number of co-processors) by making efficient use of the extensive hardware parallelism provided by the Cell processor (reaching data processing rates of &ap  GBsec) and significantly surpass the performance obtained form conventional high-end processors (supporting a combined input stream rate of  tuplessec using  minutes windows and without dropping any tuples, resulting in &ap . times higher output rate compared to an SSE implementation on dual .Ghz Intel Xeon).|Bugra Gedik,Philip S.

In this paper, we examine the problem of how to schedule CQs in a DSMS to optimize for average QoS. We show that unlike standard on-line systems, scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will be different than policies that optimize for average slowdown which is more appropriate metric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. We also propose a hybrid scheduling policy based on slowdown that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness. We further discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploit sharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs. Finally, we experimentally show using real data that our policies outperform currently used ones.|Mohamed A. Sharaf,Panos K.

In sharp contrast to standard information integration architectures, a dataspace management system is a data-coexistence approach it does not require any investments in semantic integration before querying services on the data are provided. Rather, a dataspace can be gradually enhanced over time by defining relationships among the data. Defining those integration semantics gradually is termed pay-as-you-go information integration , as time and effort (pay) are needed over time (go) to provide integration semantics. The benefits are better query results (gain). This paper is the first to explore pay-as-you-go information integration in dataspaces. We provide a technique for declarative pay-as-you-go information integration named iTrails. The core idea of our approach is to declaratively add lightweight 'hints' (trails) to a search engine thus allowing gradual enrichment of loosely integrated data sources. Our experiments confirm that iTrails can be efficiently implemented introducing only little overhead during query execution. At the same time iTrails strongly improves the quality of query results. Furthermore, we present rewriting and pruning techniques that allow us to scale iTrails to tens of thousands of trail definitions with minimal growth in the rewritten query size.|Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles,Jens-Peter Dittrich,Shant Kirakos Karakashian,Olivier Ren√© Girard,Lukas Blunschi","80654|VLDB|2006|InteMon Intelligent System Monitoring on Large Clusters|InteMon is a prototype monitoring and mining system for large clusters.

In many data stream applications, processing delay is the most critical quality requirement since the value of query results decreases dramatically over time. The ability to remain within a desired level of delay is significantly hampered under situations of overloading, which are common in data stream systems. When overloaded, DSMSs employ load shedding in order to meet quality requirements and keep pace with the high rate of data arrivals. Data stream applications are extremely dynamic due to bursty data arrivals and time-varying data processing costs. Current approaches ignore system status information in decision-making and consequently are unable to achieve desired control of quality under dynamic load. In this paper, we present a quality management framework that leverages well studied feedback control techniques. We discuss the design and implementation of such a framework in a real DSMS - the Borealis stream manager. Our data management framework is built on the advantages of system identification and rigorous controller analysis. Experimental results show that our solution achieves significantly fewer QoS (delay) violations with the same or lower level of data loss, as compared to current strategies utilized in DSMSs. It is also robust and bears negligible computational overhead.|Yi-Cheng Tu,Song Liu,Sunil Prabhakar,Bin Yao"],["57615|GECCO|2006|Hyper-ellipsoidal conditions in XCS rotation linear approximation and solution structure|The learning classifier system XCS is an iterative rule-learning system that evolves rule structures based on gradient-based prediction and rule quality estimates. Besides classification and reinforcement learning tasks, XCS was applied as an effective function approximator. Hereby, XCS learns space partitions to enable a maximally accurate and general function approximation. Recently, the function approximation approach was improved by replacing () hyperrectangular conditions with hyper-ellipsoids and () iterative linear approximation with the recursive least squares method. This paper combines the two approaches assessing the usefulness of each. The evolutionary process is further improved by changing the mutation operator implementing an angular mutation that rotates ellipsoidal structures explicitly. Both enhancements improve XCS performance in various non-linear functions. We also analyze the evolving ellipsoidal structures confirming that XCS stretches and rotates the evolving ellipsoids according to the shape of the underlying function. The results confirm that improvements in both the evolutionary approach and the gradient approach can result in significantly better performance.|Martin V. Butz,Pier Luca Lanzi,Stewart W.

First, it formally shows that XCS implements a method of generalized RL based on linear approximators, in which the usual input mapping function translates the state-action space into a niche relative fitness space. Then, it shows that, although XCS has always been related to standard RL, XCS is actually a method of averaging RL. More precisely, XCS with gradient descent can be actually derived from the typical update of averaging RL. It is noted that the use of averaging RL in XCS introduces an intrinsic preference toward classifiers with a smaller fitness in the niche. It is argued that, because of the accuracy pressure in XCS, this results in an additional preference toward specificity. A very simple experiment is presented to support this hypothesis.

Specifically, we counterbalance the imbalance ratio by equalizing the reproduction probabilities of the most occurring and least occurring niches. The study provides guidelines to tune XCS's parameters for unbalanced datasets, based on the dataset imbalance ratio.

As an important branch of learning classifier systems, XCS has been proven capable of evolving maximally accurate, maximally general problem solutions. However, in practice, it oftentimes generates a lot of rules, which lower the readability of the evolved classification model, and thus, people may not be able to get the desired knowledge or useful information out of the model. Inspired by the fault tolerance mechanism proposed in field of data mining, we devise a new XCS framework by integrating the concept and mechanism of fault tolerance into XCS in order to reduce the number of classification rules and therefore to improve the readability of the generated prediction model. A series of $N$-multiplexer experiments, including -bit, -bit, -bit, and -bit multiplexers, are conducted to examine whether XCSFT can accomplish its goal of design. According to the experimental results, XCSFT can offer the same level of prediction accuracy on the test problems as XCS can, while the prediction model evolved by XCSFT consists of significantly fewer classification rules.|Hong-Wei Chen,Ying-Ping Chen","58201|GECCO|2007|Empirical analysis of generalization and learning in XCS with gradient descent|We analyze generalization and learning in XCS with gradient descent. At first, we show that the addition of gradient in XCS may slow down learning because it indirectly decreases the learning rate. However, in contrast to what was suggested elsewhere, gradient descent has no effect on the achieved generalization. We also show that when gradient descent is combined with roulette wheel selection, which is known to be sensitive to small values of the learning rate, the learning speed can slow down dramatically. Previous results reported no difference in the performance of XCS with gradient descent when roulette wheel selection or tournament selection were used. In contrast, we suggest that gradient descent should always be combined with tournament selection, which is not sensitive to the value of the learning rate. When gradient descent is used in combination with tournament selection, the results show that (i) the slowdown in learning is limited and (ii) the generalization capabilities of XCS are not affected.|Pier Luca Lanzi,Martin V.

Simple crossover operators were replaced by recombination based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The combination showed that XCS with such a statistics-based crossover operator can solve challenging hierarchical functions more efficiently. This study elaborates the gained competence further investigating the coding scheme for the EDA component (BOA in our case) of XCS as well as performance in randomly generated Boolean function problems. Results in hierarchical Boolean functions show that the originally used -bit coding scheme induces a certain learning bias that stresses additional diversity in the evolving XCS population. A -bit coding scheme as well as a restricted -bit coding scheme confirm the suspected bias. The alternative encodings decrease the unnecessary bias towards specificity and increase performance robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges ahead for XCS in Boolean function problems as well as on the implications of the obtained results for real-valued and multiple-valued classification problems, multi-step problems, and function approximation problems.|Martin V.

Traditional mask-based crossover operators for binary strings (e.g., one-point and uniform) tend to decrease the diversity of solutions in EMO algorithms while they improve the convergence to the Pareto front. This is because such a crossover operator, which is called geometric crossover, always generates an offspring in the segment between its two parents under the Hamming distance in the genotype space. That is, the sum of the distances from the generated offspring to its two parents is always equal to the distance between the parents. In this paper, first we propose a non-geometric binary crossover operator to generate an offspring outside the segment between its parents. Next we examine the effect of the use of non-geometric binary crossover on single-objective genetic algorithms. Experimental results show that non-geometric binary crossover improves their search ability. Then we examine its effect on EMO algorithms. Experimental results show that non-geometric binary crossover drastically increases the diversity of solutions while it slightly degrades their convergence to the Pareto front. As a result, some performance measures such as hypervolume are clearly improved.|Hisao Ishibuchi,Yusuke Nojima,Noritaka Tsukamoto,Ken Ohara","57960|GECCO|2007|A new crossover technique for Cartesian genetic programming|Genetic Programming was first introduced by Koza using tree representation together with a crossover technique in which random sub-branches of the parents' trees are swapped to create the offspring.

Genetically robust solutions are solutions that are less likely to be degraded by genetic operators, such as crossover. Previous work has shown that there is significant evolutionary pressure in favor of genetically robust solutions and that evolving programs adopt a number of strategies to increase genetic robustness, notably an increase in inoperative 'genes' (individual genetic units that don't influence fitness) and a preference for 'genes' with a relatively small effect on fitness.Here we examine the role of genes that cancel each other out. We find that allowing such 'canceling genes' leads to an overall increase in the rate of code growth, both through the inclusion of self-canceling code and through a general increase in introns. Finally, we find that the evolution generally follows a two-step process. Initially the operative code evolves rapidly to achieve a (near) optimal fitness. Then, the inoperative code begins to evolve most rapidly to increase robustness. In an extreme case of a problem that can be solved with no operative genes, individuals evolve by losing all operative genes and then losing all inoperative genes.|Xue Zhong,Terence Soule","57874|GECCO|2006|Evolving musical performance profiles using genetic algorithms with structural fitness|This paper presents a system that uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) to evolve hierarchical pulse sets (i.e., hierarchical duration vs. amplitude matrices) for expressive music performance by machines.

Evolution-based methods evolve their programs after task execution because they must calculate fitness values, while reinforcement learning can change programs during task execution, therefore the programs can be created efficiently. The second important point is that GNP uses candlestick chart and selects appropriate technical indices to judge the buying and selling timing of stocks. The third important point is that sub-nodes are used in each node to determine appropriate actions (buyingselling) and to select appropriate stock price information depending on the situation.

With sporadic model building, the structure of the probabilistic model is updated once every few iterations (generations), whereas in the remaining iterations only model parameters (conditional and marginal probabilities) are updated. Since the time complexity of updating model parameters is much lower than the time complexity of learning the model structure, sporadic model building decreases the overall time complexity of model building. The paper shows that for boundedly difficult nearly decomposable and hierarchical optimization problems, sporadic model building leads to a significant model-building speedup that decreases the asymptotic time complexity of model building in hBOA by a factor of (n .) to (n .), where n is the problem size. On the other hand, sporadic model building also increases the number of evaluations until convergence nonetheless, the evaluation slowdown is insignificant compared to the gains in the asymptotic complexity of model building.|Martin Pelikan,Kumara Sastry,David E.

Machine learning is used to learn probabilistic models of the selected population. This model is then used to generate next population via sampling. An important phenomenon in machine learning from data is called overfitting. This occurs when the model is overly adapted to the specifics of the training data so well that even noise is encoded. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether overfitting happens in EDAs, and to discover its consequences. What is found is overfitting does occur in EDAs overfitting correlates to EDAs performance reduction of overfitting using early stopping can improve EDAs performance.|Hao Wu,Jonathan L.

When doneproperly, such scaling has been shown to preventpremature convergence on slope-like regions ofthe search space. In this paper we specificallyfocus on one way of scaling that was previouslyintroduced as Adaptive Variance Scaling (AVS). It wasfound that when using AVS, the average number offitness evaluations grows subquadratically withthe dimensionality on a wide range of unimodaltest-problems, competitively with the CMA-ES.Still, room for improvement exists because thevariance doesn't always have to be scaled. Apreviously introduced trigger based on correlationthat determines when to apply scaling was shownto fail on higher dimensional problems. Here weprovide a new solution called the Standard-DeviationRatio (SDR) trigger that is integrated with theIterated Density-Estimation Evolutionary Algorithm(IDEA). Intuitively put, scaling istriggered with SDR only if improvements are foundto be far away from the mean. SDR works even inhigh dimensions as a result of factorizing thedecision rule behind the trigger according to theestimated Bayesian factorization. We evaluateSDR-AVS-IDEA on the same set ofbenchmark problems and compare it with AVS-IDEAand CMA-ES. We find that the addition of SDR givesAVS-IDEA an important extra edgefor it to be used in future research and inapplications both in single-objective optimizationas well as in multi-objective and dynamicoptimization. In addition, we provide practical rulesof thumb for parameter settings for usingSDR-AVS-IDEA that result in anasymptotic scale-up behavior that is sublinearfor the population size (O(l.)) andsubquadratic (O(l.)) for thenumber of evaluations.|Peter A.

Genetic programming has been considered a promising approach for function approximation since it is possible to optimize both the functional form and the coefficients. However, it is not easy to find an optimal set of coefficients by using only non-adjustable constant nodes in genetic programming.

Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents. Our results show that both agents exhibit interesting learning capabilities.|Gul Muhammad Khan,Julian Francis Miller,David M.

Using a very limited set of ab initio and experimental data, semiempirical parameters are reoptimized to provide globally accurate potential energy surfaces, thereby eliminating the need for full-fledged ab initio dynamics simulations, which are very expensive. Through reoptimization of the semiempirical methods, excited-state energetics are predicted accurately, while retaining accurate ground-state predictions. The results show that the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm consistently yields solutions that are significantly better---up to % lower error in the energy and .% lower error in the energy-gradient---than those reported in the literature. Multiple high-quality parameter sets are obtained that are verified with quantum dynamical calculations, which show near-ideal behavior on critical and untested excited state geometries. The results demonstrate that the reparameterization strategy via evolutionary algorithms is a promising way to extend direct dynamics simulations of photochemistry to multi-picosecond time scales.|Kumara Sastry,D.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams.

Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated.

The combined score function is usually linear. To efficiently answer top-k queries, preprocessing and indexing the data have been used to speed up the run time performance. Many indexing methods allow the online query algorithms progressively retrieve the data and stop at a certain point. However, in many cases, the number of data accesses is sensitive to the query parameters (i.e., linear weights in the score functions).In this paper, we study the sequentially layered indexing problem where tuples are put into multiple consecutive layers and any top-k query can be answered by at most k layers of tuples. We propose a new criterion for building the layered index. A layered index is robust if for any k, the number of tuples in the top k layers is minimal in comparison with all the other alternatives. The robust index guarantees the worst case performance for arbitrary query parameters. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for robust index. The problem is shown solvable within O(ndlog n) (where d is the number of dimensions, and n is the number of tuples). To reduce the high complexity of the exact solution, we develop an approximate approach, which has time complexity O(d n(log n)r(d)-), where r(d)  d + d d.

Such an approach has two drawbacks ) it leaves many partial similarities uncovered ) the distance is often affected by a few dimensions with high dissimilarity. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the k-n-match problem in this paper.The k-n-match problem models similarity search as matching between the query object and the data objects in n dimensions, where n is a given integer smaller than dimensionality d and these n dimensions are determined dynamically to make the query object and the data objects returned in the answer set match best. The k-n-match query is expected to be superior to the kNN query in discovering partial similarities, however, it may not be as good in identifying full similarity since a single value of n may only correspond to a particular aspect of an object instead of the entirety. To address this problem, we further introduce the frequent k-n-match problem, which finds a set of objects that appears in the k-n-match answers most frequently for a range of n values. Moreover, we propose search algorithms for both problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of individual attributes retrieved, which is especially useful for information retrieval from multiple systems. We can also apply the proposed algorithmic strategy to achieve a disk based algorithm for the (frequent) k-n-match query.

However, this model is not suitable for processing concurrent distributed queries because the foundation, the memory-disk hierarchy, does not exist for data provided by remote sources. Therefore, the query engine cannot exploit any data sharing so that each process will have to interact with data sources independently issue data requests and fetch data over the network. This paper presents Request Window, a novel DQP mechanism that can detect and employ data sharing opportunities across concurrent distributed queries. By combining multiple similar data requests issued to the same data source to a common data request, Request Window allows concurrent query executing processes to share the common result data. With the benefits of reduced source burdens and data transfers, the throughput of query engine can be significantly improved. This paper also introduces the IGNITE system, an extended PostgreSQL with DQP support. Our experimental results show that Request Window makes IGNITE achieve a .x speedup over a commercial data integration system when running a workload of distributed TPC-H queries.|Rubao Lee,Minghong Zhou,Huaming Liao","80852|VLDB|2007|Efficient Processing of Top-k Dominating Queries on Multi-Dimensional Data|The top-k dominating query returns k data objects which dominate the highest number of objects in a dataset. This query is an important tool for decision support since it provides data analysts an intuitive way for finding significant objects. In addition, it combines the advantages of top-k and skyline queries without sharing their disadvantages (i) the output size can be controlled, (ii) no ranking functions need to be specified by users, and (iii) the result is independent of the scales at different dimensions. Despite their importance, top-k dominating queries have not received adequate attention from the research community. In this paper, we design specialized algorithms that apply on indexed multi-dimensional data and fully exploit the characteristics of the problem. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform a previous skyline-based approach, while our results on real datasets show the meaningfulness of top-k dominating queries.|Man Lung Yiu,Nikos Mamoulis"],["58119|GECCO|2007|Multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination for large-scale data|Web mining - data mining for web data - is a key factor of web technologies. Especially, web behavior mining has attracted a great deal of attention recently. Behavior mining involves analyzing the behavior of users, finding patterns of user behavior, and predicting their subsequent behaviors or interests. Web behavior mining is used in web advertising systems or content recommendation systems. To analyze huge amounts of data, such as web data, data-clustering techniques are usually used. Data clustering is a technique involving the separation of data into groups according to similarity, and is usually used in the first step of data mining. In the present study, we developed a scalable data-clustering algorithm for web mining based on existent evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithm. To derive clusters, we applied multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination (MOCK). It has been reported that MOCK shows better performance than k-means, agglutination methods, and other evolutionary clustering algorithms. MOCK can also find the appropriate number of clusters using the information of the trade-off curve. The k-determination scheme of MOCK is powerful and strict. However the computational costs are too high when applied to clustering huge data. In this paper, we propose a scalable automatic k-determination scheme. The proposed scheme reduces Pareto-size and the appropriate number of clusters can usually be determined.|Nobukazu Matake,Tomoyuki Hiroyasu,Mitsunori Miki,Tomoharu Senda","80731|VLDB|2007|DataScope Viewing Database Contents in Google Maps Way|People have been relying on Google Maps, MapQuest, or other similar services to find desired locations on maps, browse surrounding businesses, get driving directions, etc..

Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables.\" We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than  million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.|Daniel J.

Data management continues to grow, more than doubling in data and transaction volumes every two years with a growth in deployments to fuel a $ billion market. A continuous stream of innovations in capabilities, robustness, and features lead to new, previously infeasible data-intensive applications. Yet forty years of DBMS innovation are pushing DBMSs beyond the complexity barrier where one-size-fits-all DBMSs do not meet the requirements of emerging applications.

Computer Science . will mark the end of the Computing Era with its focus on technology and the beginning of the Problem Solving Era with its focus on higher levels of abstraction and automation (i.e., intelligent) tools for real world (i.e., imprecise) domains in which approximate and ever-changing answers are the norm. This confluence of limitations of conventional DBMSs, the explosive growth of previously unimagined applications and data, and the genuine need for problem solving will result in a new world of data management. The data management world should embrace these opportunities and provide leadership for data management in Computer Science .. Two emerging areas that lack such guidance are service-oriented computing and the semantic web. While concepts and standards are evolving for data management in service-oriented architectures, data services or data virtualization has not been a focus of the DBMS research or products communities. Missing this opportunity will be worse than missing the Internet. The semantic web will become the means by which information is accessed and managed with modest projections of  billion pages with hundreds of triples per page - the largest distributed system in the world - the only one.

However, traditional information retrieval techniques are likely to be expensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and algorithm that can efficiently evaluate keyword search queries over virtual (unmaterialized) XML views. An interesting aspect of our approach is that it exploits indices present on the base data and thereby avoids materializing large parts of the view that are not relevant to the query results. Another feature of the algorithm is that by solely using indices, we can still score the results of queries over the virtual view, and the resulting scores are the same as if the view was materialized. Our performance evaluation using the INEX data set in the Quark  open-source XML database system indicates that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient.|Feng Shao,Lin Guo,Chavdar Botev,Anand Bhaskar,Muthiah Chettiar,Fan Yang 0002,Jayavel Shanmugasundaram","80848|VLDB|2007|Reasoning about the Behavior of Semantic Web Services with Concurrent Transaction Logic|The recent upsurge in the interest in Semantic Web services and the high-profile projects such as the WSMO, OWLS, and SWSL, have drawn attention to the importance of logic-based modeling of the behavior of Web services.

These include (i) relief from the high mining cost, (ii) minimization of demands in resources, and (iii) effective centralized mining for multiple distributed owners. On the other hand, security is an issue the service provider should be prevented from accessing the actual data since (i) the data may be associated with private information, (ii) the frequency analysis is meant to be used solely by the owner. This paper proposes substitution cipher techniques in the encryption of transactional data for outsourcing association rule mining. After identifying the non-trivial threats to a straightforward one-to-one item mapping substitution cipher, we propose a more secure encryption scheme based on a one-to-n item mapping that transforms transactions non-deterministically, yet guarantees correct decryption. We develop an effective and efficient encryption algorithm based on this method. Our algorithm performs a single pass over the database and thus is suitable for applications in which data owners send streams of transactions to the service provider. A comprehensive cryptanalysis study is carried out. The results show that our technique is highly secure with a low data transformation cost.|Wai Kit Wong,David W.

An algorithm for efficiently computing full disjunctions is presented. This algorithm is superior to previous ones in three ways. First, it is the first algorithm that computes a full disjunction with a polynomial delay between tuples. Hence, it can be implemented as an iterator that produces a stream of tuples, which is important in many cases (e.g., pipelined query processing and Web applications). Second, the total runtime is linear in the size of the output. Third, the algorithm employs a novel optimization that divides the relation schemes into biconnected components, uses a separate iterator for each component and applies outerjoins whenever possible. Combining efficiently full disjunctions with standard SQL operators is discussed.

However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams.

We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries.

A particular challenge when considering such weights in query processing is that results need to be ranked accordingly. Answering keyword-based queries on weighted graphs is shown to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we first show that answering queries with further structure imposed on them remains NP-hard. We next show that, while the query evaluation task can be viewed in terms of ranked structural-joins along query axes, the monotonicity property, necessary for ranked join algorithms, is violated. Consequently, traditional ranked join algorithms are not directly applicable. Thus, we establish an alternative, sum-max monotonicity property and show how to leverage this for developing a self-punctuating, horizon-based ranked join (HR-Join) operator for ranked twig-query execution on data graphs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation schemes and the HR-join operator for merging ranked sub-results under sum-max monotonicity.|Yan Qi 0002,K.

In such an analysis, critical numerical measures, such as profit and sales, fluctuate over time and form time-series data. Moreover, the time series data correspond to market segments, which are described by a set of attributes, such as age, gender, education, income level, and product-category, that form a multi-dimensional structure. To better understand market dynamics and predict future trends, it is crucial to study the dynamics of time-series in multi-dimensional market segments. This is a topic that has been largely ignored in time series and data cube research. In this study, we examine the issues of anomaly detection in multi-dimensional time-series data. We propose time-series data cube to capture the multi-dimensional space formed by the attribute structure. This facilitates the detection of anomalies based on expected values derived from higher level, \"more general\" time-series. Anomaly detection in a time-series data cube poses computational challenges, especially for high-dimensional, large data sets. To this end, we also propose an efficient search algorithm to iteratively select subspaces in the original high-dimensional space and detect anomalies within each one. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution.|Xiaolei Li,Jiawei Han","80834|VLDB|2007|Self-Organizing Schema Mappings in the GridVine Peer Data Management System|GridVine is a Peer Data Management System based on a decentralized access structure.

In this demonstration, we present a set of algorithms to automatically organize the network of schema mappings.

The agents are controlled by a new kind of computational network based on a compartmentalised model of neurons. We have taken the view that the genetic basis of neurons is an important  and neglected aspect of previous approaches. Accordingly, we have defined a collection of chromosomes representing various aspects of the neuron soma, dendrites and axon branches, and synaptic connections. Chromosomes are represented and evolved using a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian Genetic Programming. The network formed by running the chromosomal programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change in response to environmental interactions. The idea of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the genetic transfer of learned experience and life time learning. The learning is a consequence of the complex dynamics produced as a result of interaction (coevolution) between two intelligent agents.

Double-deck elevators, where two cages are connected with each other, are expected to be the next generation elevator systems. Meanwhile, Destination Floor Guidance Systems (DFGS) are also expected in Double-Deck Elevator Systems (DDES). With these, the passengers could be served at two consecutive floors and could input their destinations at elevator halls instead of conventional systems without DFGS. Such systems become more complex than the traditional systems and require new control methods Genetic Network Programming (GNP), a graph-based evolutionary method, has been applied to EGSCS and its advantages are shown in some previous papers. GNP can obtain the strategy of a new hall call assignment to the optimal elevator because it performs crossover and mutation operations to judgment nodes and processing nodes. In studies so far, the passenger's arrival has been assumed to take Exponential distribution for many years. In this paper, we have applied Erlang distribution and Binomial distribution in order to study how the passenger's arrival distribution affects EGSCS.

The main idea of the proposed method is to combine a forecasting technique with an evolutionary algorithm. The location, in variable space, of the optimal solution (or of the Pareto optimal set in multi-objective problems) is estimated using a forecasting method. Then, using this forecast, an anticipatory group of individuals is placed on and near the estimated location of the next optimum. This prediction set is used to seed the population when a change in the objective landscape arrives, aiming at a faster convergence to the new global optimum. The forecasting model is created using the sequence of prior optimum locations, from which an estimate for the next location is extrapolated. Conceptually this approach encompasses advantages of memory methods by making use of information available from previous time steps. Combined with a convergencediversity balance mechanism it creates a robust algorithm for dynamic optimization. This strategy can be applied to single objective and multi-objective problems, however in this work it is tested on multi-objective problems.

Eight variants were implemented and tested on  benchmark problems taken from the specialized literature. These variants vary in the type of recombination operator used and also in the way in which the mutation is computed.

We consider this problem for XML databases. We consider an attack model where the attacker may possess exact knowledge about the domain values and their occurrence frequencies, and we wish to protect sensitive structural information as well as value associations. We capture such security requirements using a novel notion of security constraints. For security reasons, sensitive parts of the hosted database are encrypted. There is a tension between data security and efficiency of query evaluation for different granularities of encryption. We show that finding an optimal, secure encryption scheme is NP-hard. For speeding up query processing, we propose to keep metadata, consisting of structure and value indices, on the server. We want to prevent the server, or an attacker who gains access to the server, from learning sensitive information in the database. We propose security properties for such a hosted XML database system to satisfy and prove that our proposal satisfies these properties. Intuitively, this means the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution about which candidate database led to the given encrypted database, by looking at the encrypted database as well as the metadata. We also prove that by observing a series of queries and their answers, the attacker cannot improve his prior belief probability distribution over which sensitive queries (structural or value associations) hold in the hosted database. Finally, we demonstrate with a detailed set of experiments that our techniques enable efficient query processing while satisfying the security properties defined in the paper.|Hui Wang,Laks V. S.

We develop this idea for the evaluation of boolean XPath queries over a tree that is fragmented, both horizontally and vertically over a number of sites. The key idea is to send the whole query to each site which partially evaluates, in parallel, the query and sends the results as compact boolean functions to a coordinator which combines these to obtain the result. This approach has several advantages. First, each site is visited only once, even if several fragments of the tree are stored at that site. Second, no prior constraints on how the tree is decomposed are needed, nor is any structural information about the tree required, such as a DTD. Third, there is a satisfactory bound on the total computation performed on all sites and on the total network traffic. We also develop a simple incremental maintenance algorithm that requires communication only with the sites at which changes have taken place moreover the network traffic depends neither on the data nor on the update. These results, we believe, illustrate the usefulness and potential of partial evaluation in distributed systems as well as centralized xml stores for evaluating XPath queries and beyond.|Peter Buneman,Gao Cong,Wenfei Fan,Anastasios Kementsietsidis","80862|VLDB|2007|Raster databases|Since the launch of Google Earth at the latest it is clear that online services for multi-Terabyte satellite imagery are becoming integral part of our Internet experience.

In this paper we propose an alternative approach to materializing probabilistic views, by giving conditions under which a view can be represented by a block-independent disjoint (BID) table. Not all views can be represented as BID tables and so we propose a novel partial representation that can represent all views but may not define a unique probability distribution. We then give conditions on when a query's value on a partial representation will be uniquely defined. We apply our theory to two applications query processing using views and information exchange using views. In query processing on probabilistic data, we can ignore the lineage and use materialized views to more efficiently answer queries. By contrast, if the view has explicit lineage, the query evaluation must reprocess the lineage to compute the query resulting in dramatically slower execution. The second application is information exchange when we do not wish to disclose the entire lineage, which otherwise may result in shipping the entire database. The paper contains several theoretical results that completely solve the problem of deciding whether a conjunctive view can be represented as a BID and whether a query on a partial representation is uniquely determined. We validate our approach experimentally showing that representable views exist in real and synthetic workloads and show over three magnitudes of improvement in query processing versus a lineage based approach.|Christopher Re,Dan Suciu","80649|VLDB|2006|Creating Probabilistic Databases from Information Extraction Models|Many real-life applications depend on databases automatically curated from unstructured sources through imperfect structure extraction tools.

Traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness of answer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes, even if they wind up being relevant to a user query. Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such possible answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being pertinent answers to the query. The autonomous nature of web databases poses several challenges in realizing this objective. Such challenges include the restricted access privileges imposed on the data, the limited support for query patterns, and the bounded pool of database and network resources in the web environment. We introduce a novel query rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges. Our technique involves reformulating the user query based on mined correlations among the database attributes. The reformulated queries are aimed at retrieving the relevant possible answers in addition to the certain answers. QPIAD is able to gauge the relevance of such queries allowing tradeoffs in reducing the costs of database query processing and answer transmission. To support this framework, we develop methods for mining attribute correlations (in terms of Approximate Functional Dependencies), value distributions (in the form of Na&iumlve Bayes Classifiers), and selectivity estimates. We present empirical studies to demonstrate that our approach is able to effectively retrieve relevant possible answers with high precision, high recall, and manageable cost.|Garrett Wolf,Hemal Khatri,Bhaumik Chokshi,Jianchun Fan,Yi Chen,Subbarao Kambhampati"],["80825|VLDB|2007|Efficiently Answering Top-k Typicality Queries on Large Databases|Finding typical instances is an effective approach to understand and analyze large data sets.

We model typicality in large data sets systematically. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical NBA players\", the measure of simple typicality is developed. To answer questions like \"Who are the top-k most typical guards distinguishing guards from other players\", the notion of discriminative typicality is proposed.

The efficient evaluation of top-k queries has been an active research topic and many different instantiations of the problem, in a variety of settings, have been studied. However, techniques developed for conventional, centralized or distributed databases are not directly applicable to highly dynamic environments and on-line applications, like data streams. Recently, techniques supporting top-k queries on data streams have been introduced. Such techniques are restrictive however, as they can only efficiently report top-k answers with respect to a pre-specified (as opposed to ad-hoc) set of queries. In this paper we introduce a novel geometric representation for the top-k query problem that allows us to raise this restriction. Utilizing notions of geometric arrangements, we design and analyze algorithms for incrementally maintaining a data set organized in an arrangement representation under streaming updates. We introduce query evaluation strategies that operate on top of an arrangement data structure that are able to guarantee efficient evaluation for ad-hoc queries. The performance of our core technique is augmented by incorporating tuple pruning strategies, minimizing the number of tuples that need to be stored and manipulated. This results in a main memory indexing technique supporting both efficient incremental updates and the evaluation of ad-hoc top-k queries. A thorough experimental study evaluates the efficiency of the proposed technique.|Gautam Das,Dimitrios Gunopulos,Nick Koudas,Nikos Sarkas","80674|VLDB|2006|Safety Guarantee of Continuous Join Queries over Punctuated Data Streams|Continuous join queries (CJQ) are needed for correlating data from multiple streams. One fundamental problem for processing such queries is that since the data streams are infinite, this would require the join operator to store infinite states and eventually run out of space. Punctuation semantics has been proposed to specifically address this problem. In particular, punctuations explicitly mark the end of a subset of data and, hence, enable purging of the stored data which will not contribute to any new query results. Given a set of available punctuation schemes, if one can identify that a CJQ still requires unbounded storage, then this query can be flagged as unsafe and can be prevented from running. Unfortunately, while punctuation semantics is clearly useful, the mechanisms to identify if and how a particular CJQ could benefit from a given set of punctuation schemes are not yet known. In this paper, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for checking whether a CJQ can be safely executed under a given set of punctuation schemes or not. In particular, we introduce a novel punctuation graph to aid the analysis of the safety for a given query. We show that the safety checking problem can be done in polynomial time based on this punctuation graph construct. In addition, various issues and challenges related to the safety checking of CJQs are highlighted.|Hua-Gang Li,Songting Chen,Jun'ichi Tatemura,Divyakant Agrawal,K.

This operator is aware of the window properties (i.e., window size and window slide) of its downstream aggregate operators in the query plan. Accordingly, it logically divides the input stream into windows and probabilistically decides which windows to drop. This decision is further encoded into tuples by marking the ones that are disallowed from starting new windows. Unlike earlier approaches, our approach preserves integrity of windows throughout a query plan, and always delivers subsets of original query answers with minimal degradation in result quality.|Nesime Tatbul,Stanley B.

In particular we study the problem of answering top-k queries using views. A view in this context is a materialized version of a previously posed query, requesting a number of highest ranked values according to some monotone combining function defined on a subset of the attributes of a relation. Several problems of interest arise in the presence of such views. We start by presenting a new algorithm capable of combining the information from a number of views to answer ad hoc top-k queries. We then address the problem of identifying the most promising (in terms of performance) views to use for query answering in the presence of a collection of views. We formalize both problems and present efficient algorithms for their solution. We also discuss several extensions of the basic problems in this setting.We present the results of a thorough experimental study that deploys our techniques on real and synthetic data sets.

In many cases, a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results. Previous work on top-k query processing mainly focuses on optimizing data access according to the ranking function only. The problem of efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections has not been well addressed yet.This paper proposes a new computational model, called ranking cube, for efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections. We define a rank-aware measure for the cube, capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional ranking analysis. Based on the ranking cube, an efficient query algorithm is developed which progressively retrieves data blocks until the top-k results are found. The curse of dimensionality is a well-known challenge for the data cube and we cope with this difficulty by introducing a new technique of ranking fragments.

Top-k queries operate on index lists for a query's elementary conditions and aggregate scores for result candidates. One of the best implementation methods in this setting is the family of threshold algorithms, which aim to terminate the index scans as early as possible based on lower and upper bounds for the final scores of result candidates. This procedure performs sequential disk accesses for sorted index scans, but also has the option of performing random accesses to resolve score uncertainty. This entails scheduling for the two kinds of accesses ) the prioritization of different index lists in the sequential accesses, and ) the decision on when to perform random accesses and for which candidates.The prior literature has studied some of these scheduling issues, but only for each of the two access types in isolation. The current paper takes an integrated view of the scheduling issues and develops novel strategies that outperform prior proposals by a large margin. Our main contributions are new, principled, scheduling methods based on a Knapsack-related optimization for sequential accesses and a cost model for random accesses. The methods can be further boosted by harnessing probabilistic estimators for scores, selectivities, and index list correlations.

These graphs may be enriched with weights, associated with the nodes and edges of the graph, denoting application specific desirabilitypenalty assessments, such as popularity, trust, or cost. A particular challenge when considering such weights in query processing is that results need to be ranked accordingly. Answering keyword-based queries on weighted graphs is shown to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we first show that answering queries with further structure imposed on them remains NP-hard. We next show that, while the query evaluation task can be viewed in terms of ranked structural-joins along query axes, the monotonicity property, necessary for ranked join algorithms, is violated. Consequently, traditional ranked join algorithms are not directly applicable. Thus, we establish an alternative, sum-max monotonicity property and show how to leverage this for developing a self-punctuating, horizon-based ranked join (HR-Join) operator for ranked twig-query execution on data graphs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation schemes and the HR-join operator for merging ranked sub-results under sum-max monotonicity.|Yan Qi 0002,K.

First, it describes the use of genetic programming to automatically synthesize a solution to the challenge problem posed at an international competition held every four years in the field of optical design. In , the competition at the International Optical Design Conference attracted  entries from  well-known optical designers, commercial consultants, and patent holders from many of the field's most prominent companies, universities, and research institutions. The  human contestants spent an average of . hours working on their entries. Virtually all entries were considered good solutions to the challenge problem. Genetic programming automatically synthesized a design \"from scratch\" - that is, without starting from a pre-existing human-created design and without pre-specifying the number of lenses, the physical layout of the lenses, or the numerical or non-numerical parameters of the lenses. The run of genetic programming did not employ any knowledge base of design techniques or principles from the field of optical design and did not entail any human intervention during the run. The genetically evolved optical lens system would have ranked in the middle (st) if it had been entered into the  competition and is therefore an instance of a \"human-competitive\" result produced by genetic programming. Second, this paper presents a mutation operation for numerical constants that is especially appropriate for problems in which the to-be-designed structure contains a large number of non-linearly interrelated numerical values and for problems in which the topology of the solution is to be automatically created.|Lee W.

In this paper we test that hypothesis in a new setting by exploring the GA on a subset of the hdf's which are dynamic---the shaky ladder hyperplane-defined functions (sl-hdf's). In doing so we gain insight into how the GA makes use of crossover during its traversal of the sl-hdf search space. We begin this paper by explaining the sl-hdf's. We then conduct a series of experiments with various crossover rates and various rates of environmental change. Our results show that the GA performs better with than without crossover in dynamic environments. Though these results have been shown on some static functions in the past, they are re-confirmed and expanded here for a new type of function (the hdf) and a new type of environment (dynamic environments). Moreover we show that crossover is even more beneficial in dynamic environments than it is in static environments.

Previous work has found two factors that contribute to the GA's success on sl-hdfs () short initial building blocks and () significantly changing the reward structure during fitness landscape changes. Therefore a test function that combines these two features should facilitate even better GA performance. This has led to the construction of a new sl-hdf variant, \"Defined Cliffs,\" in which we combine short elementary building blocks with sharp transitions in the environment. We examine this variant with two different levels of dynamics, static and regularly changing, using four different metrics.

Despite its symmetry properties, that will be derived here analytically, it seems to capture the complexity of the Fourier transform between the decision space to the evaluation space, and by that to challenge optimization routines. And indeed, counter-intuitively to some extent, locating its global maximum seems to be not an easy task for Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). Although this research originates from the real-world applications domain, it aims to introduce a theoretical test case to Evolution Strategies (ES), being a possible theoretical gateway to the real-world physics regime of quantum control problems. After presenting some theoretical results, this paper introduces the study of the scalability of the decision space subject to optimization by specific variants of Derandomized Evolution Strategies. We show that the Evolution Strategy in use requires a quasi-quadratic increase of function evaluations for locating the global maximum as the dimensionality increases.|Ofer M.

They are simple, easy to understand and inspire confidence. Many of these HAs are good for some problem instances while very poor for other cases. While Meta-Heuristics try to find which is the best heuristic andor parameters to apply for a given problem instance Hyper-Heuristics (HH) try to combine several heuristics in the same solution searching process, switching among them whenever the circumstances vary. Besides, instead to solve a single problem instance it tries to find a general algorithm to apply to whole families of problems. HH use evolutionary methods to search for such a problem-solving algorithm and, once produced, to apply it to any new problem instance desired. Learning Classifier Systems (LCS), and in particular XCS, represents an elegant and simple way to try to fabricate such a composite algorithm. This represents a different kind of problem to those already studied by the LCS community. Previous work, using single step environments, already showed the usefulness of the approach. This paper goes further and studies the novel use of multi-step environments for HH and an alternate way to consider states to see if chains of actions can be learnt. A non-trivial, NP-hard family of problems, the Bin Packing one, is used as benchmark for the procedure. Results of the approach are very encouraging, showing outperformance over all HAs used individually and over previously reported work by the authors, including non-LCS (a GA based approach used for the same BP set of problems) and LCS (using single step environments).|Javier G.

Since the initial CS- work conceived by Holland, classifiers (rules) have widely used a ternary condition alphabet ,, for binary input problems. Most of the freely available implementations of this ternary alphabet in XCS rely on character-based encodings---easy to implement, not memory efficient, and expensive to compute. Profiling of freely available XCS implementations shows that most of their execution time is spent determining whether a rule is match or not, posing a serious threat to XCS scalability. In the last decade, multimedia and scientific applications have pushed CPU manufactures to include native support for vector instruction sets. This paper presents how to implement efficient condition encoding and fast rule matching strategies using vector instructions. The paper elaborates on Altivec (PowerPC G, G) and SSE (Intel PXeon and AMD Opteron) instruction sets producing speedups of XCS matching process beyond ninety times. Moreover, such a vectorized matching code will allow to easily scale beyond tens of thousands of conditions in a reasonable time.

Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies.
